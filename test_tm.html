letter from jeff seabright our business at a glance environmental governance and accountability 2003 in review our environmental performance performance data verification statement letter from doug daft the coca cola company reported record financial and operating results in 2003 we achieved this performance through a strong commercial focus and a commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our business even so we know that the full measure of success for an international enterprise such as ours is not just what we do but how we do it for the coca cola company sustainable success means creating economic value while nurturing and protecting the people and natural resources that are essential to our future consistent with this we understand that the natural resources we require for our business are not infinite and that in many instances we share them with others quite simply we must make the most of them environmental stewardship our commitment to protecting and preserving the environment through the way we conduct our business has been part of the coca cola company is philosophy for more than 30 years over that period it is fair to say that we have not always communicated about such stewardship as clearly as we should have but for a beverage producer committed to using the finest of natural ingredients and to maintaining consistently high qualitysuch considerations have been a constant if understated part of our business framework we have long believed that we must conduct our business in ways that make the least impact on the environment consistent with delivering what our customers demand we know too that our business practices are part of the value people associate with our brands the past two years especially have seen important progress both inside the company and among our bottling partners best practices in key areas are increasingly becoming standard practices everywhere and throughout the system we are steadily institutionalizing concern for environmental issues as ordinary commercial factors we do not pretend to be there yet but we are making real and tangible progress this our second systemwide report on environmental stewardship sets out what we have been doing over the past year and records some specific achievements in two areas in particular our system has made significant progress first we have improved our performance on the main environmental impacts water energy and solid waste second we have sharpened our focus on governance by creating a newly invigorated environment water resources department and appointing a vice president to lead our corporate responsibilities in this area in additionour internal environmental council is helping drive environmental programs and implement improvements throughout the system 2003 also brought some notable challengesprincipally in india and panama the system sought to deal with these in an objective and open manner and the issues involved are outlined in this report ours is a dynamic business and in keeping with our vision of constant improvementwe accept that there will always be lessons to learn from such incidents that will help inform business practices and decisions in the future as i contemplate my retirement from the coca cola company i am confident that we have in place the building blocks for a truly sustainable company in environmental stewardship no less than in other aspects of the business i am proud to pass on a solid foundation of environmental stewardship backed by strong governance sincerely douglas n daft chairman board of directors and chief executive officer letter from jeff seabright constant improvement in environmental performance for our company is both an enormous challenge and a critical business imperative our brands and our reputation are the foundations of our business and environmental excellence in all that we do is an investment that strengthens those assets it also drives improvement in operational efficiency and effectiveness by creating the new environment water resources department last year the coca cola company is demonstrating its determination to strengthen environmental governance throughout our system this atlanta based team provides leadership governance and support for environmental stewardship among our own employees and operations and those of our partners given the nature of our business three environmental priority issues demand our attention water resource management energy and climate change and solid waste and recycling we must strive to continually improve in each of these areas working with our bottling partners through the coca cola environment council we are making real and demonstrable progress in 2003we used 7 percent less water per unit of product and 5 percent less energy per unit of product than in 2002 resulting in cost avoidance of 58 million as well as significant environmental benefit our recycling rate in operating plantshowever declined by 3 percent compared with 2002 levels and this is an area where we will focus our efforts going forward we will work towards doing a better job in capturing environmental performance data and goal setting at the local facility level and throughout our entire system of all the environmental issues we facewater presents the greatest challenges and the coca cola company 2003 environmental report opportunities water is our primary ingredient and is itself a growing product category in the beverage industry it is also a critical natural resource and community asset in all our markets we are already doing a lot of constructive work around the world on water such as our collaboration with the world wildlife fund in europe on water efficiency page 13 and the roundabout playpumps program in africa page 14 however we can and must do more to this end in late 2003 we launched a collaborative effort with our entire system and our stakeholders to assess the water challenges we face more clearly and to identify potential solutions these must reach across the entire water cycle from watershed protection to internal efficiency to community access we believe we have an enormous opportunity to leverage our expertise our investments and our people to be leaders through implementation of programs that will ensure we use water in a sustainable fashion to fulfill this objective the involvement of our bottling partners will be as essential as that of employees in our plants so too will be the support and cooperation of our suppliers in the past few years we have reaffirmed these bonds through our supplier guiding principles and this year we have initiated closer ties with their environmental managers in the key areas of packaging sweeteners juice and other ingredients in the area of energy and climate we are directing significant effort towards our signature program to phase out hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and improve energy efficiency by 40 to 50 percent in cold drink equipment we take the issue of global climate change seriously and are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions that result from our business activities we have made significant technical progress toward identifying hfc free alternatives for future new sales and marketing equipment and have identified carbon dioxide as the hfc free technology of choice for our system thanks to the ongoing commitment of consumers recycling rates for beverage containers continue to be among the highest of any consumer products packaging our system is working harder than ever to reduce the environmental impact of packaging by integrating environmental considerations into our packaging design process advancing the development of recycling collection and processing programspromoting cost effective and efficient local solutions to litter abatement and supporting the development of end use markets this also typifies another aspect of our approach using innovation wherever possible to achieve environmental benefits the coca cola company moved a long time ago from seeing the environment as mainly a legal compliance issue environmental management is embedded in the company is quality management system in order to achieve operational excellence we are now going a step further by aligning our environmental values with our drive for innovation so that packagingproduction facilities equipment and other developments incorporate elements of green design and value i am excited about the opportunities and challenges before us working with our worldwide colleagues our operating divisions our business partners suppliers and bottlers we will continue to improve environmental performance sincerely jeff seabright vice pr esident e nvi ron m e nt wate r r

to as the coca cola system or just the system this report covers the environmental performance of the system as a whole although the system is not a single entity from a legal or a management point of view our bottling relationships we have three types of bottling relationships the corresponding number represents the percent of worldwide unit case volume that each type of bottler produced and distributed in 2003 10 8 bottlers in which the company has a non controlling ownership interest 58 independently owned bottling operations in which the company has no ownership interest 24 bottlers in which the company has a controlling ownership interest 8 the remaining approximately 10 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2003 was produced and distributed by our fountain operations plus our juice juice drinksports drink and other finished beverage operations 10 our relationship with bottling partners we do not own or control is one of collaboration and mutual support these businesses have independent management policies and governance structures many are publicly traded companies with independent share owner structures some are involved in businesses outside the nonalcoholic beverage sector we do not control the policies and programs of these bottling partners but we have mutual self interests and therefore work together to find common ground and take common action in many areas this includes our environmental activities at the end of 2003 the coca cola system owned leased or operated 961 manufacturing facilities around the world our principal environmental impacts because we believe that global businesses should lead and because the economic value of our brands can be affected by everything we dowe take the environmental impacts of our business seriously the

a picture as we can of these impacts our manufacturing process and its primary environmental impacts vending machines coolers ingredients bulk e g lemon oil packaging vanilla cherry flavor concentrate plants bottling plants warehouses water 1 used in our system is plants as product ingredient as well as in operations for processes such as purification washing and rinsing of packagingcleaning of product mixing tanks and piping steam production and cooling 2 wastewater from plants required by company policy to be either treated on site or discharged into public or private sewage systems for treatment before being returned to rivers and other natural bodies of water consumers transport customers greenhouse gas emissions 1 from energy used in manufac turing operations either directly e g in plant boilers fueled by gas or oil or indirectly power plants producing the electricity used in bottling plants 2 from energy use and refrigerant leaks associated with the manufacture operation and disposal of cold drink equipment such as coolers and vending machines 3 from fuel used to power the fleets that deliver our products to retailers waste 1 waste from our system is production facilities includes ingredient containers damaged product containers shrink or stretch film that holds palletized products together biosolids from wastewater treatment plants wood from damaged pallets and compostable material from ingredients such as tea leaves etc 2 waste arising from the disposal of sales and marketing equipment at the end of its useful life 3 packaging waste arising after consumers have enjoyed our products our business at a gl ance environmental governance and accountability environmental management at the coca cola company is a function of governance and accountability at its most basic level this requires regularly updating environmental policies and operating procedures along with management controls to ensure their implementation in addition environmental governance and accountability requires alignment with our bottlers and other business partners engagement with certain outside stakeholders also improves our understanding of external expectations as well as our ability to respond to them internal management controls our company ensures environmental accountability at every level of our organization by implementing environmental policies and programs and by measuring and auditing our environmental performance the audit committee of the coca cola company is board of directors has responsibility for environmental governance in 2003 the company created the role of vice president environment water resources the principal responsibility of this position is to monitor and manage environmental governance and performance across the business system the position reports to the chief innovation and technology officer who reports to the chairman and chief executive officer the vice president is supported by the environment water resources departmentwhich provides technical and policy expertise on our system is operations and environmental impacts among other things the department develops policies guidance and programs on environmental compliance and performance as well as leadership initiatives at the regional level our strategic business units divisions and production facilities have the coca cola company 2003 environmental report dedicated environmental coordinators these environmental coordinators are responsible for ensuring that environmental compliance and performance in their operations are consistent with company environmental policy and standards environmental coordinators collaborate on a regional level and gather yearly for a global meeting audit program since 1993 the company is legal division in partnership with the environment water resources department and its predecessors has managed a corporate environmental audit program all company owned facilities are periodically audited to assess compliance with applicable legal and company requirements the program also assesses the effectiveness of environmental management of all operations as part of our management review processaudit reports are provided by the legal division to executives responsible for audited facilities or operations issues identified during an audit are addressed through a corrective action program in 2003 more than 40 environmental safety and loss prevention audits were conducted at company owned facilities ekosystem and company environmental standards and guidelines our environmental management systemekosystem provides common operating standards for the company and operating guidelines for our bottling partners it incorporates environmental concerns into our day to day operations even in those regions where regulatory standards do not exist or may not be fully enforced in practical terms ekosystem mitigates our environmental impacts and reduces costs and increases efficiencies as forecast in our 2002 environmental reportin 2003 we launched an enhanced version of ekosystem that is more closely aligned with the international environmental management system standard iso 14001 the revised ekosystem documentation includes both management system standards and environmental performance standards in addition to ekosystem our company is environmental standards and guidelines esgs formerly known as good environmental practices geps set out specific requirements and guidelines for significant environmental aspects of our operations in addition to required standards esgs also include guidelines to help operations improve performance in key environmental areas since 1993 esgs have been developed for auditing environmental and safety systems biosolids energy management environmental due diligence fleet management managing hazardous materials measuring and reporting environmental performance ozone protection wastewater quality water resource management engaging with our bottlers and other business partners because so much of the economic value and the environmental impacts of the coca cola system are created by our bottling partners the company is interest in environmental management extends well beyond the facilities we own we work constantly with our bottling partners to develop consistent policies and to achieve continuous improvement in our system is environmental performance we also work with suppliers and customers to minimize the upstream and downstream impacts from our business system coca cola environmental council ccec in 2003 the company and five bottling partnersaccounting for approximately 40 percent of the system is global unit case volume continued to work together to improve environmental management across the business system by promoting best practices and developing and validating environmental standards one of ccec is first objectives was to establish an environmental policy setting framework for the system that would include business units and key bottling partners this process is now being followed for all environmental policy development supply chain and responsible procurement along with ekosystem and esgs we offer periodic environmental training for associates and bottling partners alike waste mart systemwide minimization and reduction techniques trains employees to identify environmental performance improvement and cost saving opportunities in the areas of waterenergy and waste reduction packaging and vending machines coolers and fountain dispensers account for a significant part of the coca cola system is environmental impacts as such the company has concentrated a significant portion of its environmental purchasing efforts on those areas an emerging area for our system is utilities procurement water and energy are key inputs in our production processes we believe there are opportunities to realize environmental benefits and cost savings by leveraging the purchasing power of our system while at the same time optimizing utility efficiency our commercial relationships with suppliers environmental governance and accountabilit y are governed by our supplier guiding principles program which requires compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations we are also working with suppliers to develop environmentally beneficial technologies to date our collective efforts have produced lower weight packaging higher recycled content packaging and greater energy efficiency for cooling equipment moving forward we expect to continue to expand our understanding of the complete lifecycle of our products from ingredient procurement to production to delivery to postconsumer recycling and we are committed to reducing environmental impact at every step we will continue to work with our supply partners to extend our environmental values throughout our supply chain engaging with outside stakeholders we believe many environmental issues are best addressed through partnerships between companies governments nongovernmental organizations and local communities our business and environmental performance benefits from listening to others engaging in constructive and honest dialogue with external stakeholders and respecting their opinions at the international level we belong to several organizations dedicated to addressing global environmental problems these include the world business council for sustainable development where we participate in a water project and a working group on accountability and reporting the global environmental management initiative where we co lead the water sustainability initiative the society for organizational learning is sustainability consortium where we are contributing to a materials pooling working group currently examining packaging issues and business for social responsibility where we participate in a green freight working group addressing the environmental impacts of transportation the coca cola company 2003 environmental report at the national and regional levels we are members of many organizations dedicated to package recycling and anti litter campaigns these include european partners for the environment assurre in europe keep america beautiful the buy recycled business alliance in australia and cempre in brazil in 2003 our environmental advisory board eab held two major meetings established in 2002 the eab is composed of outside experts who inform our company on existing and emerging environmental and sustainability issues through this stakeholder group our chairman and chief executive officer the executive committee and other members of the senior leadership team receive candidindependent advice on environmental matters and on our environmental policy programs and performance in addition to the organizations we engage proactively we try to be responsive to groups that engage us on key environmental issues we maintain an ongoing dialogue with a number of socially responsible investor groups and environmental activist organizations dedicated to water energy and climate and solid waste resource management issues stakeholder feedback on our 2002 environmental report this environmental report plays an important role in our efforts to improve environmental accountability the following themes were identified by external stakeholders as areas to address in future reporting 1 absence of performance targets 5 limited verification statement and the coca cola company has established internal environmental performance goals for our core business operations concentrate manufacturing these goals cover water useenergy use solid waste generation and recycling in addition plants representing more than 40 percent of our volume have established plant specific water efficiency targets stakeholder review statements data and case studies presented in the report are subjected to a rigorous internal and external verification process consistent with other companies environmental reports this year is report includes a 3 page verification statement 6 absence of a vision for the future in terms 2 absence of trend data of reporting mechanisms and the role of envi the 2002 environmental report established the baseline for data the 2003 report has two years worth of data thus we are beginning to establish trends ronmental practices at the coca cola company 3 absence of fleet transportation data although we still lack fleet information for a large part of our system our data set does represent at least half of our distribution system we have extrapolated to estimate our global fleet impacts we will continue to increase our understanding of the complete lifecycle of our products and to improve our environmental performance measures and goals we intend to make continuous progress every year specificallywe have initiated a systemwide strategic assessment of our access to and use of water resources around the world we will use this process to evaluate how we can best ensure sustainable use and adequate protection of this limited resource 4 absence of issues which received unfavorable media attention in 2003 our first environmental report covered calendar year 2002 the most significant issues or challenges we faced in 2003 are addressed in this report these include product safety and water resource issues in india and unauthorized discharge of pollutants into a water body in panama environmental governance and accountabilit y 2003 in review achievements the coca cola system is environmental performance demonstrated solid improvement in 2003 our overall water use declined in 2003even as unit case volume increased 4 percent water use ratios continued to improve in 2003as did energy and solid waste generation ratios full comparisons are provided in the performance data section of this report page 21 to ensure that environmental performance continues to improve the company took the following steps in 2003 appointment of vice president and enhanced environment water resources department for many years the coca cola company has invested financial and human resources specifically toward the objective of improving the coca cola system is worldwide environmental performance in 2003 the company consolidated these resources in a new environment water resources department and created a vice president position to lead the department jeff seabright was appointed to this position in november 2003 jeff brings considerable business environment and public policy expertise to the company including previous experience with the environmental consultancy green strategies texaco and the united states government he served as executive director of the white house task force on climate change and as director for the united states agency for international development usaid first systemwide environmental report although some of our bottling partners and operating divisions had already published environmental reports in 2003 we published the coca cola company 2003 environmental report our first systemwide report on environmental performance the report covering calendar year 2002 established benchmarks for assessing the environmental performance of the company and its bottling partners around the world in this and future reports data from the 2002 environmental report will be used as a baseline for measuring our environmental performance our overall water use declined in 2003 even as unit case volume increased 4 percent water use ratios continued to improve in 2003 as did energy and solid waste generation ratios challenges the company also faced a number of environmental challenges in 2003 these were the most significant water resources in india situation in 2003 our company was part of a national discussion in india regarding the social responsibility of multinational companies local nongovernmental organizations accused the company of not operating as a responsible corporate citizen three specific accusations were made against our company an allegation that a local aquifer was negatively impacted by the rate and manner in which our local bottling plant was withdrawing groundwater an allegation that wastewater treatment operations at our local bottling plants were generating biosolids that contained heavy metals above prescribed limits and an allegation that our local carbonated softdrink products contained unsafe levels of pesticide residues response testing and analysis by the companyindependent laboratories and the indian government confirmed that our products are safe and that our business operations are not the cause of significant negative environmental impacts as part of our commitment to continuous improvement we also undertook the following into the bay of panama which turned a reddishpink color for approximately 24 hours the panama national environmental authority fined the bottler 300000 response our panamanian bottling partner has reaffirmed its commitment to and implementation of the coca cola system is environmental standards and safeguards the company and our bottling partner are taking the steps necessary to ensure that a similar incident does not occur again the plant is standard operating procedure for disposal now requires that containerized liquid waste be disposed of by a pumping serviceand the plant is employees are receiving appropriate training for liquid disposal in addition a new wastewater treatment facility has been designed for the plant with operation scheduled for 2005 through a series of innovations including increasing levels of rainwater harvesting for use in our manufacturing operations we achieved a water use reduction of about 22 percent since 2001 at our plant in the state of kerala our average usage in 2003 was approximately 400 cubic meters per day we re evaluated our characterization and handling of biosolids and issued a new company wide biosolids standard the new standard governs handling and disposal of biosolids worldwide in order to ensure responsible environmental performance we initiated a company wide assessment of our access to and use of water resources around the world specifically we are evaluating ways to ensure sustainable use and adequate protection of this limited resource panama red bay incident situation in may our panamanian bottling partner discharged more than 1000 gallons of beverage concentrate into a canal that flowed into the matasnillo river the river flowed our environmental performance scope and coverage of the report unless otherwise noted this report covers manufacturing plants owned by the company and our bottling partners offices laboratoriesresearch and development laboratories and warehouses are not included data contributed by our bottling partners enable us to offer a more comprehensive picture of the environmental impacts of our business system although we do not have data from all our bottling partners we are able to estimate full system impacts based on the data set we do have data has been collected from 30 out of 30 coca cola concentrate and syrup plants 10 out of 10 plants in our juice and juice drink production facilities 1 out of 1 food service juice concentrate plant 639 out of 915 bottling and canning plants throughout the world 5 out of 5 ccda water plants in north america our 2003 data on distribution fleet performance represents 53 percent of total systemwide unit case volume for each main impact category we have estimated the impacts of our company is operations and those of our bottling partners by extrapolating the data to our system is total production volumes because the operation of sales and marketing equipment is usually beyond the control of the company or our bottling partners we have very little energy consumption data for this equipment however as with energy consumption of appliances or automobile emissions we are able to estimate related environmental impacts using energy consumption data laboratory testing and simulation models there are other environmental impacts over which the coca cola system has limited control we explain upstream and downstream impactsbut because this data is controlled by suppliers and customers we are not able to provide it water total 685 plants average water use collectively the end product volume covered by these 685 plants is 836 billion liters of nonalcoholic beverage products and represents 76 percent of the 2003 end product sales volume of brands owned by the company of the 2003 end product sales volume of brands owned by the company is covered by these 685 plants the coca cola company 2003 environmental report 290 liters of water per liter of product estimated systemwide water use 297 billion liters of water water is our largest ingredient and an increasingly important product category it also is a critical resource for the well being of the communities and watersheds where we operate given its priority we believe that water and its stewardship are critical to the long term sustainability and growth of our business water enters our manufacturing plants first as an input to production our operations obtain water from various sources including municipal water supplies wells lakes rivers and oceans some operations also get water from private water companies water use the average total water use of the operations covered in this report is 290 liters of water per liter of product the plants covered by this report used a total of 208 billion liters of water to produce 718 billion liters of product these products include carbonated and noncarbonated soft drinks teas and coffees and juices in cans and bottles which are directly sold to consumers as well as fountain syrup which must be mixed with water and carbonation in retail fountain equipment before being sold to consumers extrapolation to production volumes not directly covered by our report suggests a total water consumption of 297 billion liters this represents a reduction of 10 billion liters or 3 percent from 2002 effluent like most manufacturing operations our plants generate effluent or wastewater that is produced as a by product of production once it has been used our policy states that the water be cleaned before it is discharged back into the natural environment company standards require that effluent discharged from our facilities into a natural body of water be treated consistent with applicable law at least to a level capable of supporting fish life where municipal treatment facilities are not able to meet that standard the company requires effluent treatment systems on site to demonstrate the effectiveness of our treatment and in addition to laboratory tests we maintain fish habitats ponds and aquariums filled with our treated effluent at more than 152 plants throughout the world in some cases we reuse treated effluent for irrigation or to wash trucks as of the end of 2003 about 78 percent of our system is facilities met our effluent standard and we are working to achieve global compliance in the near future case study ah2orra as in many coastal regions around the worldwater conservation is a serious matter on the spanish mediterranean in 2003 the company is iberian division partnered with world wildlife fund wwf spain and bottling partner colebega to create ah2orra a program intended to promote water conservation and reduce water consumption as part of the initiative schoolchildren were presented with educational materials featuring gotilde a cartoon water drop the materialswhich were developed by wwf spaindelivered the messages that water is essentialand that children can help conserve it colebega leveraged its strong relationships with housewife associations to reach spanish homes women were invited to visit bottling plants where they were given an easy to use water conservation device that reduces water flow housewives were also given a pamphlet that included tips for additional water savings the spanish coca cola system and wwf spain reached out to the private sector by sending jointly developed brochures highlighting the seriousness of the water conservation issue these materials also included suggestions for improving water use in their businesses our environmental performance energy and emissions average energy use 054 megajoules per liter of product estimated systemwide energy use 55 billion megajoules of energy south africa case study roundabout playpump according to the world health organization and unicef 300 million people in africa have no access to water to help address this issue south africa is department of water affairs forestry entered into a public private partnership with roundabout outdoor this local company invented the playpump a playground roundabout that powers a conventional borehole water pump the playpump is capable of producing approximately 1400 liters of water per hour at 16 revolutions per minute from a depth of 40 meters and is effective up to a depth of 100 meters roundabout outdoor and the south african government work together to identify areas with a sufficient groundwater table and water quality after sites have been identifiedroundabout outdoor locates corporate sponsors to underwrite installation of the playpumps with full ownership transferring to communities in 2002 the coca cola company sponsored nine playpump installations in south africa is eastern cape province in 2003the company committed to 50 more with the first 25 in limpopo province with estimates that each playpump can provide water for several thousand people or so at least 200000 rural south africans will now have reliable access to safe drinking water investigation into our climate change footprint revealed that the three largest components of our system is impact on global climate change are manufacturing sales and marketing equipment and fleet transport each of these is predicated on energy consumption as described below manufacturing in 2003 our system consumed 374 billion megajoules mj of energy to produce 686 billion liters of products in the plants covered by our reporting exercise average energy use was 054 mj per liter of product extrapolation of the energy use ratios to production volumes not directly covered by our data suggests an estimated energy consumption of 55 billion mj in 2003 by all system production facilities improvements in energy efficiency in 2003 represent a systemwide reduction in energy consumption from 2002 of approximately 1 billion mj or 2 percent we estimate that this energy consumption leads to direct and indirect emissions of 57 million metric tons of carbon dioxide energy consumption ratios are a function of specific manufacturing operations for examplebecause of pasteurization juice manufacturing uses more energy than fountain syrup manufacturing a variety of local factors such as climateplant size packaging type and use of plastic bottle making equipment also determine energy use plants in our system use a variety of energy sources depending on specific needs and local conditions this figure was updated on august 27 2004 reflecting an error in the original calculation the coca cola company 2003 environmental report ekofreshment in june 2000 the coca cola company announced its intention to no longer purchase new cold drink sales and marketing equipment sme using hydrofluorocarbons hfcs where cost efficient alternatives are commercially available to begin preparing for the transition deadline the company launched ekofreshment to evaluate the commercial potential of alternative sme technologies a worldwide cross functional team representing our bottling partners and our environment financelegal marketing procurement public affairs and communications and research and development functions worked to define the business case for the new technology and to establish an energy efficiency baseline the team also considered the implications of new technologies for our system is supply chain partners as well as equipment transition strategies for customers the ekofreshment team examined a variety of refrigeration alternatives including ammoniacarbon dioxide hydrocarbon magnetic peltierstirling and thermoacoustic technologies after narrowing down the number of alternatives under consideration to three carbon dioxide hydrocarbonand stirling the team evaluated the technologies on the bases of environmental performanceprice application coverage operational cost and regulatory compliance issues extended lab and field testing began in the latter half of 2003 carbon dioxide based refrigeration is the hfc free technology that has emerged as the best option for our system announcements regarding this technology are scheduled for later this yearand will be discussed in more detail in our next environmental report as it becomes available more information will be posted in the environmental section of our website www coca cola com 2003 estimated systemwide greenhouse gas emissions million metric tons of co2 or its equivalent 15 los angeles ca case study los angeles solar roof coca cola enterprises cce los angeles production facility was in need of a new roof in an effort to address rising energy demands at the facility cce investigated the possibility of installing a photovoltaic solar paneled roof at the plant despite california utility rebates the initial quotes were too expensive for serious consideration throughout 2002 and 2003 cce partnered with solar integrated technologies sit to find a mutually beneficial solution sit agreed to cover all costs associated with the installation of a new lighter weight integrated roofing membrane and solar photovoltaic array that can lower the per watt cost of the facility in returnsit is allowed to lease the roof space from cce and to own operate and maintain the system cce has agreed to split the cost savings equally with sit the 325 kilowatt solar roof at the los angeles production facility began generating electricity on february 13 2004 the roof can produce about 1600 usable hours equivalent to 67 days of power annually with an approximate cost savings of more than 60000 per year in addition the cost of a new roof was avoidedand cce does not anticipate significant roof maintenance for 25 years sales and marketing equipment manufacturing operations fleet this figure was updated on august 27 2004 reflecting an error in the original calculation our environmental performance sales and marketing equipment our system utilizes an estimated 9 million coolers vending machines and fountain dispensers worldwide most of these machines keep products cold but some also contain hot products such as ready to drink coffee or tea the environmental impacts of coolers vending machines and fountain dispensers are related to energy as well was the gases used for refrigeration insulation and the solid waste generated at disposal we estimate that greenhouse gas emissions related to sales and marketing equipment are almost three times those from our production facilities solid waste average solid waste generated 1222 grams per liter of product estimated systemwide solid waste generation our bottling partners distribution systems deliver our brands to customers and consumers this distribution system is driven by the need to deliver products to consumers as efficiently as possible efficiency benefits the environment as well as our cost structure our 2003 fuel economy ratio suggests thaton average the fleet consumes approximately 7 liters of diesel per 1000 liters of product delivered it is difficult to estimate the number of distribution vehicles employed by the case study bio gas recovery system one of our japanese bottling partners chukyo coca cola central japan group produces georgia coffee and canned tea products at its tokai plant rather than landfill the waste company bottlers and contract distributorsbut we believe the system owns or operates approximately 180000 vehicles in addition to energy consumption fleet related environmental impacts include exhaust emissions we estimate that greenhouse gas emissions from our system is transportation fleet are roughly one third of those generated in system plants approximately 18 million metric tons the coca cola company 2003 environmental report 125 million metric tons to some outside stakeholders solid waste from our product packaging is our most visible environmental impact many observers also believe that the health of recycling programs recycling of beverage containers other consumer product packaging and materials reflects consumers commitment to the environment packaging facilitates consumption of our beverages and plays a critical role in our marketing generated by the facility chukyo coca cola began composting its waste stream a natural by product of composting is methane a greenhouse gas in order to address this issue the tokai plant launched a pilot study using a bio gas recovery methanefermentation system this process ferments the plant is waste and uses the resulting methane gas to help power boilers and for heating and cooling the technology was field tested in 2001 and 2002 and resulted in an 85 percent reduction in solid waste volume while producing 20000 gj of energy the system is expected to be fully operational in late 2004 case study nascar recycling in november 2001 the coca cola company and the national association of pet container resources launched a pilot recycling collection program at atlanta motor speedway during the napa 500 stock car race this initial effort utilized bags bins kiosks and other collection mechanisms to collect more than 6000 pounds of bottles and cans this pilot also helped improve our understanding of waste composition around the world but of course it also creates an obvious environmental challenge what to do with the package after the beverage has been consumed in our business the environmental impact of our product packaging is an important issueone where we spend focused time and effort more broadly solid waste is an issue in various parts of our supply chain for the purposes of this report we focus on the area of productionwhere the most concentrated volumes of waste material are generated waste in production in 2003 the production of 6181 billion liters of products in the plants covered by our reporting exercise yielded 755600 metric tons of solid waste on average each liter of product generated 1222 grams of solid waste our system reused or recycled almost three quarters or 74 percent of all solid waste produced in these plants we discarded an average of 32 grams of at nascar tracks the next nascar recycling initiative the samsung radioshack 500 at texas motor speedway in march 2003 was expanded to include the speedway campground approximately 45000 campers received blue recycling bags to facilitate collections at nine recycling trailers located throughout campground areas in all 6760 pounds of aluminum beverage containers and 3360 pounds of pet were collected in may 2003 we launched a more ambitious effort at lowe is motor speedway lms in charlotte north carolina the lms project encompassed two races held over two weekends with 50 collection kiosks along the main concourse and 20 in the campgrounds over the two week period 25901 pounds nearly 13 tons of recyclable beverage containers were recovered solid waste per liter of product extrapolation of waste ratios suggests an estimated total generation of industrial solid waste by our business system of 125 million metric tons in 2003 an increase of 1 percent from 2002 of this total 925000 metric tons were reused or recycled and 329000 metric tons were discarded compared with 2002 this represents an increase of 38000 metric tons of solid waste discarded in 2003 as with energy consumption the range of solid waste production ratios throughout our system is heavily influenced by local conditions these include product mix and packaging mix in general though our system is solid waste is a function of production packaging and design production waste includes materials such as empty ingredient containers e g drumspails jugs cardboard slip sheets that separate layers of palletized cans as they arrive our environmental performance shrink or stretch film and or plastic strapping that holds palletized products together biosolids from wastewater treatment plants glass or plastic from damaged bottles wood from damaged pallets and ingredient waste such as tea leaves our system uses a wide range of packaging materials thirteen percent of our volume is sold as concentrated syrup in fountain outlets syrup packaging is usually bag in the box or 5 gallon refillable stainless steel containers stainless steel and polyethylene plastics in sizes from 1 gallon to more than 1000 liters are used to supply concentrate and beverage bases to bottling plants our bottling partners in turndeliver our products in refillable bottles 23 percent of our volume or in bottles cans or other packaging that generally is recyclable 63 percent numbers do not add to 100 percent due to rounding package waste packaging is a key point of differentiation and a source of competitive advantage for us for that to continue our stakeholders must have confidence in the environmental integrity of the packages we offer we are working harder than ever to maintain this trust by systematically integrating environmentally sound practices across the entire lifecycle of our packages design we work closely with our packaging teams to minimize the environmental impact of packaging by institutionalizing design criteria into our development and commercialization process this means maximizing the raw materials used to produce our packaging exploring opportunities for reuse of packaging materials designing packaging with its end use in mind maximizing recycled content materials as appropriate and supporting new eco packaging innovations the coca cola company 2003 environmental report recovery worldwide recovery rates for beverage containers are among the highest of any consumer products packaging our system is actively involved in numerous programs designed to further increase these rates by advancing our understanding of sustainable solutions for diverting packaging materials from the waste and litter streams because community waste streams and management approaches vary from one country to another we typically tailor our recovery efforts to national and local conditions end use we work to support development of end use markets for recycled packaging material most notably our efforts to obtain regulatory approval in various countries across the world have encouraged and facilitated development of technologies for providing beverage companies with recycled content packaging material while our use of recycled material varies from market to market we are committed to using it where cost competitive with virgin material we also work with recycling companies to encourage the use of products and materials made from recycled packaging case study recycle and win in 1996 the brazil division launched the coca cola recycle and win program to help build a recycling infrastructure and encourage a culture of recycling in the country the initiative began with local schools and today includes more than 4500 partner institutions in 19 of brazil is 26 states since 1996recycle and win has collected and recycled case study greek environmental education in october 2001 the coca cola company partnered with the greek nongovernmental organization elliniki etairia hellenic company for the protection of the environment and cultural heritage to sponsor panhellenic research on greek awareness of environmental issues the project conducted by the research company focus revealed that despite environ more than 2800 tons of post consumption packages including more than 1300 tons of pet bottles and 1200 tons of aluminum cans along with minimizing the environmental impact of post consumer waste one important aspect of recycling is building a market for recycled materials recycle and win has made an important contribution toward this objective for example the rio de janeiro recycling cooperative riocoop 2000 has increased its monthly collection from 10 tons to 90 tons since its establishment in 2000 mental awareness among young peopleschoolchildren lacked information and opportunities about how to contribute to a healthier environment in response to the research findingsthe coca cola company and elliniki etairia agreed on a three year action plan 2002 through 2004 to improve environmental education in greece for the 2002 2003 school year the company worked with elliniki etairia to sponsor an environmental education program for high school students the curriculum was developed by an environmental educator and supervised by elliniki etairia in the initial phase the program was implemented in 16 schools 12 in athens and 4 in salonica with materials delivered to approximately 700 students our environmental performance case study recycling in mexico in mexico the coca cola system is improving its environmental performance by creating recycling opportunities inside and outside its facilities at the pacabtum bottling plant in southern mexico an analysis revealed that more than one third of the waste generated by the facility in 2001 was not being recycled to consider whether this performance might be improvedthe plant conducted a detailed study of the waste it created over a one week period in january 2002 the analysis determined that of the 359 tons of waste generated during the week 305 tons about 85 percent could be recycled after additional analyses showed that the main causes of the recycling shortfall were a poorly developed segregation infrastructure and limited knowledge of segregation processes 20 the coca cola company 2003 environmental report the plant built a segregation infrastructure from used postmix containers and developed a training course by june 2002 nonrecycled waste had fallen to 1150 kilograms per month from 2050 kilograms in december 2001 a decrease of almost 44 percent the mexican coca cola system is working to increase post consumer recycling in 2002the coca cola system and a number of other mexican beverage industry companies including several competitors created ecoce a nonprofit association charged with creating a market for post consumer pet bottles in 2003 the company joined femsaits largest mexican bottling partner and the plastics company alpla mexico in founding imer using ecoce as its main supplierimer will recycle post consumer pet bottles into food grade flake for direct contact bottleto bottle recycling the pet recycling facility in toluca is currently under construction and will be the first of its kind in latin america the plant is expected to have a capacity of 17000 tons per year of food grade

verification statement verification objectives and scope urs verification ltd ursvl was commissioned by the coca cola company the company to provide third party verification of environmental data and claims presented in its 2003 environmental report the report key objectives of the verification included reviewing the transparency and completeness of the environmental information reported effectiveness of data collection collation and validation systems accuracy of environmental performance data within a sample of divisions and bottlers and implementation and communication of environmental arrangements within the company responsibilities of directors and verifiers the information contained in the coca cola company 2003 environmental report is the sole responsibility of the company this verification statement represents the independent opinion of ursvl the ursvl project team members have not been involved in the development of the company 2003 environmental report or associated environmental programs and data or information collection systems verification method the approach followed by ursvl is aligned to iso iec guide 66 and international accreditation forum iaf guidance to this document iaf gd 6 2003 these are international frameworks outlining the general requirements for bodies operating independent assessment and certification registration of the coca cola company 2003 environmental report environmental management systems ursvl environmental auditors conducted the verification process following the general principles of environmental auditing and audit procedures as contained within the international standards iso 19011 we have also embedded in our approach certain principles of the global reporting initiative gri and the aa1000 assurance framework the ursvl process has therefore involved review of the report to identify material information in the data and text that constitute claims or assertions made by the company review of each identified claim or assertion against the supporting evidence to determine its accuracy and appropriateness review of data management processes used for environmental performance data focusing on the validation mechanisms to verify robustness and assess the potential for errors within the 2003 data set interviews with key personnel involved in preparation and validation of the report interviews with key personnel involved in managing environmental performance at a corporate and division level plus key bottler representatives as well and review of a sample of corporate division and bottler information documentation reportsguidelines and other relevant material associated with managing environmental performance the corporate and division interviews focused on a sample of divisions from each of the company is geographic operating segments strategic business units in africa asia europe eurasia middle east latin america and north america together with a range of key bottler representatives opinion accuracy the environmental performance reporting system is effective generating data which when aggregated at a corporate level is generally accurate reliable and indicative of the overall environmental performance of the coca cola system however there continue to be minor inefficiencies in the systems and processes used for the collection and management of data at corporate and division levels in the sample of data and information checked by ursvl some minor inconsistencies were identified which have wherever practicalbeen addressed by the coca cola company however a greater degree of confidence in data accuracy would be achieved from an improved response rate and checking of source data at a site level the approach to data validation and the identification of systemic errors is generally appropriate when applied to the companyowned plants but continues to provide a lower level of assurance for sites outside the direct control of the company as a result there remains potential for material errors to occur in the aggregated figures in this second environmental report there is evidence of maturing internal validation systems and therefore textual claims and statements made by the coca cola company are generally supported by evidence obtained during the verification process transparency and completeness ursvl understands that the coca cola company is environmental report is intended to cover only its key environmental strategiesprocesses and performance indicators it is ursvl is opinion that the text and data presented in this report reflect the company is key environmental impacts however the depth and emphasis of coverage may not reflect the level of investment and management focus for a number of topic areas ursvl welcomes the company is move towards greater transparency in disclosure of environmental challenges and trend data as the report develops deeper coverage of how the company intends to improve its environmental performance would present a more representative view of the company is response to current and future challenges facing the business the company has made an encouraging start to the inclusion of stakeholder opinions in this report we look forward to increasing responsiveness to stakeholders and their more direct influence on the issues covered in this written report environmental arrangements environmental programs across the coca cola system have continued to progress in the past year there remains however considerable progress to be made on alignment of these programs to a higher level company vision and strategy this would provide a more coherent framework that can drive future environmental performance and reporting this strategic framework would enable easier development of specific objectives and targets against which performance could be benchmarked and more transparent reporting could be achieved ursvl identified that environmental issues are considered in a number of decision making processes however these are not currently strategically aligned to a systemwide risk control framework a more systematic and integrated approach to identification and control of systemwide environmental risks into core business systems should provide mechanisms for effective communication and management of key environmental risks ursvl recognises the substantial effort made towards introducing a new governance structure for managing environmental issues at a corporate level including initiating a process for reporting on environmental issues to the board there continues to be evolution in roles and responsibilities and we look forward to these showing benefits in environmental controls the company engages with a wide range of stakeholders on environmental issues howevergreater benefit could be achieved through more formal programs and mechanisms to identifyunderstand and engage with key stakeholders ursvl commends the ongoing commitment to working with key bottlers on a range of business issues including the environment and in particular the coca cola environment council we look forward to seeing further progress as this forum expands and develops opinion and directly influence issues covered in the report establish and report on targets to enable tracking of performance associated with the environmental strategy implementation and develop systems and processes in response to new roles and responsibilities to ensure that operational and decision making structures are aligned to improve the effectiveness of environmental controls suggestions for improvements based on the above opinion and scope of work the following suggestions should enable continued improvement in the company is environmental programmes and reporting identify and implement possible mechanisms and or incentives that could facilitate further improvements in data collection and validation at corporate division and site levels including source data

partnerships with communities governments and environmental groups and engaging with our bottling partners to establish quantitative targets for our water use efficiency in 2004 we took a major step in reducing the potential climate impact of our cooling equipment coolers and vending machines by honoring our commitment to work with bottlers to transition our system toward hydrofluorocarbon free refrigerants as a result of extensive testing carbon dioxide co2 based refrigeration has clearly emerged as the safest most reliable and most energy efficient hydrofluorocarbon free cooling alternative for our business we are now working toward full commercialization of this technology and encouraging the wider industry to follow suit an effort that is being conducted in close collaboration with other global corporations along with the united nations environment programme and greenpeace international we are also embarking on a new more comprehensive approach in the area of consumer packaging we have long been a leader in reducing the environmental impact of packaging through innovative design resource efficiency and encouraging recycling and reuse we are now bringing these efforts together into an integrated global strategy that addresses the entire lifecycle of our packaging through all these activities we are deepening our commitment to engagement and open

america our business at a glance the coca cola system the company and its bottling partners for the most part our concentrates and syrups as well as some finished beverages are sold to bottling and canning operationsdistributors fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers the coca cola company and our bottling partners together make up what we refer to as the coca cola system or the system this 2004 environmental report covers the performance of the system as a whole although the system is not a single entity from a legal or a management point of view our relationship with bottling partners we do not own or control is one of collaboration and mutual support these businesses have independent management policies and governance structures many are publicly traded companies with independent shareowner structures some are involved in businesses outside the nonalcoholic beverage sector we do not control the policies and programs of these bottling partners but we have mutual self interests and therefore work together to find common ground and take common action in many areas this includes our environmental activities at the end of 2004 the coca cola system owned leased or operated 867 production facilities around the world our bottling relationships the coca cola company has three types of bottling relationships the corresponding number represents the percentage of worldwide unit case volume that each type of bottler produced and distributed in 2004 58 bottlers in which the company has invested and has a noncontrolling ownership interest 7 25 independently owned

worldwide unit case volume in 2004 was produced and distributed by our fountain operations plus our juice juice drink sports drink and other finished beverage operations our principal environmental impacts in addition to the company and our bottling partners the environmental impact of our business extends throughout our value chain including upstream to our suppliers these include suppliers to the company of flavors and other ingredients for our concentrates and syrups as well as providers to our bottling partners of supplies needed in the production of finished beverages such as bottles cans and other packaging sugar and other sweeteners and co2 for carbonation downstream to distributors customers and consumers our bottling partners deliver finished beverages through one of the world is largest and most complex distribution systems to retail customers around the world ranging from supermarket chains to restaurants of all kinds to small convenience stores and street vendors these retail customers then sell our beverages to our consumers who purchase nearly 13 billion servings each day our business at a glance the following illustration depicts the key relationships that comprise this value chain along with their environmental impacts this report reflects our commitment to providing a full picture of these impacts our manufacturing process and associated environmental impacts vending machines coolers ingredients bulk packaging e g lemon oil vanilla cherry flavor concentrate plants bottling plants warehouse transport consumers ingredients packaging e g water sweeteners co2 customers water 1 used in our system is plants as a product ingredient as well as in operations for processes such as purification washing and rinsing of packaging cleaning of product mixing tanks and piping steam production and cooling 2 wastewater from plants required by company policy to be either treated on site or discharged into public or private sewage systems for treatment before being returned to rivers and other natural bodies of water greenhouse gas emissions 1 from energy used in manufacturing operations either directly e g inplant boilers fueled by gas or oil or indirectly power plants producing the electricity used in bottling plants 2 from energy use and unintentional refrigerant leaks associated with the manufacture operation and disposal of cold drink equipment such as coolers and vending machines 3 from fuel used to power the fleets that deliver our products to customers waste 1 waste from our system is production facilities including ingredient

ingredients such as tea leaves etc 2 waste arising from the disposal of sales and marketing equipment at the end of its useful life 3 packaging waste arising after consumers have enjoyed our products the coca cola company is core operations consist of company owned concentrate and syrup production however some of the main environmental impacts of our business occur further along our value chain through our system is bottling operations distribution networks and sales and marketing activities managing environmental performance across this business value chain becomes more complex outside the core operations controlled by the company but as a responsible environmental steward we continually strivetogether with our business partners to minimize our impacts at every step in the process moving forward we will also continue to expand our understanding of the complete environmental impact of our business through the entire lifecycle of our products from ingredient procurement to production delivery sales and marketing and post consumer recycling 2004 in review as part of our commitment to transparency and accountability we highlight here some of the key achievements and most significant challenges in our environmental performance during 2004 more detail on each of these items can be found in the relevant sections of this report achievements in 2004 our environmental performance improved in all key impact areas water energy and emissions and solid waste for the third consecutive year our system is water use continued to decline as did energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases average solid waste generation also declined further while recycling rates increased additionally we took some significant steps in 2004 on programs aimed at ensuring continued improvement in our environmental performance while working with stakeholders to find shared solutions to pressing environmental problems global water initiative having clearly identified water as a global environmental priority for our business in 2004 we launched the coca cola global water initiative an integrated program aimed not only at ensuring our own responsible use of water but also at contributing to sustainable water resource management in local communities as a first step during 2004 we conducted a detailed analysis of water risks facing our business in more than 840 locations around the world this major effort will provide the basis for developing programs to enhance efficient water use in our operations while partnering with communities to better manage their water resources climate change our efforts to develop climate friendly refrigeration technology took a major step forward in 2004 with the selection of an alternative hfc free technology based on co2 which we are now working with suppliers partners and other beverage sector companies to commercialize this development was unveiled at a refrigerants naturally conference in brussels in june 2004 with the support of governments and nongovernmental organizations and we successfully tested the technology at the 2004 olympic games in athens stakeholder engagement committed to continually enhancing our dialogue with stakeholders in 2004 we took this dialogue to a new level with our first stakeholder forum focused on water a number of outside experts from government nongovernmental organizations and academiaas well as employees including senior management gathered to discuss global water issues and the implications for the company reaction was highly positive about the event as it provided an opportunity for open dialogue and debate other forums will be planned periodically to address other environmental issues 2004 in review over the past two years questions have been raised about our environmental practices in india three specific accusations have been made against our company groundwater an allegation that our local bottling plant was depleting the aquifer in kerala by unreasonably withdrawing groundwater biosolids an allegation that the biosolids a material composed of both organic and inorganic substances that results from waste water treatment processes generated at our local bottling plants contained heavy metals above prescribed limits and pesticides an allegation that our carbonated soft drinks contained unsafe levels of pesticide residues we take these concerns seriously and we continually work to ensure that our products and practices are world class and safe we believe that these issues are challenges that arise through working in emerging economies in our opinion the balance of evidence including testing and analysis by independent laboratories and the indian government show that the allegations against coca cola have not been substantiated we have recognized the importance of sustainable environmental and water management in india and our plans for continuous improvement in this area are well under way to ensure we continue on this path further work is required to continuously improve our practices address the challenges and to improve relations with our partners and stakeholders as a company we are strongly committed to making that journey some of our key actions in this area are outlined further below groundwater protecting and managing water resources for all uses and users is a critical challenge in india as an industrial water user we are continuously working to reduce our water use and environmental impact recent updates on the allegations related to groundwater depletion include an independent study commissioned by the high court of kerala found that under normal rainfall conditions the planned groundwater withdrawal of 5 lakh liters per day by the coca cola factory will not adversely affect the availability of groundwater in the chittur block however groundwater withdrawal by the coca cola factory has to be strictly controlled in those years in which the rainfall is much less than the mean value based on this assessment the high court of kerala concurred and determined that the primary cause of the water shortage in the local kerala area was reduced rainfall during the last several years and that the company has the right to withdraw and use water from the local aquifer for use by its kerala bottling plant the coca cola company specifically has reduced our water use ratios in india by 24 percent between 2000 and 2004 from 512 liters per liter of product to 39 we have installed rainwater harvesting systems in 22 of our plants and in a number of communities and we are expanding these efforts our rainwater harvesting initiative in india is designed to return a substantial percentage of the water we remove from the aquifers we have recently initiated an agricultural water initiative with business for social responsibility bsr that aims among other things to 1 develop supply chain tools that enable corporations to assess monitor and improve water management strategies in their respective supply chains 2 create sustainable water management tools for producers and 3 to create water management indicators and an assessment tool that becomes a widely used industry standard there is more work to be done to address these challenges and we are committed to playing an important role working together with other water users and stakeholders while we are doing what we can to improve our own water conservation practices and to assist with providing drinking water to the communities in which we operate the issue of water conservation in india is much larger than just the coca cola company to successfully address this issue there must be a collaborative effort from leaders in the private sector government and non governmental organizations some of these efforts must improve our knowledge of water challenges and toward that end we have begun working with recognized scientists to address the range of issues facing some of india is key watersheds these evaluations can then inform our efforts to improve water management and work with local communities to improve access to clean water and sanitation forming strong relationships with the right partners will be the key to the success of these efforts and we look forward to reporting on our progress in our 2005 environmental report biosolids food and beverage manufacturing plants that have wastewater treatment systems produce biosolids as part of the wastewater treatment process it is common practice internationally to test the biosolids for safety and if safe to distribute them on land as soil conditioner recent updates on the allegations related to biosolids management include when allegations surfaced that cadmium and lead were present in the company is biosolids we took back the biosolids that had been taken by farmers in kerala and performed an internal evaluation of all of our plants in india to test the biosolids characteristics and to determine the proper method of handling storage and disposal of those materials the company requires that the generation composition and management of biosolids is to be monitored by managers at coca cola bottling plants and biosolids are to be routinely tested to determine appropriate disposal options and to meet internal and local requirements additionally company standards require testing of land application areas prior to and after the distribution of biosolids to ensure no adverse impact on the environment the coca cola company environment water resources department is working with our operations in india and around the world to enable understanding and correct application of the standards a detailed study conducted by the kerala state pollution control board deemed the biosolids produced by our kerala plants to be non hazardous this finding is consistent with internal characterization tests certain regional pollution control boards in india require that biosolids generated by the beverage industry while being classified as non hazardous are to be disposed as hazardous waste in such instances the biosolids are either stored on site as per guidelines provided by local authorities or disposed of at a government approved hazardous waste disposal site the biosolids matter in india is not completely resolved we are working internally and with external stakeholders toward this end we continue to work with our industry associations and the indian government regarding the proper characterization handling and disposal of biosolids and to encourage the development of additional solid waste disposal sites and clear government policies regarding disposal pesticides pesticides are widely used in agriculture in india and can contaminate water sources and agricultural products recent updates on the allegations related to the pesticides issue include we constantly monitor our ingredients and products for quality control and continue to strengthen our processes and procedures to ensure that involuntary contamination by pesticides residues is minimized well below the safety limits the water used to make our products in india meets applicable regulations water used in our products is passed through a multibarrier water treatment system which includes an activated granular carbon filtration and purification process designed to ensure every drop is safe for use in our beverages we test for traces of pesticide residues in water to the level of parts per billion equivalent to one drop in a billion drops other ingredients used in our soft drinks are safe and meet applicable regulations as stated by the minister of health and family welfare and parliamentary affairs in a speech in on august 21 2003 according to the standards prescribed under pfa rules the soft drinks tested are well within the safety limits prescribed for packaged drinking water at present despite the controversies discussed above the coca cola company has recently received awards that recognize our work on environmental stewardship for three consecutive years coca cola plants in india have won the prestigious golden peacock environment management award for environmental practices from the institute of directors which grants the award in association with the world environmental foundation coca cola india has also received recognition from the indian red cross for its environmental programs nevertheless we recognize that our path to sustainable environmental and water management in india is just beginning there is work to do to continuously improve our practices address the challenges facing us and build trust with our partners and other stakeholders as a company we are committed to making that journey environmental governance environmental governance at the coca cola

completion of a detailed assessment of environmental issues impacting 45 bottling facilities owned by the largest bottling partners and helping to significantly increase participation in the environmental performance measurement process working with other business partners suppliers and customers the coca cola system has a large and complex supply chain including more than 5000 manufacturing facilities for directly procured materials such as beverage packaging sweeteners and juices as a customer of these businesses we have an opportunity to integrate good environmental management into these relationships our commercial relationships with suppliers are governed by our supplier guiding principles program which requires compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations the program includes a supplier quality audit process to verify compliance by suppliers with these requirements in 2004 we also launched a formal process of initiating environmental collaboration with key suppliers aimed at building mutual understanding of environmental issues and management approaches mapping the supply related environmental impacts of our environmental governance products identifying best practices and developing joint environmental improvement projects this process is in its early stages during 2004 we reviewed the audit protocol of 20 key suppliers to ensure the appropriate level of attention to environmental issues a number of our large food and beverage retail customers are also active in environmental issues and we have engaged them on how to further environmental collaboration case study europe partnership for progress coca cola hellenic bottling company cchbc one of the company is largest bottling partners worldwide has taken important steps to enhance environmental management providing an example of how the company and its bottling partners can work together to advance the sustainability of the entire coca cola business

report production data this report covers production plants owned by the company and our bottling partners unless otherwise notedoffices laboratories research and development facilities and warehouses are not included data contributed by our bottling partners enable us to offer a more comprehensive picture of the environmental impacts of our business system while we do not have data from all our bottling partners we include estimates of full system impacts based on the data set available data have been collected from the following out of out of facility that manufactures juice concentrates for foodservice out of noncarbonated beverage production facilities out of ccda waters l l c plants out of bottling and canning plants throughout the world most of which are independent businesses in which we may or may not have a stake out of plants worldwide principal beverage concentrate and or syrup manufacturing plants collectively these 765 plants produce 1038 billion liters of nonalcoholic beverage products representing 92 percent of the 2004 end product sales volume of the brands owned by the company along with 100 percent of our global concentrate and syrup production this compares with 685 plants representing 76 percent of 2003 sales volume which were covered in the 2003 environmental report data on fleets and sales equipment due to our complex distribution structure and significant third party ownership of vehiclesdata on our system is transport fleet continues to be difficult to gather the 2004 data on fleet performance represents 50 percent of total system sales volume which we have extrapolated for a systemwide estimate since the operation of sales and marketing equipment vending machines and coolers is generally controlled by our retail customerswe also have limited energy consumption data for this equipment however as indicated in our 2003 environmental report we are able to estimate related environmental impacts using laboratory testing and simulation models our environmental performance and programs performance targets for core operations good stewardship includes setting goals for future performance we have established specific performance targets in each key impact area for all 25 company owned concentrate facilities which represent our core operations the following table shows results against 2004 targets as well as targets set for 2005 beyond the operations directly controlled by the company we are also collaborating with bottling partners to establish performance goals in key areas for independently owned facilities for example we have collected water use goals for 2005 from 554 bottling facilities representing 54 percent of our 2004 sales volume environmental targets and performance of concentrate plants key indicators units water use ratio energy use ratio solid waste ratio recycling grams l liters mj megajoules su standard unit 2 many of our concentrate plants will experience processing changes in 2005 and have anticipated corresponding increases in their solid waste generation ratio goals for example some concentrate plants are in the process of retiring their stock of stainless steel drums in favor of united nations certifi ed containers disposal of those drums will increase the solid waste generation ratio until that process is completed 2 as explained in our 2002 environmental report we measure concentrate and beverage base production by using an internal measure known as a standard unit of concentrate please see endnote our environmental performance and programs water 3 year trend average water use liters of water per liter of product 2004 average water use 272 liters of water per liter of product why it matters water is essential for life and water scarcity is fast becoming one of the world is most pressing global challenges while the amount of water in the world is finite during the past century the world is population has tripled and water use has increased six times a third of the world is population already lives under water stressed condi 2004 estimated systemwide water use 283 billion liters of water tions and it is predicted that this figure will rise to two thirds by 2025 clean water supplies and sanitation remain major problems in many parts of the world with 20 percent of the global population lacking access to safe drinking water lack of clean water contributes to disease food insecurity and the inability to generate income as an important element in the united nations un is strategy for reducing global poverty the un millennium development goals set the target of reducing by half the number of people without access to safe water and sanitation by 2015 although most fresh water is used for agricultural purposes industries do use a significant amount of water water is a shared resource that we need to use responsibly and the private sector has an important role to play water and our business the coca cola company is a hydration company without water we have no business it is the main ingredient in all of our beverages and is itself an important and growing product category as stated in the company is manifesto for growth water is the lifeblood of the coca cola company we have the responsibility and the opportunity to invest in the sustainability of this critical resourceand doing so will produce real benefits for both the company and the wider world in fulfillment of this vision we are committed to accomplishing the following being the most efficient industrial water user among peer companies help to enable access to clean drinking water in underserved communities where we operate support the protection of watersheds in water stressed communities where we operate helping mobilize the international community around water challenges since our business depends on access to water water scarcity is a major risk to the sustainable growth of our business potentially increasing costs and jeopardizing our ability to operate our 2004 annual report on form 10 k lists water quality and quantity as one of our business risks stating that this vital ingredient is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from over exploitationincreasing pollution and poor management our environmental performance and programs today we are transforming the way we as a business think about water we see water as a multidimensional sustainability challenge for both our business and the communities in which we operate and we are addressing the water management in a holistic manner reducing our water consumption through water efficiency programs while partnering with communities to help protect local water resources water use our first responsibility is to be as efficient as possible in our use of water water is not only a vital ingredient in every beverage we produce it is also used in the manufacturing process for purification washing and rinsing bottles and sanitizing machines the water we use comes from various sources such as groundwater wells and surface water including lakes rivers and oceans and publicly and privately owned water supply companies 4 2 water sources for bottling plants in 2004 48 publicly or privately owned water supply companies water usage varies from plant to plant according to various factors including the type of product made and packaging used for example plants that make teas and coffees tend to have higher water use ratios because of the pasteurization process requiredwhile additional water is needed to clean refillable bottles before they can be used again the plants covered in this report used a total of 250 billion liters of water to produce approximately 92 billion liters of product average water use was 272 liters of water per liter of product a 6 percent improvement in performance versus 2003 this improvement was partly due to an increase in the number of plants providing data on this indicator extrapolation to production volumes not directly covered by our report suggests a total water use of approximately 283 billion liters this represents a reduction of 14 billion liters from 2003 we have achieved these gains in close cooperation with our bottling partners by assigning water conservation teams in our plantsemploying new technologies and improving water use and reuse practices in all our manufacturing operations wastewater effluent like most manufacturing operations our plants generate effluent or wastewater during the production process once it has been used our policy requires that the wastewater be appropriately treated before it is discharged back into the natural environment consistent with applicable law and at least to a level capable of supporting fish life where municipal or other external treatment facilities are not able to meet this standard the company requires the construction and use of effluent treatment systems on site routine laboratory tests are required to demonstrate that water treated on site complies with our standards before being discharged to demonstrate the effectiveness of our wastewater treatment we maintain fish habitats ponds and aquariums filled with our treated effluent at more than 188 plants around the world in some cases we also reuse treated effluent for irrigation or to wash trucks as of the end of 2004 approximately 81 percent of our system is facilities met our effluent standard up from 78 percent in 2003 and we are working to achieve 100 percent implementation of wastewater treatment standards by 2010 our environmental performance and programs the coca cola global water initiative recognizing the critical nature of water to our business we launched the coca cola global water initiative in 2004 a collaborative project between the company and our bottling partners to establish a clear road map for the coca cola system on water resource management as a first step in 2004 we initiated a comprehensive global water risk assessment a detailed study of water issues at localnational and global levels to help us build a clear understanding of the water risks facing our business and communities where we operate the project required close collaboration at numerous levels of our business and input from many external sourcesincluding external water studies industry benchmark information and feedback from various stakeholder groups the global water risk assessment included the following a scarcity snapshot a map of water availability at the sub national level using a geographic information system overlaid with the locations of all our plants worldwide showing the relative production volume and water use ratio for each facility comprehensive surveys of each operation focusing on the following water sources management and quality wastewater treatment and community watershed issues including seasonal fluctuations in water availability and the percentage of people with access to clean water and sanitation the data are being used to create detailed risk profiles for each level of our business organization potential risks fall into six main categories watershed sustainability and quality of water resources for the region supply reliability institutional capacity to provide water to industrial agricultural and domestic users efficiency ability to maximize the available water resources in meeting the needs of all users compliance compliance with company and external standards and regulations supply economics direct costs of water including municipal water costs fees taxes treatment

many parts of vietnam more than 40 percent of the rural population does not have access to a safe drinking water supply moreover water is often polluted by poor environmental conditions in 2004 the coca cola company partnered with the united nations development programme to launch the clean water for communities initiative the partners use technical expertise and funding to leverage local knowledge in developing sustainable solutions that meet the unique water needs of individual communities in its first year the project provided water tanks to 180 needy households in one province and additional water facilities to local schools and clinics in five other provinces benefiting thousands of local people our environmental performance and programs case study asia rebuilding water and sanitation systems responding within hours of the devastating indian ocean tsunami in december 2004 our system provided assistance in many forms to the affected areas of indonesia sri lanka thailand the maldives and india including the provision of drinking water trucks and employee volunteers total assistance from the system was nearly 20 million including a 10 million financial commitment from the coca cola company an additional 73 million from bottling partners and employees and 25 million of in kind donations mindful of the disaster is impact on basic community infrastructure the company earmarked 1 million out of its 10 million financial contribution for medium to long term water programs focused on the rehabilitation and sustainable future development of water and sanitation for affected communities by partnering with the united nations foundation and related un agencies and through matched contributions and employee donations this 1 million contribution was increased to a total investment of 2 million to support long term water programs across affected countries case study united states freshwater biodiversity since the 1600s the vast majority of species extinctions in the united states have occurred in rivers and streams throughout the southeast globally lakes rivers streams and wetlands experience extinction rates five times higher than in terrestrial habitats despite this threat freshwater systems have received little conservation attention in response to this gap in 2004 the coca cola company announced a three year 205 million grant in support of the world wildlife fund is wwf is freshwater conservation program the grant will fund wwf is work to restore five critical freshwater systems in the united states including a key network of rivers and streams in the southeast the grant will also be used to fund a global freshwater mapping project incorporating data from scientists around the world when complete the groundbreaking project will be the most comprehensive synthesis of freshwater biodiversity data available our company has supported wwf is work in the southeast united states in a variety of ways in one example we partnered with organizations such as wwf the corps of engineers the cahaba river society the nature conservancy and others to remove a small dam on the cahaba river in alabama known as the marvel slab the dam was built as a logging bridge in the 1960s the only dam on the 190 mile river it acted as a barrier between populations of fish mussels and snails with the dam is removal in october of 2004 the cahaba is now the longest free flowing river in alabama and one of a handful in the entire southeast the success of this project encouraged the corps of engineers to partner with other groups on the removal of two dams on the chattahoochee river on the border of alabama and georgia preliminary studies are complete and in september 2004 local stakeholders purchased the eagles phenix dams a critical step in the process dam removal could occur as early as the fall of 2005 our environmental performance and programs case study india water stewardship the indian monsoon brings most of the year is rainfall within just a few months these seasonal fluctuations can cause significant stress on water systems local communities and other users of water in the area rainwater harvesting accelerates the recharge of this rainwater back into the underground aquifer the water would otherwise run off the dry ground into the rivers and subsequently the oceans far from areas where it is most needed in addition to establishing rainwater harvesting structures in almost all of our plants in india the company has initiated partnerships to set up local rainwater harvesting projects in communities around the country and to mobilize local residents behind these water conservation efforts the projects combine modern technology with the reinstatement of traditional methods of water management that had fallen into disuse for example in the village of kaladera near jaipur the indigenous tanka system of water collection was replicated from western rajasthan which combined both rooftop and surface water harvesting the construction of recharge shafts in community land to channel collected water to aquifers helps communities toward water sustainability the project also restored a bawadi village pond near jaipur an approximately 400 year old historical and traditional water collection and storage building that had fallen into disrepair and was unusable both the state and federal governments are anxious to revive indigenous systems such as the bawadi as a sustainable way of providing villages with clean water for drinking irrigation and watering livestock our environmental performance and programs energy and climate change 3 year trend average energy use megajoules per liter of product 2004 average energy use megajoules per liter of product 2004 estimated systemwide energy use why it matters billion megajoules of energy energy is used every day to heat homes drive cars and run offices it is also used to power factories and manufacture consumer goods the main source of this energy is the burning of fossil fuels oil coal and gas which emit co2 2004 estimated direct and indirect co2 emissions 55 million metric tons carbon dioxide co2 is a greenhouse gas which means that it contributes to the greenhouse effect of the earth is atmosphere the greenhouse effect which traps heat from the sun and prevents it from escaping back to space is essential to life keeping the planet 34 c 61 f warmer than it would otherwise be however the increased amount of co2 and other greenhouse gases such as hfcs in the atmosphere from human activity is strengthening the greenhouse effect contributing to the earth is surface temperature becoming even warmer global warming which is predicted to continue over the next century may contribute to changes in regional climate patterns including an increase in extreme weather conditions such as droughts flooding and storms climate change is considered to be one of the greatest and most urgent environmental challenges facing the planet it is therefore important to reduce our impact on the greenhouse effect through such means as reducing co2 emissions from energy use through energy efficiency measures and by transitioning to renewable sources of energy that reduce or eliminate co2 emissions energy climate change and our business as indicated in prior reports investigation into our climate change footprint revealed that the three largest components of our system is impact are sales and marketing equipment manufacturing and fleet transport the principal emissions impact of these components is based on their energy consumption as described below manufacturing roughly 95 percent of the energy consumed by our system provides the power for our bottling partners operationsincluding equipment such as boilers chillers and air compressors in many locations these operations also manufacture packagingsuch as polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic blow molding plants in our system use a variety of energy sources depending on specific needs and local conditions see box on page 27 energy consumption ratios are a function of specific manufacturing operations for example because of pasteurization juice manufacturing uses more energy than fountain syrup a variety of local factors such as climate plant size packaging type and use of plastic bottlemolding equipment also affect energy use our environmental performance and programs energy sources used by our bottling plants in 2004 37 electricity 37 in 2004 the plants covered by our reporting consumed 467 billion megajoules mj 1 of energy to produce 889 billion liters of products average energy use was 053 mj per liter of product representing an approximately 2 percent improvement in energy efficiency versus 2003 extrapolation of the energy use ratios to production volumes not directly covered by our data suggests an estimated energy consumption of 54 billion mj in 2004 by our entire business system this represents an approximate reduction in energy use of 1 billion mj compared with energy use in 2003 we estimate that this energy consumption led to direct and indirect emissions of 55 million metric tons of co2 a 35 percent decrease of approximately 200000 metric tons versus 2003 distribution and marketing delivering our products to consumers requires distributing packaged product to warehouses and retailers and operating sales and marketing equipment each of which has energy use and emissions implications as noted in our 2003 environmental report we estimate that greenhouse gas emissions related to sales and marketing equipment were almost three times those from system plants while the emissions from distribution are approximately one half of those generated in system plants as noted above we do not have complete data on these activities but the following discussion provides a broad perspective on the environmental impacts of these activities and describes what steps we are taking to mitigate them sales and marketing equipment as previously noted we estimate that worldwide there are a total of about 9 million coolersvending machines and fountain dispensers carrying the coca cola trademark these three main categories of equipment deliver products at the right temperature for consumption directly to consumers most of these machines keep products cold but some also contain hot products such as ready to drink coffee or tea the potential impact of this equipment on global warming stems from the refrigerants used and the energy electricity consumed in operating them we are working proactively to address both as part of a comprehensive ozone protection strategy launched in 1992 company policy since 1995 has required that we no longer purchase equipment containing or made with chlorofluorocarbons cfcs which are ozone depleting substances since sales and marketing equipment can remain in use for 10 to 20 years some cfc containing equipment is still in the market but we expect it to be completely phased out by 2007 when the montreal protocol was adopted in 1987 hydrofluorocarbons hfcs were considered suitable ozone friendly substitutes for cfcs however hfc 134a is now included in the list of greenhouse gases targeted under the 1997 kyoto protocol addressing global climate a joule is a standard international unit of energy it is equal to the work done to produce the power of one watt for one second a megajoule mj 1 million joules our environmental performance and programs change in june 2000 we announced our intention to move away from hfcs for our new cold drink sales and marketing equipment wherever cost efficient alternatives are commercially available this applies to both refrigerants and insulation foam in additionwe have committed that our equipment will be 40 to 50 percent more energy efficient by 2010 than the equipment in place in 2000 ekofreshment to prepare for this equipment transition the company and our supplier partners launched an ekofreshment research and development program to find commercially viable hfc free refrigeration technologies to date we and our partners have invested more than 30 million in this program more than 10 different technology options were extensively tested and compared on the basis of environmental performance regulatory compliance application capabilities price and operational costs from this research co2 based refrigeration emerged as the safest most reliable and most energy efficient hfc free natural alternative technology adaptable to the full range of equipment used in our system when used in refrigeration co2 has a global warming potential of 1 while hfc 134a has a global warming potential of 1300 initial field tests of equipment using co2 technology were conducted in australia greece japan and spain in the summer of 2004 vending machines and coolers using alternative technologies were placed in venues of the athens 2004 olympic games work has now begun with suppliers to build their capacity for cost effective large scale production of co2 based equipment and with our bottling partners on transitioning steadily to the new system these factors will affect the precise target date for full commercial roll out but we are well on the way to achieving our goal of adopting refrigeration systems that are hfc free work on eliminating hfcs from insulation foam is even more advanced as of june 2005 55 percent of our suppliers have moved to non hfc alternatives and we are no longer certifying new equipment using hfc insulation at the 2004 refrigerants naturally conference we announced our estimate that the combined effect of these measures will be that new equipment purchased by our system in 2010 will emit 700000 fewer tons of greenhouse gases than would otherwise have been emitted by staying with models that existed in 2000 roughly equivalent to taking 150000 cars off the road case study united states odwalla green certificates conventional electricity generation is considered the single largest industrial source of air pollution worldwide 1 one way to reduce the overall environmental impact of electricity generation is for companies to purchase green energy certificates that support renewable energy production in 2004 odwalla inc a wholly owned subsidiary of the coca cola company purchased green energy certificates that will offset more than 600000 kilowatt hours of electricity used by its production facility in dinuba california the certificates were purchased from a local renewable energy certificate provider 3 phases energy services which purchases the certificates from renewable energy generators enabling them to make long term investments in new generation projects this renewable energy is added to the electricity

done so far climate system in an integrated way rajendra shende head of energy and ozonaction branch united nations environment programme fleets transport as noted earlier it is difficult to determine the number of vehicles in our distribution network but we have consistently relied on an estimate of approximately 180000 road transportation is the predominant delivery mode for our finished products although the delivery of concentrate from the coca cola company to our bottling partners depends substantially on marine transport environmental impacts result from exhaust emissions and from maintenance that is usually carried out at system facilities or by third party specialists the system is driven by the need to deliver products to consumers as efficiently as possible minimizing fuel use benefits our cost structure as well as the environment our 2004 fuel economy ratio suggests that on average our system is transportation fleet consumes approximately 105 liters of diesel per kiloliter of product delivered in 2004 we estimate that greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet were approximately 285 million metric tons this represents a reduction in fuel efficiency in 2003 our system is fleet ratio was approximately 7 liters of diesel per kiloliter our estimated greenhouse emissions were 18 million metric tons the increase in gas emissions from 2003 to 2004 is based on numerous factors one factor is the expansion of the data set to include four entries by high fuel consuming fleets with these additional fleets however all of our geographic divisions are represented in 2004 data rather than just 17 out of the 21 organizations in the 2003 data set case study brazil alternative fuel in 2004 the coca cola company and our bottling partners launched an innovative project in brazil to reduce co2 emissions from our fleet of delivery vehicles through the use of alternative fuels our bottling partner in s o paolo companhia de bebidas ipiranga is collaborating with s o paulo university on a brazilian biodiesel project in which a fleet of 140 trucks at its s o paulo plant are running on a fuel that is 5 percent biodiesel made of castor beans and soybeans the test

production waste includes materials such as the following empty ingredient containers such as drums pails jugs secondary packaging frames and cardboard slip sheets that separate and stabilize layers of palletized cans shrink or stretch film and or plastic strapping that holds palletized products together biosolids from water and wastewater treatment plants glass or plastic from damaged bottles wood from damaged pallets ingredient waste such as tea leaves in 2004 the production of 7014 billion liters of products in the plants covered by our reporting yielded 818215 metric tons of solid waste from manufacturing operations on average 1167 grams of solid waste of product was generated for each liter of productrepresenting a 45 percent improvement versus 2003 extrapolation of waste ratios suggests an estimated total generation of industrial solid waste by our business system of 1220 kilotons in 2004 a reduction of approximately 34 kilotons from 2003 our system reused or recycled 76 percent of all solid waste produced in these plants up from 74 percent in 2003 the combination of the improved solid waste ratio and improved industrial recycling suggests that our system contributed 39700 tons less waste for disposal from manufacturing operations in 2004 than in 2003 our environmental performance and programs as with energy consumption the range of solid waste production ratios throughout our system varies according to product and packaging mixes e g tea leaves from tea plants and coffee grounds global primary packaging in 2004 51 plastic bottles nr 14 glass ref 1 plastic bottles ref packaging packaging is a critical part of the network that delivers products to consumers and is an essential feature of public health and modern lifestyle unlike waste generated from manufacturing processes consumer packaging adds value by extending shelf life reducing breakage minimizing transportation and handling costs improving safety and providing important product information and convenience to the consumer packaging is also a key point of differentiation and source of competitive advantage for our brands for that to continue our customers and consumers must have confidence in the environmental integrity of the packages we offer we have a long history of analyzing and minimizing the environmental impact of our consumer packaging and we continue our commitment to this task in comparison to many consumer product companies the composition of packaging materials used by our system is relatively homogeneous pet plastic aluminum glass and corrugated materials make up over 90 percent of the materials we put into the marketplace and even when secondary and transport packaging are included paperboard reusable plastic crates and film our total packaging stream is fairly consistent most of the materials can be recycled and in many markets represent the most widely recovered and reused consumer product packages building a global sustainable packaging strategy recognizing that the most effective solutions for improving the environmental performance of beverage packaging are likely to be based on local strategies that address specific needs and circumstances the company has addressed environmental packaging issues primarily on a market by market basis while numerous advances have been made this approach has limited our ability to effectively share innovations globally or to provide meaningful measures of our total global environmental packaging performance and impact in 2004 the company launched a new initiative to develop a common worldwide framework for managing environmental packaging issues and providing global leadership on sustainable beverage packaging led by an international cross functional working teamwe are examining the financial and environmental impacts of our packages throughout their entire lifecycle from development and design to manufacturing and distribution to customer use and disposal or reuse and establishing mechanisms to better identify and capitalize on sustainable packaging opportunities to grow our business foodservice includes bag in box tanks drums bags for fountain products 2 other includes flexible laminates and cartons our environmental performance and programs smart design environmental integrity in packaging begins with design we systematically integrate environmental criteria into our packaging development and commercialization process to deliver innovations that meet consumer needs while sustaining or improving the environmental performance of a package throughout the entire lifecycle recent eco design efforts have focused primarily on our largest consumer packaging stream pet in europe japan and the united states we are working with industry and regulatory authorities to establish clearer design for recycling guidelines for packaging professionals we also continue to make recycling of our pet plastic bottles easier and more efficient by using recycling friendly caps labels adhesives and colors in addition to improving the environmental performance of existing packaging we are also pursuing more dramatic technological innovations such as renewable plastic resins made from plant starch we also continue to work with foodservice partners to pilot renewable plastic cup technology implementing smart design dasani packaging cap use

stronger 20 lighter 14 greater efficiency in production same amount of product resource efficiency our system is efforts to reduce the packaging raw materials and energy inputs required to manufacture and deliver a consumer beverage are persistent and extensive most advances in resource efficiency take place in small incremental steps that often go unnoticed by consumers yet these small steps coupled with the occasional dramatic innovation amount to significant reductions in the environmental and economic impact of our packaging an example of this is the development of a glass design technology called ultra that makes our glass contour bottle 50 percent stronger 20 percent lighter and 10 percent less expensive than earlier models in optimizing the resource efficiency of our primary packaging we are careful to ensure that our quality standards are met or exceeded and that waste is not simply transferred to secondary packaging our environmental performance and programs maximizing reuse perhaps the greatest influence on perceptions of our environmental impact is what happens to our packaging after a beverage is consumed while beverage containers represent only one small part of the broader solid waste and litter challenges facing communities today their visibility ensures they remain at the forefront of discussion this is a challenge we acceptknowing it gives us an opportunity to help advance sustainable solutions to complex environmental problems facing the communities we serve in countries around the world we are actively working to advance public policies and practices designed to encourage greater and more efficient use of local recovery programs differing local market conditions require diverse combinations of recovery practices to achieve the most ecologically and economically sound results a package or material is not recycled until it is used as a raw material to make a new product or service we support recycling initiatives and waste recovery efforts to minimize the environmental impact of packaging after use additionally our system has played a leading role in the development and commercialization of recycled pet plastic technology for bottle to bottle use globally in 1991 the coca cola system along with its supplier was the first in the beverage industry to commercialize a pet beverage container made with post consumer recycled content we continue to lead the industry with our use of recycled resin for bottles in a dozen markets by the end of 2005 we expect to have expanded this number to 17 markets around the world even in markets with excellent recovery and reuse infrastructures the issue of litter often remains whether deliberate or accidentalall forms of litter newspapers car tires fishing debris beverage containers etc can negatively impact local ecosystems economiesand public health and safety effective litter abatement programs include education collection efforts proper local recycling and litter collection bins and enforcement of local ordinances our system supports numerous litter education and prevention organizations around the world such as keep america beautiful japan love the earth cleanup and collect a can in south africa we are also a major sponsor of the ocean conservancy is international coastal cleanup the world is largest annual one day volunteer event to protect clean waterways case study japan recycling center in japan one of the world is most sophisticated consumer markets vending machines are a highly popular way of purchasing both hot and cold beverages approximately 980000 vending machines across the country sell products of the coca cola company in the 1970s coca cola pioneered the industry practice of placing collection boxes next to vending machines and actively encouraging consumers to use them through advertising and education campaigns in 2003 coca cola west japan introduced the latest in a long line of innovations designed to encourage consumer recycling in the country a recycling center in the kita kyusyu eco town where used packaging taken from the collection boxes is processed and prepared for shipment to material recyclers the system supports the recycling industry by reducing their costs up to 40 tons a day 10000 tons a year of plastic bottles aluminum and steel cans and other packaging can be sorted and compressed and sent on to recyclers during 2004 8400 tons of packaging were processed by the center our environmental performance and programs stakeholder leadership our system supports a wide array of initiatives around the world aimed at advancing our understanding of environmental packaging issues and fostering innovative solutions through constructive dialogue through these initiatives we support comprehensive cost effective solutions to local solid waste management issues that include the entire packaging supply chain and broader municipal solid waste stream examples of those initiatives include the following europen the main pan european organization dedicated to issues concerning packaging and the environment with membership open to all partners in the packaging chain beverage industry environment council industry association focused on creating sustainable solutions for beverage packaging in australia beverage packaging environment council consortium of leading beverage companies focused on increasing the recovery of beverage containers in north america case study australia public place recycling in 1991 coca cola amatil cca our bottler in australia was the first company in the world to package beverages in pet plastic bottles using food grade recycled content since then recycling has grown dramatically with neighborhood collection systems in australia now taking in more than 665000 tons of material each year cca estimates that this represents more than 70 percent of packaging from beverages consumed at home with the success of packaging recovery over the past 10 years cca will turn its focus over the next five years to increasing public place recycling ppr the recovery and recycling of material from public places approximately half of all beverages in australia are consumed away from home with very little currently being collected for reprocessing cca is committed to recovering beverage packaging disposed of in public places and removing it from the general waste stream as a first step in 2004 cca launched partnerships with 50 local councils a number of popular public venues and food retail outletsand the beverage industry environment council biec to set up and run public place recycling trial programs in selected areas around the country cca is a founding member of biec which conducts anti litter and recycling

party verification of environmental data and claims presented in its 2004 environmental report the report key objectives of the verification included reviewing the accuracy of the environmental information reported and effectiveness of data collection collation and validation systems the scope of the verification work this year did not include reviewing the effectiveness of new initiatives or management controls of the company and its bottlers which were assessed last year responsibilities of directors and verifiers the information contained in the coca cola company 2004 environmental report is the sole responsibility of the company this verification statement represents the independent opinion of ursvl the ursvl project team members have not been involved in the development of the report or associated environmental programs data and information collection systems verification method ursvl environmental auditors conducted the verification process following the general principles of environmental auditing and audit procedures as contained within the international standard iso 19011 we have based our approach on certain principles of the global reporting initiative and the aa1000 assurance framework the ursvl process has involved reviewing the report to identify information in the data and text that constitute claims or assertions made by the company reviewing the supporting evidence to determine how accurate and appropriate each identified claim or assertion is reviewing data management processes and validation mechanisms for environmental performance data to assess how robust they are and assess the potential for errors within the 2004 data set interviewing by telephone five individuals from the corporate environmental and communication teams to identify changes to environmental arrangements and discuss the reporting process and interviewing by telephone the individuals responsible for data collection and validation within two of the five strategic business units sbus africa and asia final verification statement opinion report context it is encouraging to note that the company continues its commitment to improving environmental performance as well as engaging and encouraging the assistance of its bottlers in this respect the company has continued to formalise its environmental governance programs we understand this has helped to deliver many initiatives and positive outcomes discussed in the report it is also clear that there have been a number of new strategic initiatives in relation to performance and reporting in relation to suggestions made by ursvl last year associated with the reporting processes the company has implemented a new level of structural responsibility for environmental performance measurement epm data collection and validation and included targets for some key environmental performance metrics in this report report data overall the data collection and collation processes are considered to be generally effective and when aggregated provide data which is expected to be representative of performance at company level as a result of clear corporate commitment and sbu engagement there have been significant increases in participation in the epm data collection processes from the system coca cola is bottlers this has reduced the level of data extrapolation and therefore provides greater certainty of the overall system environmental impact the involvement of the sbus in the data collection process is an important development we note that those involved in this new initiative have a strong commitment to improving the integrity of the data collation and validation processes although too early to show improvements for the 2004 data set there is potential for improvements in the accuracy future data sets some minor data collation issues were identified but are not believed to affect the reported data reducing the complexity of the data aggregation process may assist in preventing errors and streamlining the data collection program in future furthermoredocumented guidance of the aggregation methodology may aid the robustness and assist in the validation of data report text in ursvl is opinion the text presented in this report reflects the company is significant environmental impacts and covers key significant initiatives associated with environmental management and performance the report focuses on positive areas of the company is performance although there are references to some of the environmental challenges encountered during the reporting year ursvl has reviewed supporting evidence and considers that the majority of claims made in the main sections of the report are presented in a manner that reflects the evidence in an accurate and balanced manner with respect to the discussions relating to the activities and impacts in india there is strong evidence to support coca cola is position as stated in the report however the situation is complex and there remains some level of uncertainty as some of the regulatory and stakeholder issues are in the process of being resolved the level of supporting evidence was generally lower for case study information in addition in a number of cases where evidence has been assessed by ursvl it has been insufficient to enable the required level of assurance for complete verification final verification statement suggestions for improvements based on the above opinion and scope of work the following suggestions should enable continued improvement in the company is environmental reporting streamline and document the data aggregation process to increase robustness consider further how the report text and associated evidence can be managed and controlled to increase the efficiency of the reporting process and level of validation continue to work with the sbus to address the challenges that have been identified during this year is data collection process provide a more even balance between positive achievements with challenges faced during the year continue to develop stakeholder engagement processes david westwood director for and on behalf of urs verification ltd london

upcoming corporate responsibility review jeff seabright vice president environment water resources june 2006 scope of report to the world at large coca cola is coca cola we recognize that most people do not distinguish between the coca cola company a global corporation and coca cola bottling companies that presents our company with a unique challenge as we manage the environmental impact of our business the coca cola company does not own or manage most bottling companies nor do we have the legal right to control their environmental practices or to require them to report on such practices although our system the coca cola company and our bottling partners is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective we make every effort to positively influence environmental activities and policies throughout our system this report contains bottling partner data and data from company owned plants systemwide information is estimated based on our data and data supplied to us by our bottling partners charts and graphs depict average ratios for participating plants as well as estimated total system data unless otherwise noted performance data in the body of the report refers to average ratios for participating plants production data data has been collected representing 700 bottle can plants eight noncarbonated beverage production facilities and 33 principal beverage concentrate and or syrup manufacturing plants in total our data covers 741 plants the 185 billion unit case volume covered by these plants represents 90 percent of the system is 2005 unit case volume this compares with 765 plants and 92 percent of unit case volume covered by the 2004 report unless otherwise noted officeslaboratories research and development facilities and warehouses are not included fleet data given our complex distribution structure and considerable third party ownership of vehicles data on our system is transport fleet remains difficult to obtain the 2005 data represents 43 percent of total system unit case volume which we have used to calculate a systemwide estimate average plant ratios based on collected data and systemwide totals based on estimated total use may be found on pages 6 to 9 performance data specific to company owned concentrate plants may be found on page 10 sales and marketing equipment data the vending machines and coolers owned by the coca cola system are placed on the premises of our retail customers as a result we have limited data on actual energy consumption and therefore estimate related environmental impact using laboratory testing and simulation models 2005 environmental performance tracking across the coca cola system improvement in water use ratiobased on the average across the plants supplying data improvement in solid waste ratiobased on the average across the plants supplying data our operations the environmental impact of our business occurs within plant operations distribution networks and from sales and marketing equipment we have more than 300 bottling partners globally because much of the environmental impact of our business occurs beyond company owned facilities we work closely with our bottling partners to improve our system is overall performance we take a systemwide view of our environmental impact and collectively develop strategies and share best practices the coca cola environmental council includes senior environmental managers from the company our company owned bottling plants and six of our largest bottling partnerswho together own and operate more than 200 production facilities representing approximately 47 percent of global unit case volume the six bottling partners are coca cola enterprisescoca cola femsa coca cola hellenic bottling company sabmiller coca cola amatil and coca cola west japan the operations of these bottling partners cover significant portions of north america europe and eurasia latin america africa australia and japan our primary challenges three principal environmental challenges demand our attention because they are where our business has the greatest impact 1 water 2 packaging and 3 energy and climate protection we set performance targets for our core operations the 25 company owned concentrate facilities in the areas of water energy and climate as well as solid waste and recycling our tracking systems the coca cola quality system tccqs is our quality management system integrating our approach to managing quality the environment and health and safety through continuous improvementour system strives to meet the most stringent up to date global requirements governing food safetyas well as quality management standards the environmental component of tccqs known as the ekosystem reflects the international environmental management system standard iso 14001while including additional requirements tailored to our business we also work with bottling partners to set performance goals in facilities where we do not have operational control individual production facilities develop programs to identify key environmental impact and establish processes for ensuring compliance with these standards our environmentoccupational safety and health eosh audit program assesses company owned production facilities shares audit findings with management and implements and tracks corrective action eosh performance is reported to the audit committee of the board of directors improvement in recycling ratebased on the average across the plants supplying data we continue to evolve our audit process to provide for eosh and system improvement and governance as a result we are implementing a new stewardship auditing organization that will integrate eosh auditing with quality auditing it will extend eosh auditing to both companyand bottler owned facilities we aim to have a baseline eosh audit completed for these bottler production facilities by the end of 2007 improvement in energy use ratiobased on the average across the plants supplying data performance data for the coca cola system average plant ratios based on collected data water in 2005 we improved our water efficiency by 4 percent while our water use efficiency has improved significantly over the three years we have reported it we project that it may level off changes in our product mix namely the growth in coffee and tea products could make our production operations more water intensive water use ratio liters liter of product in 2005 we completed comprehensive risk assessments of water risks facing our system and our host communities at 811 bottling plants and continued to improve the efficiency with which we use water we continue to work with our bottling partners worldwide to implement and enhance effective wastewater treatment and conservation processes to achieve compliance with our own strict standards which often exceed applicable laws in 2005 we stood at 81 percent compliance with the requirement for an on site effluent treatment facility in bottling plants our goal remains 100 percent compliance by 2010 but we are focused on more than just water efficiency reaching beyond our own environmental responsibilities to create solutions to help address the global challenge of water scarcity by the end of 2005 we had established approximately 20 community and watershed partnerships with local and international bodies to help provide access to potable water and sanitation in communities around the world where we operate systemwide total based on estimated total use water use total billion liters last year we also helped develop a new global multi stakeholder platform partnering with the emory global center for safe water millennium water alliance the united nations foundation unicefthe united states centers for disease control and prevention the wallace genetic foundation and aluminum packaging our beverages are enjoyed more than 13 billion times a day to satisfy this thirst we depend on packaging for containing distributing protecting and marketing our products to consumers by working to continuously enhance the environmental and social value of packaging from design to end use we are committed to responsibly meeting these needs today and in the future in 2005 we made meaningful progress toward sustainable packaging excellence we continued to enhance the efficiency of our packaging by reducing raw material usage or lightweighting aluminum cans 12oz 355ml glass contour bottles 8oz and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles 2l used today

is focused on providing water and sanitation to many schools in kenya is nyanza province we are already seeing great potential for replication of this program elsewhere the majority of our primary packaging is returnablebulk or made from commonly recycled materials we slightly expanded our use of bio based plastics to further assess effective strategies for responsibly managing this material over its life in 2005 our use of cutting edge ultra glass technology eliminated the need for approximately 52000 tons of glass globally a co2 reduction equivalent to planting 8000 acres of trees we also reduced global pet use by more than 10000 tons through manufacturing and package redesign efforts recycling rates for beverage containers remain among the highest of any consumer products packaging in the world and we work to help further increase these rates by using materials compatible with recycling systems and supporting projects that encourage greater and more efficient recycling examples include cempre in brazil which promotes collection and creates jobs prs in switzerland a national packaging recovery organization recylebank in the united states a consumer incentive and education program and coca cola owned recycling centers such as the kitakyushu sawayaka facility of coca cola west japan given the increasing demand for non returnable packages a significant amount of our attention environmentally is on increasing closed loop recycling opportunities for these containers since introducing the first ever beverage container with recycled pet in 1991 we have invested

information about any of these programs please visit www coca cola com we maintain one of the largest refillable glass and pet packaging floats in the world delivering approximately 21 percent of our global unit case volume in addition a third of our volume in the united states is delivered through bulk package systems such as returnable steel tanks or bag in box containers for fountain syrup solid waste and recycling we are committed to effective long term waste management and minimizing waste generation in our facilities the vast majority approximately 98 percent of solid waste from our system is generated during the bottling process and includes materials such as empty ingredient containers secondary packaging film and or plastic wrap that holds pallets together biosolids from water and wastewater treatment plants glass or plastic from damaged bottles wood from pallets and ingredient waste such as tea leaves we make every effort to reuse or recycle such solid waste and we are committed to continuously working to improve our recycling rates in our facilities average plant ratios based on collected data energy use ratio equivalent to gigajoules ton of production based on 2005 figure of 0497 and 2004 figure of 0525 note we estimate that our 2005 energy consumption led to direct and indirect emissions of 448 million metric tons of co2 a decrease of approximately 024

refrigeration technology advanced steadily in 2005 approximately 4000 co2 refrigerated coolers and vending machines representing a new breakthrough in refrigeration technology are now in the marketplace creating demand for other such coolers with peer companies and transforming the environmental impact from coolers little by little we plan to progress gradually introducing between 3000 and 5000 units per year in our operations to validate reliability targets verify service and support processes and prepare for systemwide conversion in addition we are introducing energy management solutions in new equipment by 2010our cold drink equipment should be 40 to 50 percent more energy efficient than it was 10 years prior reducing co2 by 700000 tons annually this is equivalent to removing 150000 cars from the road in 2005 the united nations commission of sustainable development recognized refrigerants naturally the industry alliance we cofounded with mcdonald is and unileveras a public private partnership for sustainable development energy use total billion megajoules in 2005 manufacturing operations covered by our reporting generated 905652 metric tons of solid waste on average for each liter of product 1127 grams of solid waste was generateda 3 percent improvement compared to 2004 extrapolation of waste ratios suggests an estimated total generation of industrial solid waste by our system of 1192 kilotons in 2005 a reduction of approximately 2 percent compared to 2004 we reused or recycled 78 percent of all solid waste produced in these plants up from 76 percent in 2004 the improvements in our solid waste and recycling ratios suggest that our system generated 33 kilotons less waste for disposal from manufacturing operations in 2005 than in 2004 performance targets for concentrate plants we have established specific performance targets for all 25 company owned concentrate plantswhich represent our core operations the following table shows

involved reviewing the report to identify information in the data and text that constitute claims or assertions made by the company reviewing the supporting evidence to determine how accurate and appropriate each identified claim or assertion is reviewing data management processes and validation mechanisms for environmental performance data to assess how robust they are and to assess the potential for errors within the 2005 data set interviewing by telephone ten individuals from the corporate environmental and communication teams to review the scope and implementation of environmental policies and associated programs as well as the reporting process and interviewing by telephone the individuals responsible for data collection and validation within three of the six operating groups european union latin america and east south asia and pacific rim opinion environmental policies and programs the coca cola company continues to see environmental issues as an important part of its core business strategy as demonstrated in its manifesto for growth 11 during 2005 strategies for sustainable packaging and energy and climate protection have been developed and rolled out these alongside the existing strategy for water provide a clear vision of how the company seeks to manage and reduce its direct and indirect impacts in these areas the main activities in 2005 associated with these strategies have included the development and piloting of tools capacity building through training and delivery of some key initiatives overall the delivery of these strategies is in its early stages and their continued implementation should lead to improvements in environmental performance for both the company and its bottling partners accuracy overall the information and data presented is considered to reflect actual performance and achievements for the company and its bottling partners during 2005 we have reviewed evidence for the majority of claims made in the report and found that generally this evidence supports the claims made for those where evidence provided has not fully supported the claim ursvl has some awareness of the program or initiative discussed and has no reason to believe that the claim does not reflect performance the environmental performance reporting system for data associated with company owned sites and those of their bottling partners is effective generating data which when aggregated at a corporate level is generally accurate in early 2005environmental co coordinators were established at the operating group level with specific responsibility for collation and validation of environmental performance data at a regional level this has led to greater local ownership and increased validation of the environmental performance data however there continues to be minor inefficiencies in the processes used for the collection and management of data at a corporate level although these have not resulted in significant variances in the data reported there have been changes in the environment and water resource team structure and responsibilities for the report and associated validation processes both before and during the reporting process although these changes have led to inefficiencies in the reporting process these are not considered to have impacted materially on the information disclosed balance and completeness the coca cola company has designed this report to be a scorecard of certain aspects of performance which will be supported by greater disclosure of environmental programs initiatives and issues on its website the reporting of performance focuses on the key areas that the company has identified as primary challenges water packaging and energy and climate protection and also waste management within this scope the report provides a fair reflection of environmental performance during 2005 suggestions for improvements based on the above opinion and scope of work the following suggestions should enable continued improvement in the coca cola company is environmental reporting continue to embed strategies developed in 2005 at all levels of the business broaden the scope of reporting to include targets beyond company owned concentrate manufacturing facilities continue to encourage regional ownership of environmental performance data and targets to enhance data qualityincluding validation and continue to pursue opportunities to improve the existing data collation system david westwood director for and on behalf of urs verification ltd london june 2006 12 environmental statement a healthy environment locally and globally is vital to our business we view protection of the environment as a journey not a destination we began that journey over 100 years ago and it continues today each

community at a time we must help create economic and social value protect the environment and contribute to the long term sustainability of every community we serve e neville isdell chairman and chief executive officer we like to say that magic is one of the secret ingredients in our beverages i believe a big part of that magic has always been the spirit of optimism and hope that has shaped our company since the first glass of coca cola was poured 121 years ago today is world is very different from what it was in 1886 optimism and hope are more important than ever and increasingly harder to find our role in this changing challenging world can be captured in a single sentence we must refresh the world responsibly through the years responsibility has been framed in terms of citizenship and philanthropy and certainlyboth of these are important but it is time to raise our expectations and work toward the sustainability of our communities what does this have to do with creating and selling consumer products today everything recently i spoke at the united nations global compact leaders summit about my thoughts on business as an agent of global transformation i challenged the business leaders in the audience to speak up step up and scale up to leverage our combined efforts through concerted coordinated and cooperative global action the urgency of this message stems from my experiences each time i travel around the world each time i talk to people in local markets i become more convinced that the time to take meaningful action is growing short 2 the coca cola company we have one planet and many parts of it are under stress from population growth shrinking supplies of clean water climate change and conflict meaningful change in addressing these global issues requires collaboration and commitment our impact is magnified when we work with others our bottling partners suppliers other businesseslocal communities governments and nongovernmental organizations ngos because the coca cola company is a local business on a global scale the issues that challenge the sustainability of communities in the more than 200 countries we serve also challenge the sustainability of our business our business cannot hope to thrive long term unless our consumers do we cannot hope to prosper unless our associates and communities do this report cites many examples of that belief in action and we believe no issue is more important or urgent than access to clean safe water for communities around the world that is why in june 2007 we pledged to replace every drop of water we use in our beverages and their production this goal is admittedly aspirational it will be a multi year journey for our company and our bottling partners we are also focusing on reducing our carbon footprint and increasing the sustainability of our packaging muhtar kent our company is president and chief operating officer discusses some of these initiatives in his message to you we are committed to refreshing the world in bodymind and spirit by anticipating our consumers desires and needs providing great jobs and protecting the workplace rights of all our associates replacing every drop of water we use growing our business but not our carbon footprint designing packaging that will be seen as a valuable resource for future use helping to improve the well being of the people

contributes to the well being of communities through economic development from the truck driver who delivers our beverages to the retailer who sells them we support local economies a study conducted in south africa demonstrated that for every job created by the coca cola systeman additional 16 jobs are created indirectly i have a deep and personal belief about our responsibilities to the communities and people we serve this company has been a major part of my life for more than 40 years and i think a lot about the mark the coca cola company will leave on the world to use our strengths and our presence to help protect the health of our planet and to improve the lives of the people who inhabit it no company can aspire to have that kind of impact by working or thinking alone change is a group effort crossing governments ngos individuals and businesses working together is the only way that we can create solutions equal to the issues we all face for all the complexity of finding solutions to these issues the basic idea is simple imagine what could happen if every organization every community every individual simply did what is right for the planet and for all who share it

to what we use in all our beverages and their production our objective is to advance a packaging framework in which our packaging is no longer seen as waste but instead as a valuable resource for future use we are working to grow our businessbut not the carbon emissions of our manufacturing operations the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents water stewardship workplace marketplace environment community in 2007 we used approximately 300 billion liters of water in our plants to produce beverages to meet our water needs while helping to conserve watersheds and improve community water access water stewardship leads the list of our sustainability efforts in 2007 we announced our aspirational goal to return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our beverages and their production we call this water neutrality we are moving toward our goal with three objectives reduce the amount of water used to produce our beverages recycle water used in our manufacturing processes so it can be returned safely to the environment replenish water in communities and nature through a global network of local partnerships and projects increasingly plants throughout our system are replacing rinsing of our beverage packages with ionized air instead of water to further reduce the water used in our manufacturing process and increase our overall water efficiency while we do not yet have a date for when we hope to attain water neutrality as a companywe are participating in a broad international dialogue that will help us establish a system to measure our progress water use total water use ratio efficiency systemwide total based on estimated total use billion liters average plant ratios based on collected data liters liter of

2002 data reduce unit case volume water usage water use ratio efficiency in 2007 our company operations in north america saved 26 billion gallons of water through reduction efforts across all facilities to accelerate our water recycling progress we have streamlined our wastewater system design and implemented an interactiveglobal wastewater operations management program the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review between 2002 and 2007 our unit case volume increased by more than 21 percent while our global water consumption decreased by more than two percent we are producing more beverages with less water our 2007 systemwide water use efficiency was 247 liters per liter of product this means that we used 247 liters of water to produce each liter of our beverages one liter goes into the beverage itself and the remaining 147 liters are used for manufacturing processes such as rinsing cleaning and cooling systemwide this marks a two percent improvement over 2006 we know we must and will do more to improve we took a step forward in 2007 by forming a multi year partnership with world wildlife fund wwf working with wwf we have created a toolkit to help our bottling partners understand how their water use tracks with best practices within our business system based on that knowledge we share numerous facility specific ways to continue to improve water use efficiency we will announce global targets in 2008 for continued water use efficiency improvements through 2012 recycle all the water we return to the environment from our manufacturing operations typically called wastewater is required to meet applicable laws and regulations we also have an internal standard that our operations must ensure treatment of water so that it is capable of supporting aquatic life before returning it to the environment in some communities howeverwastewater treatment does not exist or does not meet a standard that protects the aquatic environment in these cases we have asked our bottling partners to build their own treatment systems on site this is an expensive and time consuming undertaking often cleaning water so it can be discharged into an already polluted waterway but we believe alignment with our global standard is critical to help preserve local water resources and demonstrate how business can be a leader in setting standards that help protect communities and nature our goal is to have 100 percent of our facilities aligned with our stringent internal wastewater standards by the end of 2010 in 2007 85 percent of company and bottling partners met our standards as we progress toward water neutrality actions to align our system with our wastewater standards address nearly 60 percent of our total water use approximately 178 billion liters of the water we used in 2007 environment contents systemwide we have set a goal to offset the liters of water used in our finished beverages approximately 122 billion liters in 2007 through locally relevant projects that support communities and nature we are currently involved in more than 120 community water projects in more than 50 countries these projects which help protect and conserve water resources and improve access to clean water and sanitation are conducted in partnership with a wide range of organizationsincluding the u s agency for international development usaid care the united

the world contains enough water to meet personal agricultural and business needs we know however that we all must improve the management of what we have our company is working to more fully understand vulnerabilities to water sources we use while also measuring and communicating the impact of our business on water and communities we will continue to consider water resources when planning new manufacturing sitesdeciding on plant closings making acquisitions or expanding production at existing plants we are working with the nature conservancy to review our current community water initiatives and develop methodologies for quantifying their impact we also are involved with the water footprint working group to develop standards and guidelines for water footprint accounting and to define the concept of water neutrality this work complements our engagement with the ceo water mandate see page 38 a joint initiative of the united nations global compact and the government of sweden the ceo water mandate seeks to build an international movement of committed companies working to develop strategies and solutions to help address the water challenges facing the world today reflects the total investment by the coca cola system and our program partners the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review this year we revised our standard for source water protection which outlines a comprehensive evaluation process including source mapping source vulnerability assessments and development and implementation of source water protection plans each plant in our global system is expected to have a source water protection plan in place by 2013 given the accelerating impacts of climate change population growth and urbanization we expect water scarcity to be a growing risk factor for our business we recognize an increased responsibility when our facilities are operating in areas of the world experiencing water scarcity or drought we have issued water scarcity guidelines to our global system to help manage operations faced with short or mid term scarcity environment contents ceo water mandate workplace marketplace environment community the ceo water mandate represents

global development alliance is alliance of the year award one of the projects includes building infrastructure to provide better access to water and sanitation for schools in guatemala as shown above we believe that we can play a powerful role in helping to advance key public policy issues related to our business by using our company voice in may 2008 we signed a letter in conjunction with several signatories of the ceo water mandate urging the leaders of the group of eight g8 countries in advance of the annual summit in july 2008 to achieve the commitments of the un millennium development goals the letter called on the leaders of the g8 to live up to government is responsibility and commitments to make the emerging water crisis a global priority the letter also stated that we see water as not just an environmental issue but as a poverty and development issue an economic issue and therefore a business issue additionally our government relations department has lobbied for increased funding of the water for the poor act with the u s congress community engagement on a local level we are partnering with the environmental law institute eli to build the capacity of our company is staff and bottling partners to more effectively engage with community stakeholders in their water resource management activities specificallythe project partners are creating tailored written materials and conducting a series of capacity building workshops to provide comprehensive training on stakeholder engagement in water resources management we realize the need for collective action in communities and plan to roll out the workshops globally in the years to come the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents sustainable packaging workplace in 2007 approximately 98 of our global unit case volume was delivered in refillable recyclable or bulk primary packaging systems marketplace environment community to bring our portfolio of beverages to consumers each day we depend on packaging whether a juice drink sports drink tea or sparkling beverage some form of packaging is required to deliver our beverage products from where they are produced to consumers from an environmental perspective a well designed package actually helps to prevent waste by reducing breakage maintaining product quality and meeting functional needs of consumers however packaging can also have significant environmental impacts related to natural resource consumption and waste disposal our vision is to advance a packaging framework in which our packaging is no longer seen as waste but instead as a valuable resource for future use to realize this zero waste vision we are guided by a commitment to continuous improvement in 2007 we continued to make strides by advancing packaging initiatives focused on three goals reduce to design consumer preferred packages that use the least amount of resourceswhile maintaining product quality recover to build packaging management systems to collect post consumer packaging reuse to use post consumer packaging and packaging materials again to deliver sustainable value we are in the process of setting specific global targets in addition to local targets in all three areas and will report progress on them in future sustainability reports and on our website 2007 global packaging 2007 united states packaging based on 227 billion unit case volume based on 54 billion unit case volume pet refillable other the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents reduce we aim to be the most efficient user of consumer preferred packaging in the beverage industry this begins in our package development stage where we work to use the least amount of natural resources necessary to protect product quality and meet consumer needs one of the ways we conserve natural resources is by lightweighting taking weight and material out of our packaging our packaging innovation teams are continually testing packages and looking for new ways to decrease our raw material use while also reducing costs since their initial introductions we have successfully reduced the weight of our 8 ounce glass bottle by more than 50 percent our 12 ounce aluminum can by more than 30 percentand our 20 ounce pet bottle by 25 percent throughout our system we tailor our packaging to meet local economicsocial and environmental needs in least developed markets we rely more heavily on refillable bottles in order to offer greater affordability to consumers and prevent waste in other instanceswe adjust the amount of material used in pet bottles based on local temperatures to reduce packaging while maintaining product quality as we reduce the weight of bottles and cans we are particularly careful to avoid simply transferring waste to another part of the packaging chain for example we do not reduce a primary package so much that it requires additional secondary or transport packaging to avoid breakage a key component of our progress has been our system is commitment to measuring and charting performance we continue to enhance tracking of our total packaging use and commission scientific studies known as life cycle assessments lca to evaluate packaging options for our total impact on the environment these packaging performance tools help us identify opportunities for improvement and align resources against those opportunities with the greatest potential for fulfilling our long term goals our 2007 lightweighting progress less pet in 600 ml bottle in mexico while sustaining up to 25 recycled content less pet in 500 ml dasani bottle in the u s with further enhancements planned in 2008 smaller cap for pet bottles eliminating 40 million pounds of plastic annually in the u s alone improved yield from coca coladiet coke and sprite concentrate reducing total packaging for fountain beverages the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents strategic recovery programs snapshot coca cola recycling inc north america an independent subsidiary of coca cola enterprises inc established in partnership with our company in 2007 to increase recycling rates in north america target established to collect 230000 million tons of beverage packaging roughly 30 of our pet bottles and cans by 2010 nonprofit organization co founded by coca cola brazil dedicated to the promotion of recycling that aims to increase community awareness of recycling and other solid waste issues in brazil currently supporting more than 400 recycling cooperatives in brazil altstoff recycling austria ara founded in 1993 altstoff recycling austria is a nonprofit organization that manages cost effective collection and recovery of waste packaging materials across austria another aspect of our package development process is to evaluate the municipal waste and recycling infrastructure in the communities we serve the majority of our packages are 100 percent recyclable and among the most recycled consumer packages in the world as a result of our selection of materials with established economic value that typically justify their collection and reuse however sound design is only as effective as the collection process that brings used packaging back into the recycling loop one of the barriers to recycling in many markets around the world is the weakness of municipal and commercial collection systems for all packaging our system invests millions of dollars annually to support the collection and recovery of beverage packaging materials there is currently no universal recovery model so we work in partnership with local communities around the world to help develop economically and environmentally effective solutions tailored to meet their specific needs in more developed markets this typically means supporting national recovery organizations focused on all packaging or launching our own recycling businesses in emerging marketswhere beverage container recycling rates tend to be higher due to informal collecting we focus our support on programs that improve quality of life for collectors in least developed marketswe predominantly rely on refillable containers that are returned and taken back for reuse petco south africa established in 2004 to promote and improve the waste management and recycling of post consumer pet products in south africa targets are set to recycle 35 of pet bottles by 2010 the japan container and packaging recycling association started in 1996 to help protect the environment in japan and contribute to the domestic

packaging litter abatement supporting litter collection education programs though we have a robust sustainable packaging strategy we face litter issues in the communities we serve all too often our packages are found along roadsides beaches or in waterways while we have worked hard to advance community recycling programs we still know that public education is key to preventing litter our system supports numerous litter prevention and community beautification organizations around the worldincluding keep australia beautiful in australia the tidy britain group in great britain and keep america beautiful in the united states in addition to local partners we have identified global partnersincluding the ocean conservancy and its international coastal cleanup icc an activity that collects removes and tracks millions of pounds of litter and debris from more than 33000 miles of shoreline in 76 countries the data collected is used to study the global waterway debris problem educate the public to change behaviors and find solutions according to the ocean conservancy is data analysis from 2007 beverage containers comprise 159 percent of the total debris collected we have been an active sponsor of icc for 13 years and in 2008 we increased our financial support with a three year 1 million grant from the coca cola foundation in addition to donationsour associates are active participants in the icc in 2007associates across our system company associates bottling partners customers and consumers worked together in 28 countries to provide hands on support for this global initiative the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents reuse highest level of recycled content used in a pet bottle by coca cola 40 60 average recycled content in aluminum cans returning materials and energy from used packaging back to our production process is essential for realizing our long term sustainability aspirations today the worldwide market demand for reusing our core packages is strong our system has helped foster this demand by advancing sustainable technologies that enable greater use of recycled content material in our packages purchasing products made from recycled beverage packaging and enhancing the efficiency of our refillable bottles we were the first company to introduce a beverage bottle made with recycled plastic in 1991 since that time we have led the industry in our global use of recycled content pet and our direct investment in pet bottle to bottle recycling facilities around the world in 2007 we announced our investment of more than 40 million to help build the world is largest plastic bottle to bottle recycling plant expected to be fully operational in 2009the 30 acre facility located in the united states spartanburg south carolina will produce approximately 100 million pounds the equivalent of 2 billion 20 ounce pet bottles of pet plastic for reuse each year we also launched a new line of licensed merchandise in 2007 made from recycled beverage packaging materials see page 31 these innovative products merge trends with environmental consciousness and help remind consumers that small steps like recycling a bottle can make a difference in preserving our environment 19 amount of 2007 unit case volume in refillable packages making us the industry leader packaging challenges preventing packaging waste and minimizing the environmental impact of packaging is a serious challenge beverage packaging is one small part of this issue yet it is routinely the sole focus of attention imposing restrictions obstructs and ignores the real goal of integrated waste prevention a recent example is the call to mandate the use of compostable pet beverage bottles coca cola has been working for more than a decade to responsibly advance the use of bio or plant based plastic materials as with any new package we have been careful to understand the full life cycle environmental impacts of bio based technologies before making them commercial packaging life cycle studies on the use of plant based material for beverage bottles have demonstrated that a compostable bottle does not offer environmental benefits over existing recyclable bottles due to energy and raw material losses despite making this research public calls for compostable bottles continue the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review environment contents energy management and climate protection workplace marketplace environment community we believe that climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on the sustainability of our business our climate protection effort starts inside the company with a combination of action and education in the three areas where we have the biggest climate protection opportunity cold drink equipment improving the efficiency of our coolers vending machines and fountain equipment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions produced by this equipment facilities and bottling plants improving our energy efficiency and productivity and reducing manufacturing emissions transportation managing our distribution fleet to incorporate more fuel efficient modes of product delivery our system intends to purchase and put into service 100000 coolers that use co2 as a refrigerant gas by the end of 2010 the largest deployment of this new technology by anyone in our industry to date our 2007 system greenhouse gas emissions totaled 492 million metric tons a 1 increase over our 2006 emissions of 486 million metric tons while our unit case volume grew 6 from 2006 to 2007 the coca cola company 2007 2008 sustainability review cold drink equipment with climate change most closely associated with burning fossil fuels it surprises many people to learn that our single largest emission of greenhouse gases comes from keeping our beverage products cold our coolers vending machines and fountain equipment impact the environment in three ways energy use insulation foam and refrigerant in the cooling system in 2000 we made a commitment to improve the energy efficiency of our cooling equipment by 40 to 50 percent by 2010 we are well on our way to reaching that goal we developed a proprietary energy management system ems that delivers energy savings of up to 35 percent we have placed 1 million of these units in markets around the world these 1 million units are saving an estimated 11 billion kilowatt hours per year in 2006 we completed the transition to insulation foam that is free of hydrofluorocarbons hfcs in all new refrigeration equipment our new insulation avoids three quarters of the direct greenhouse gas emissions from our old equipment refrigerant gases are a big challenge and an even bigger leadership opportunity the same hfcs that we have taken out of our insulation foam also are the chemical backbone of most of the current generation of cooling equipment and an unusually potent greenhouse gas interestingly our alternative is carbon dioxide co2 which is also a greenhouse gas itself but when used in cooling systems it is 1300 times less potent than the hfc 134a we deploy in our conventional equipment environment contents by the end of 2007 the company and our bottling partners had deployed more than 8500 units of hfc free equipment using co2 as the refrigerant by the end of 2008 we will have deployed approximately 30000 units including approximately 5600 for the beijing olympic games while the new units are a small percentage of our total they can be a step toward a broader industry conversion because co2 equipment is presently more expensive than equipment using hfcs many companies have been slow to make the shift our commitment to purchase 100000 co2 coolers creates an incentive for manufacturers to increase production which will eventually bring down the price accelerating the shift to a new generation of environmentally improved cooling facilities and bottling plants coca cola hellenic bottling company

aimed at preventing waste over the life of our packaging to us waste prevention extends beyond simply reducing packaging material our focus is on eliminating all raw materialenergy and water losses across the entire packaging process chain from the initial resources used to make a package through to the consumer and beyond at the foundation of our strategy is a commitment to measuring

consumer beverage needs with even better environmental performance continues to rise to meet this challenge we are constantly pushing our company and our bottling partners to find innovative ways to improve we are working to completely eliminate the use of nonrenewable fossil fuels in our plastic bottles while maintaining quality and recyclability in 2009 we introduced our breakthrough plantbottle pet package the only recyclable bottle made partially from plant based materials that can meet our stringent beverage quality requirements plantbottle packaging uses sugar based ethanol to produce the same pet plastic used today but with a smaller carbon footprint we are currently investing millions of dollars in plantbottle technology because we believe in the environmental and supply chain benefits it provides to the coca cola system we are confident that the cost will decrease significantly as we advance the technology and the benefits of plantbottle packaging are already adding up in 2010we expect to launch 25 billion packages in nine major markets across europe latin america north america and pacific through this roll out we will eliminate more than 79000 barrels of oil use for our system this year in 2009 we also continued to enhance the sustainability of bottles through our leadership on recycled content technology for nearly two decades the coca cola system has helped advance cutting edge technologies for using recycled plastic back in bottles including investments in six bottle to bottle recycling plants while biodegradable packaging can be a sound choice for products that are not commercially recyclablethe process of capturing the embodied energy and raw materials in beverage bottles for reuse through recycling is in our viewa much better option a one use bottle is simply not a viable option for our business we plan to use plantbottle packaging in every bottle we sell by 2020 sustainable packaging investing in recycling programs our global target is to recover the equivalent of 50 percent of the bottles and cans we sell worldwide annually by 2015 in 2009 our system supported the direct recovery of 36 percent of the bottles and cans we placed into the market to realize our long term sustainability aspirations the recovery of our beverage container materials for reuse is critical we are actively engaged around the world providing leadership and funding to help establish and grow effective recovery systems to ensure the valuable materials used in our packaging are recovered and used again we recognize that a key to driving recovery is ensuring market demand for materials collected is strong we were the first company to use recycled content in beverage packaging and have helped fund six bottle to bottle recycling plants around the world to help drive domestic end markets we also use our trademark to help advance alternative end markets through recycled pet retail merchandise this ensures value for the recycled materials and helps educate consumers on what our packages can become when they are recycled we recognize we will not be successful acting alone we are confident that through collaboration with government and other industry partners we will advance our vision faster and with a larger positive impact we are supporting and advancing product stewardship models around the world although recycling and waste management are very local issues we are advancing industry recovery models that are closely linked with the economic development of a particular market in developing markets we are working with government and industry to transform the current informal collection systems into formal models that drive recovery of material while creating sustainable jobs in developed markets we support extended producer responsibility approaches that include comprehensive recovery of materials through industry recovery organizations vancouver olympic games activation for the 2010 vancouver olympic games we

use locally as such the health of our business is dependent upon the health of the people communities and ecosystems where we operate throughout the coca cola system we are intensely focused on water stewardship we focus our water stewardship efforts in three areas improve our water efficiency recycle the water used in our operations wastewater treatment and replenish1 through community water access and watershed restoration and protection all of these efforts are linked to our commitment to the sustainability of the water resources we share in 2009 the coca cola system achieved its seventh consecutive year of improved water use efficiency across the system 309 billion liters of water were used to manufacture 130 billion liters of product with a water use ratio of 236 liters per liter of product produced a 13 percent reduction since 2004 this represents a single year efficiency improvement of 29 percent from 2008 to 2009 the coca cola system has pledged to improve its water use ratio 20 percent by 2012 compared with a 2004 baseline and we are on track to meet this goal this goal also is a key part of our global partnership with wwf since 2004 we have achieved an average

the water we use in our operations our goal is to return all the water used in our manufacturing processes throughout our system to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life by the end of 2010 water used in coca cola system operations is recycled through a stringent treatment and cleansing process to ensure that our wastewater meets or exceeds applicable laws and regulations before being released into the environment in 2009 the coca cola system released 179 billion liters of treated wastewater back to the environment and 89 percent of our system facilities representing 95 percent of product volume were compliant with our stringent internal wastewater treatment and discharge standards significant challenges have had an impact on our system achieving 100 percent compliance by the end of 2010 we estimate that 94 percent of system facilities will be compliant with our wastewater treatment standards work is under way at the remaining plants to be compliant by

projects will become more locally relevant to our operations by 2020 we intend to attain our goal of replenishing to nature and communities an amount of water equivalent to that used in our finished beverages since 2005 the coca cola system has engaged in more than 250 community water partnership projects in more than 70 countries in 2009 a total of 54 projects were completed and 33 new projects were initiated in 2009 we asked respected third party experts including the nature conservancy and global environment and technology foundation to work with us to calculate the water benefits of our community water partnership projects to communities and nature initial estimates are that the equivalent of 22 percent of the water used in our finished beverages was replenished through projects completed or ongoing in 2009 in addition to the water volume benefits the pollution reduction benefits from watershed restoration activities were estimated to have reduced sediment load by

14 tyler says the experience had a profound effect on his life i met people who are now lifelong friends i enjoyed a vip trip to canada i gained experience being interviewed on national television and was even a cover boy for a teen magazine but nothing compared with the thrill of actually carrying the olympic torch taylor says in those moments i was the only person in a world of 7 billion who was entrusted with the olympic flame that realization was overwhelming today taylor maintains his healthy lifestyle and uses his torchbearer experience as a springboard for talking to other young people about getting fit setting goals and working toward their dreams he is also a tufts medical center teen spokesperson for a program that helps people prevent and reverse diabetes through healthy eating

our pet plastic bottles by the end of 2011 we expect to have shipped more than 7 billion plantbottletm packages to read about our progress in sustainable packaging please refer to the sustainable packaging section of this report our goal is to give back at least 1 percent of our operating income to communities worldwide through the coca cola company and the coca cola foundation we exceeded that goal in 2010 giving 102 million we provided earthquake relief in japan and flood relief in the united states in 2011 we also used our supply chain and logistics expertise to help deliver critical medicines to people in tanzania to read more about our corporate giving please refer to the corporate giving section of this report we began to gain real traction with our 5 by 20 initiative to empower 5 million women entrepreneurs by 2020 to read more about 5 by 20 please refer to the economic opportunity section of this report furthermore we have continued our commitment to promoting agricultural practices that are better for both farmers and the environment we continued working to make the coca cola company and our entire system a great place to workstarting with an unwavering commitment to workplace and human rights we have increased the number of women in system leadership roles going from 23 percent in 2008 to just over 27 percent in 2010 and we will build on this progress through employee development and recruitment to read more about our workplace initiatives please refer to the great place to work section of this report we take seriously that people want a variety of beverages and packages to meet their needs and lifestyles since 2000 our average calories per serving have decreased by 9 percent globally we have more than 800 low and no calorie beverages nearly 25 percent of our global portfolio we have committed to include calorie information on the front of nearly all our packages by the end of 2011 and to have a physical activity program in every country in which we operate by 2015 today we support physical activity initiatives in more than 100 countries as i hope you will see as you review this report we are making steady progress but we are far from satisfied as we work toward our 2020 vision we will challenge ourselves to quicken the pace of our progress i look forward to sharing future updates with you thank you for your interest in our exciting journey of sustainable growth and sustainable communities very truly yours muhtar kent chairman of the board and chief executive officer 2010 2011 sustainability report the coca cola system global and local corporate and personal we own the world is most valuable brand and are one small part of the good things happening in communities around the world to understand our sustainability strategies it helps to understand our system which gives us a global reach across more than 200 countries a local community presence and the opportunity to make an extraordinary difference the coca cola system includes our company and our bottling partners the system operates in more than 200 countries markets more than 500 brands and 3500 beverage products and sells 17 billion servings of beverages each day our company is headquartered in atlanta georgia and includes our six operating groups eurasia and africaeurope latin america north america pacific and bottling investments the company sources ingredients makes and sells concentrates beverage bases and syrups to our bottling partners owns our brands and is responsible for marketing them our company in consultation with our bottling partners also sets the sustainability agenda for the system and supports bottling partners suppliers and customers in meeting the sustainability goals we set our bottling partners the key to our success and our journey toward sustainability we have nearly 300 bottling partners worldwide they manufacture and package our beverages they also merchandise and distribute our beverages to customers and vending partners who then sell our products to consumers our bottling partners range from large international publicly traded businesses to smallfamily owned operations the vast majority of our bottling partners are not owned or controlled by our company our bottling partners are our most important connection with customers the people who sell our products and consumers likewise they are essential to our sustainability efforts we work closely with them to ensure their operations are aligned with our policies and initiatives bottling partners are engaging in water stewardshipreducing the coca cola system is carbon footprint and investing in and improving the communities where their facilities operate often our bottling partners lead the way by finding new sustainability solutions for example in the united states we are among the newest members of the national clean fleets partnershipa public private partnership created by president obama to help large companies reduce diesel and gasoline use in their fleets the partnership is part of the u s department of energy is doe broader clean cities initiative each member company will work with the doe to develop a strategy to reduce petroleum and diesel use by incorporating electric vehicles alternative fuels and fuel saving measures into their daily operations for some time we have led the beverage industry in clean fleet technology by having more heavy duty hybrid trucks in north america than any other fleet we currently operate more than 700 hybrid electric trucks that reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent when compared to a conventional truck coca cola refreshments usa inc ccr which is the largest bottler in north america and is company ownedis also working to deploy more fully electric trucks ccr currently has two electric trucks from smith electric in the bronx new york and plans to deploy six navistar estar electric trucks in markets including los angelesnew york city san francisco and washington dc our customers putting our products into the hands of people everywhere our customers include just about anyone who sells our products grocery stores restaurants street vendorsconvenience stores movie theaters and amusement parks among others our customers have helped make us the world is largest beverage company and their ongoing support and partnership is fundamental to our success our customers have a role to play in our sustainability efforts as well they work with us to install more energyefficient equipment their businesses are often women owned and operated helping us empower more women around the world they are key to our recovery and recycling efforts and they are often deeply involved in improving their communities providing guidance connection and collaboration for our community improvement efforts to read more about our company and our system please visit our company website the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011 sustainability report water stewardship clean safe accessible water is essential to the health and economic prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems upon which we all rely it is also critical for our business water is the main ingredient in our beverages it is central to our manufacturing process and necessary for growing the agricultural products we use that is why we are intensely engaged in water stewardship and aiming to be water neutral in our direct operations by 2020 to be responsible stewards of the water we use we are becoming more efficient in our water use by reducing the amount we use per liter of product even as we increase our production volume we are recycling wastewater sometimes returning it cleaner than we found it and we are replenishing or offsetting the water used in our finished beverages an estimated 23 percent1 so far we believe the world contains enough water to meet individual ecological agricultural and business needs but only if everyone works to better manage water resources as a consumer of water and as a company with a presence that is at once global and local we have a particular obligation and a unique opportunity to be a responsible steward of this most precious of resources here is how we are working to do our part 1 as part of our verification process we learned that the benefits for two projects had to be adjusted to reflect in the field construction decisions and the overall percentage of the coca cola company cost share of the project mitigating risk for communities and for our system communities and ecosystems need plenty of clean accessible water to thrive and so does our business we regularly invest in multimillion dollar bottling plants whose production capabilities are dependent on local water sources as demand for water increases and water stress intensifies the communities that host our facilities may face serious health and economic challenges and we may face challenges to our growth assess the vulnerabilities of the quality and quantity of water sources for each of our bottling plants and implement a locally relevant water resource sustainability program by the end of 2012 to mitigate water related risks to our system and to the communities we serve we have required every one of our bottling plants to conduct a local source vulnerability assessment these assessments inventory risks to water resources supplying both our facilities and the surrounding communities once their assessments are complete our bottling partners must then develop a locally relevant water resource sustainability program detailing specific risk mitigation actions and deadlines for completing them their programs address water challenges at the watershed level from hydrological vulnerabilities to local government management often the plans include partnerships with local governments and communities water agencies and nongovernmental organizations ngos all of our bottling partners are required to implement their source water protection plans by the end of 2012 progress in progress to date 370 of our 859 systemwide plants have completed source vulnerability assessments and 269 of our plants have begun implementing source water protection plans based on those assessments reducing our water use ratio greater efficiency in our water use does not mean making less product in fact we intend to reduce our water use ratio the amount of water we use to make a liter of product while growing our business by 2012 improve water efficiency by 20 percent compared with a 2004 baseline in 2010 we improved our water use efficiency across the coca cola system for the eighth consecutive year we used 2945 billion liters of water to make 130 billion liters of product giving us a water use ratio of 226 liters per liter of product that is a 4 percent reduction over 2009 and a 16 percent reduction since 2004 our baseline year within the coca cola company our water use was 64398262 kiloliters of which 78 percent was municipal 21 percent was isurface ground and 1 percent was other water rainwater our improvements in 2010 keep us on track to meet our goal of reducing our water use ratio by 20 percent by 2012 efficiency gains have been achieved through initiatives such as using ionized air instead of water to rinse product packages prior to filling reuse of treated wastewater for landscape irrigation and truck washing advanced monitoring of water use and efficiency 2010 coca cola system water use by source billion liters coca cola system water use ratio from 2004 to 2010 average plant ratios based on collected data liters liter of product produced our water use and water use ratio efficiency figures have been recalculated for the europe group for 2004 2005 and 2006 based on changes to the organization these changes affected our system water use ratio for those three years 2010 coca cola system water use ratio efficiency by region average plant ratios based on collected data liters liter of product produced progress in progress we have improved our water use ratio our measure of efficiency by 16 percent to date compared to 2004 recycling wastewater in addition to improving our water use efficiency we are also reducing our impact on local water systems and contributing to improved water quality by recycling wastewater treating it and returning it to the environment we have established a stringent process to ensure that the wastewater we discharge meets and in many cases exceeds standards set by local regulations in fact in some countries we have introduced the very first wastewater treatment facility with statistics showing that 90 percent of wastewater in the developing world is being discharged into the environment without treatment we are committed to ongoing improvements within our own operations and hoping to inspire others to help make significant improvements in this area at this time approximately 86 production facilities across the coca cola company 39 percent of overall facilities have indicated that they reuse water before or after treatment or use collected rainwater and 49 facilities 22 percent of our overall facilities have entered some statistics for the amount of collected rainwater or water reused after treatment although we do not have data at this time for the amount of water reused prior to treatment our reporting indicates more than 2294000 kiloliters of rainwater or treated wastewater has been recycled or reused 2010 internal wastewater discharge limits3 goal by 2010 return to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life the water we use in our system operations through comprehensive wastewater treatment progress in progress we aspire to treat all wastewater from our manufacturing processes as of the end of 2010 we had achieved 93 percent alignment and by the end of 2011 we estimate 96 percent alignment with our stringent standards mg l milligrams per liter maximum value unless applicable legal requirements are more stringent 5 day biological oxygen demand ph level total suspended solids total dissolved solids total nitrogen total phosphorus these are six of the 20 water quality parameters established for the coca cola system depends on receiving stream water conditions in 2010 we released 164 billion liters of treated wastewater across our system including 33 billion liters of treated wastewater for our company owned plants by the end of 2010 100 percent of the 200 company owned plants achieved compliance with our wastewater treatment and discharge standards and now use on sitemunicipal or government approved wastewater treatment plants with secondary treatment additionally 93 percent of our bottling facilities achieved compliance with our wastewater treatment and discharge standards that number fell short of our goal to have 100 percent of the coca cola system is facilities compliant by the end of 2010 by the end of 2012 we expect 100 percent of our plants to meet our requirements because of delays in construction government permitting and financing as well as civil unrest in some cases we estimate that 31 of our bottling plants will not meet our requirements until sometime in 2012 replenishing the water we use in addition to reducing our water use ratio and recycling wastewater we are also working to replenish an amount of water equivalent to what we use in our finished products our facilities around the world are developing strategies and targets to balance their water use by replenishing how much they use with a focus on local needs and specific source vulnerabilities by 2020 safely return to nature and to communities an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production with the help of the nature conservancy academics and other key water stakeholders we have developed a methodology to quantify how much water we have replenished through our community water projects while our most recent analysis has not yet been peer reviewed we estimate 23 percent of the water used in our finished beverages based on 2009 unit case volume was replenished through projects we conducted between 2005 and 2010 up from the 22 percent we reported in our last sustainability report 5 the 2009 2010 sustainability review 5 we freely acknowledge that the science and methodology governing quantification of water benefits and or achieving water neutrality are new and developing we hope the assessment and methodology discussed in this report will contribute positively to the ongoing exploration of this emerging discipline our objective in reporting our efforts to calculate the water benefits associated with our areplenish work is to show how we are doing but it also is for the purpose of continuing an open and transparent dialogue on the appropriate science and methodology to be used to quantify water benefits and ultimately water neutrality we do not intend to say through this report that we have everything correct although we believe that our estimation s of water benefits and the underlying methodology that we used are sound we expressly acknowledge that it may be premature to rely on our water benefit calculations as hard fact progress in progress we estimate that in 2010 we replenished 23 percent of the water used in our finished beverages based on 2010 unit case volume calculating the replenish target for coca cola projects6 includes new ongoing and completed projects we define areplenish as the coca cola system providing support for healthy watersheds and sustainable community water programs to balance or offset the water used in our finished beverages around the world our bottling partners are engaging in community water projects as a way to achieve their replenish targets and build connections with local residents governments and ngos to date we have engaged in 320 community water projects in 86 countries which includes 96 education and awareness programs the projects we engage in have at least one of four objectives to improve access to water and sanitation to protect watersheds to provide water for productive use and or to educate and raise awareness about water issues in many cases projects provide additional benefits such as improving local livelihoods helping communities adapt to climate change improving water quality and enhancing biodiversity of the projects we have launched just over half are complete since our last sustainability report our partnership teams have completed 166 projects and initiated 64 new ones including safe water for africa and the latin american water funds partnership joining another 90 ongoing projects safe water for africa as part of replenish africa initiative rain our six year 30 million commitment to provide access to safe drinking water for communities in africa we joined diageo plc waterhealth international and the international finance corporation in launching the safe water for africa program in may 2011 safe water for africa will bring waterhealth international is waterhealth centers already in use in several african countries to more communities the centers are small modular structures containing equipment that treats locally available water to world health organization standards water is then made available to residents for a nominal usage fee waterhealth international provides operations maintenance and water quality services for 10 years or more to help ensure each center is viability over time the affordable usage fees that residents pay for the service cover the cost of the center is operation and maintenance enabling the community to become sustainable safe water for africa will first focus on countries in west africa where fewer residents have access to water today than 20 years ago by the end of 2011 waterhealth centers will be built in communities in ghana liberia and nigeria also as part of rain we announced in march 2011 a 6 million program to create water and sanitation partnerships aimed at improving the lives of an estimated quarter million women and girls in algeria kenyaliberia morocco nigeria rwanda sierra leone south africa swaziland tanzania tunisia and uganda the lack of water and sanitation facilities in african nations affects billions of people every day and has a particular impact on women and girls who collectively spend billions of hours fetching water each year the latin american water funds partnership in may 2011 fundaci n femsa femsa foundation the philanthropic arm of our largest bottling partner in latin america joined the nature conservancy and the inter american development bank in creating the latin american water funds partnership which will manage all water funds in latin america based on the idea of environmental services payments in which landowners are paid to implement conservation strategies water funds are trust funds dedicated in perpetuity to the conservation of watersheds through the funds water users downstream typically governments businesses and individuals in urban areas invest to help keep resources in rural areas upstream healthy and productive water funds can be powerful tools for conservation funding in 2011 femsa foundation the nature conservancy and inter american development bank created the latin american water funds partnership based on one of the first water funds in quito ecuador known as fonag fonag started with an investment of 21000 that grew up to 10 million in just a decade with more than 900000 in annual interest invested in conservation efforts femsa foundation and its partners are working today to have 32 water funds working in latin america in the next decade through stewardship of 32 water funds the latin american water funds partnership intends to conserve at least 800000 hectares of protected natural areas plus an additional 20000 hectares of key ecosystems water fund proceeds will also be used to introduce conservation and sustainability practices in areas encompassing more than 50000 hectares the partnership projects that by 2015 more than 12 million people will have better access to water and at least 1200 rural families will increase their annual income ongoing partnerships wwf and undp two of the partners we work with most closely on water stewardship are world wildlife fund wwf and the united nations development programme undp we launched a transformational partnership with wwf in 2007 that included a joint commitment to conserve seven of the most important river basins spanning asia europe africa and the americas in each basin we address four central conservation challenges better governance and management resource protection conservation in balance with development and biodiversity protection we have made notable progress in these efforts since our last sustainability report the partnership is achievements include in the yangtze river region improved water quality through the restoration of 547 yards of original river course installed biogas digesters and constructed wetlands and improved agricultural practices and irrigation techniques to reduce water pollution while improving local incomes and livelihoods in the mekong river region helped pass a new statute that allows for park management in accordance with particular ecosystems resulting in restored water flows and grassland habitat and the return of two critically endangered bird species the sarus crane and bengal florican in the danube river region helped purchase and restore liberty island a side branch of the danube located in southern hungary restoring water flow and habitat while maintaining local livelihoods facilitated the formation of the danube network of protected areas to improve wetlands management practices in eight countries in the rio grande rio bravo region trained residents to perform soil conservation and habitat restoration work to improve 10000 hectares of upland forest worked with local citizens to improve the river is flow by removing highly invasive plant species salt cedar and giant cane from sites along more than 70 miles of the river in lake niassa established the lake niassa reserve created 12 community fishing councils and 10 fishery associations that have improved fishing yields and created economic and health benefits by helping communities sustainably manage the lake and its resources in the mesoamerican reef helped develop sustainable production methods for higher value agricultural products like cardamom coffee and honey which have reduced water use and pesticide impacts to the watershed the new revenue streams have increased family incomes benefitting more than 500 families involved in the community based enterprises in the u s southeast rivers and streams bottling partners donated more than 4000 syrup containers for conversion to rain barrels allowing for an estimated 220000 gallons of rainwater to be collected for reuse the rain barrel program has gone national with the potential to capture nearly 10 million gallons of stormwater each year in addition to our work with wwf we have also had a long standing partnership with undp in 2006 we joined undp in launching every drop matterstm an effort to address water related challenges in communities across eastern europe and eurasia the program helps improve sanitation and water quality install rainwater harvesting systems and educate residents about water stewardship in all we have made a 2375 million commitment to support the project through 2014 the achievements of every drop matters in 2010 included promotion of black sea action day which raised awareness of the urgent need to clean up and protect that vital body of water implementation of rooftop water harvesting and water supply systems along with other improvements in two communities in turkey development of water and waste management strategies for small rural communities in romania improved access to drinking water in kazakhstan improvement of wastewater treatment and environmental conditions on the dilijan river in armenia enlistment of local residents across ukraine to rehabilitate natural springs which are often a significant source of local drinking water pilot projects aimed at cleaning up russia is lake baikal and promoting tourism in the area addressing water scarcity through the water resources group in partnership with other businesses and governmental organizations we helped form the 2030 water resources group wrg in 2007 to contribute new insights to the increasingly urgent issue of water scarcity between 2007 and 2010 wrg offered leading thinking on the availability of water between now and 2030 and on the economics of various solutions it focused on raising awareness about the challenge of managing future water needs and piloting partnerships for reform as a result of the group is work several governments facing severe water shortages including india jordan and mexico have engaged in more substantive dialogue on water security water management and policy reform wrg is now entering the second phase of its work its new goal is to support governments as they engage in water analysis convene multistakeholder collaborations and undertake public private partnerships first wrg intends to help countries perform an initial diagnostic of gaps in their water supplies and consider the economics of various solutions then wrg will offer multidisciplinary expertise to help governments develop and test solutions the ultimate objective is to improve water resources management in specific geographical areas measuring and mapping global water risk with the world resources institute in addition to our work with the water resources group we have also joined the aqueduct alliance a consortium of leading water experts from the private and public sectors ngos and academia aqueduct alliance is a program of the world resources institute seeking to measure map and report on global water risk at the heart of the initiative is a global database of water risk information that will enable companies investorsgovernments and others to create water risk maps with an unprecedented level of detail we will support aqueduct alliance is work by providing our own extensive global database of water risk information water footprinting our current water stewardship strategy mainly involves our direct operations and the water sources near them to better understand how we use water indirectly through our supply chain we are investing in water footprint assessments water footprinting is a young science whose methods are still evolving done properly it can tell us a great deal about our indirect water use particularly as it relates to sustainable agriculture we have been a partner of the water footprint network since 2008 supporting the development of the organization and its methodology and over the past two years we have collaborated with the nature conservancy on three water footprint studies coca cola in a 05 liter pet bottle produced by coca cola enterprises inc in the netherlands beet sugar supplied to coca cola bottling plants in europe minute maid orange juice and simply orange produced for north america as important as what we discovered about our water use is the studies told us about footprinting itself the lessons we have learned include the value of water footprinting is in its ability to break out water use by component and demonstrate how each component affects the watershed from which it came the largest portions of the water footprints we assessed involve the farm not the factory supplier information is critical and the water footprints we assessed were highly sensitive to specific data from farms we use to source ingredients though the amount of the footprint attributed to operations is relatively small it is still important for us to manage our direct impacts especially with regard to wastewater treatment to understand the true impact of water use consumption must be considered within the cumulative context of all water uses in a watershed when properly managed even large volumes of water use can be sustainable in locations where the resource is sufficient to support the use water footprints are an excellent tool for companies to begin to understand their water use but numeric footprints alone do not provide sufficient information for consumers to make informed product choices where water is used when it is used and issues affecting quality are all equally important please visit our company website to read the september 2010 water footprint report and the water footprint sustainability assessment towards sustainable sugar sourcing in europe lesson learned seeking the social license for water use in some parts of the world where water is acutely stressed we have encountered opposition to our operations because of perceptions that we are using more than our fair share of water and depleting local water sources to the detriment of local farmers and residents we have worked hard to provide data that show we use water responsibly and to make the case that it would be contrary to our own business interests to damage water sources and harm residents in the process in doing sowe have gained ground in the courts and among regulators we have been successful in securing the technical and aregulatory licenses for using the water we need but where we have sometimes been challenged is in securing the isocial license for our operations among the communities that host us for us to do business and to be part of the solutions addressing water stress it is essential for us to secure the trust and goodwill of the people in the communities where we are located and that can only come from candid continual dialogue an ongoing conversation in which we show residents how much water we are using and how we are using it it comes from telling residents how we are managing water resources and what we are doing to improve them and it comes from helping to address residents specific concerns about water looking ahead water food food energy and climate we are implementing an increasingly holistic approach to water stewardship recognizing that water must be considered in the greater context of political societal and ecological dynamics as we broaden our focus to look beyond water sources directly connected to our operations we will be looking more at the stewardship of water in our agricultural supply chain and even more broadly at the nexus where water food energy and climate perhaps the most pressing issues of this century connect to learn more about training we have developed and our efforts to understand local needs and build plans to address them please see our 2011 water stewardship and replenish report and partnership 2010 annual review the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011 sustainability report energy efficiency and climate protection climate change is one of the most urgent challenges facing our planet and like all challenges it presents unexpected opportunities to do business smarter be a better corporate citizen to reach out and work toward a common objective with people around the world remembering that we do more good when we work together and that success is more sustainable when it is shared the scientific consensus on climate change is clear and the effects of climate change are already well documented the potential effects of climate change on people communities and ecosystems around the world are sobering and demand immediate action climate change could affect our business in numerous ways changing weather patterns could harm global agriculture limiting the supply or increasing the cost of ingredients we use in our products extreme weather could impair our bottling plants disrupt our supply chain and affect demand for our products even our efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs for energy transportation and raw materials cutting our carbon emissions in 2010 we reduced our global greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing by 2 percent compared to 2009 from 533 million metric tons to 520 million metric tons even as our unit case volume increased 5 percent though we are trending in the right direction we still have a lot of work to do to get back to 2004 levels our total emissions in 2010 were 9 percent higher than our 2004 baseline of 479 million metric tons the good news our productivity is improving our global product volume in 2010 was 255 billion unit cases 29 percent more than in 2004 and our greenhouse gas intensity per liter of product has improved 14 percent since 2004 grow our business but not our systemwide carbon emissions in our manufacturing operations through 2015 compared with our 2004 baseline progress in progress 2010 coca cola system greenhouse gas emissions by region from manufacturing sites 1 co2 emissions in millions of metric tons our global manufacturing emissions in 2010 were 2 percent lower than emissions from 2009 these emissionshowever remain 9 percent higher than our 2004 baseline coca cola system greenhouse gas emissions from 2004 to 2010 from manufacturing sites 1 co2 emissions in millions of metric tons by 2015 reduce emissions from our manufacturing operations in developed countries by 5 percent compared to our 2004 baseline progress in progress in 2010 emissions at our manufacturing operations in developed countries were down 1 percent compared with the prior year and down 6 percent compared to 2004 we are currently evaluating materiality of other sources such as ingredient co2 in developed countries we have made steady progress toward our goal of reducing emissions from manufacturing by 5 percent compared to 2004 levels by 2015 in 2010 we reduced emissions in developed countries by 1 percent compared to 2009 and 6 percent compared to 2004 our baseline year we have implemented several measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions since our last sustainability reportthe 2009 2010 sustainability review these measures include through research with coca cola bottling partners and plant managers worldwide and with the help of our partner wwf we developed 10 high return low risk energy best practices for bottling partners to implement by 2012 and a global campaign site for them to register their progress a new combined heat and power plant went online at ballina beverages our ireland based concentrate manufacturing facility in november 2010 the plant captures heat from electricity generation and diverts it to heating and hot water systems this operation is currently exhibiting 17 percent lower carbon dioxide co2 emissions due to heat and power co generation phasing out hydrofluorocarbon hfc coolers hydrofluorocarbons or hfcs are powerful greenhouse gases hundreds of times more potent than carbon dioxide while they currently have a relatively small impact on global warming hfc emissions are anticipated to represent 9 to 19 percent of projected greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 historically much of the refrigeration equipment we and other companies rely on has used hfc based cooling systems with more than 10 million dispensers vending machines and coolers in the marketplace we have the opportunity to contribute to the global response to climate change in 2009 we worked with greenpeace to set a goal of installing 150000 hfc free coolers around the globe by the end of 2010 bringing our global total to 277000 by the end of 2010 we are pleased to report that we have met that goal and exceeded it in 2009 we announced a commitment to achieve 100 percent hfc free new equipment by 2015 starting with 150000 units in 2010 in total we installed 162000 hfc free units in 2010 including 25 on washington dc is capitol hill bringing our global total to 277000 by the end of 2010 additionally we increased that total to 400000 by august 31 2011 goal install 150000 hfc free coolers in the marketplace by 2010 progress achieved by the end of 2010 we had installed approximately 277000 hfc free coolers including 162000 in 2010 alone additionally we increased that total to 400000 by august 31 2011 we are also making steady progress against our pledge to have 100 percent of our cold drink equipment hfc free by 2015 in 2010 approximately 15 percent of our new cold drink equipment purchases were hfc free by phasing out hfcs we expect to avoid the emission of more than 525 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the life of our equipment building a more climate friendly fleet truck exhaust is a source of greenhouse gases more than 200000 of our signature red delivery trucks represent our system around the world we want them to represent sustainable oriented transport as well so we are powering our fleet with a mix of efficient fuels including electricity natural gas diesel electric hybrids and biodiesel along with conventional fuels and we are exploring new options as they become available here are some of our recent achievements we operate the largest hybrid electric fleet in north america it consists of more than 700 trucks that use about 30 percent less fuel than conventional diesels and could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 percent more than 1 million metric tons annually through its safe and eco driving program combined with a complete package of maximum fuel consumptionroute management systems trained drivers and performance monitoring coca cola hellenic has avoided 954 tons of carbon dioxide emissions since 2009 in july 2011 coca cola refreshments our north american company owned bottling operations announced its membership in the national clean fleets partnership a public private partnership sponsored by the u s department of energy clean fleets is intended to help large companies reduce diesel and gasoline use by incorporating electric vehicles alternative fuels and other fuel saving measures ccr is also working to deploy more electric trucks it currently has two electric trucks in the bronx new yorkand six navistar estar electric trucks in markets including los angeles new york city san francisco and washington dc ccr is also training drivers to use driving techniques to conserve fuel and reduce emissions investing in clean energy as part of our carbon reduction strategy we are investing in clean energy technology both in our business and through venture capital funds we have installed solar panels at facilities in macon georgia and coachella california similar installations are under way at four other north american facilities we also began construction on a landfill gas powered co generation system at our atlanta syrup branch the 63 megawatt combined heat and power system will use biomethane from a nearby landfill as its primary fuel we expect it to reduce ccr is carbon footprint by approximately 20400 tons annually partnering around the world to make a difference a challenge as huge and far reaching as climate protection demands cooperation among all segments of society we draw hope and inspiration from our ongoing collaboration with peer companies ngos government officials and others as we all come together to address the critical work before us in 2010 we coordinated a sustainable refrigeration summit bringing together diverse companies to explore more rapid adoption of natural hfc free refrigerants that summit laid the groundwork for the consumer goods forum is pledge to start phasing out hfc refrigerants by 2015 the forum is commitment was announced in november to coincide with the cop 16 u n climate change conference in canc n mexico as a co chair of the consumer goods forum our chief executive officer muhtar kent joined fellow co chairlars olofsson chairman and ceo of carrefour in announcing the consumer goods forum initiatives in canc n mr kent also took part in a panel discussion on the business case for building a low carbon economywhich we co organized with world climate ltd panelists included mexican president felipe calder n dow chemical president chairman and ceo andrew liveris duke energy chairman and ceo jim rogers femsa chief executive officer jos antonio fern ndez and christiana figueres executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change in addition we joined bottling partners coca cola helleniccoca cola enterprises and coca cola ecek in signing the cancun communiqu which asks for a strongeffective framework for addressing climate change goal as of 2015 all new cold drink equipment will be hfc free with an interim goal of being 50 percent hfc free by 2012 progress in progress in 2010 approximately 15 percent of our new cold drink equipment purchases were hfc free increasing our energy efficiency using energy more efficiently enables us to reduce our carbon footprint conserve natural resources and contain costs so through measures sweeping and small we are using energy more efficiently across our business system the total amount of energy consumed by manufacturing sites across our system has grown as our business has grown from 546 billion megajoules in 2004 to 588 billion megajoules in 2010 but our energy efficiency ratio the amount of megajoules used per liter of product has improved in 2010 our ratio was 045 megajoules per liter a 1 percent improvement over 2009 and a 14 percent improvement overall since 2004 by improving our energy efficiency ratio we avoided 163 million in energy costs for 2010 and over 600 million cumulative since 2004 coca cola system energy use from 2004 to 2010 systemwide total based on estimated total use billion megajoules coca cola system energy use ratio from 2004 to 2010 average plant ratios based on collected data megajoules liter of product our energy use figures have been recalculated for 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 based on changes to the organization these changes affected our system energy use ratio efficiency only for 2004 more efficient cooling equipment glass door coolers such as the visi coolers found in convenience stores make up about 74 percent of our total equipment base and nearly 90 percent of the cold drink equipment we purchased in 2010 all newly certified models of glass door coolers are now at least 40 percent more efficient compared to year 2000 levels for example approximately 45 percent of our company owned coolers now contain energy management devicesresulting in an estimated 16 percent reduction in energy consumption for the cooler fleet the total decline was from an estimated 1055 million megajoules of energy that would have been consumed in 2010 without these devices to 890 million megajoules of energy actually consumed in 2010 with the devices in place this decreased energy use has resulted in an estimated emissions reduction of 7 percent upon reaching our goalthese energy management devices will allow us to achieve a total of 35 percent in energy reduction we estimate that approximately 95 percent of our new vending machines and fountain machines which make up the remainder of our equipment base also meet our goal of being at least 40 percent more energy efficient than in 2000 cutting emissions and energy use in developing countries in the ongoing global conversation about energy and climate change emerging countries are often considered the most challenging places to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption developing countries the argument goes have less access to clean energy technology and have more to lose economically from any restrictions on growth that may result from emissions limits but in fact as we build new plants in developing nations we view each as an opportunity to build sustainability into our system through integration of best practices and the latest cleanest most efficient technology in this way bottling partners in developing countries can leapfrog developed nations several of our facilities in emerging economies have already achieved levels of energy efficiency that are instructive for our entire system for example our operations in turkey are the most energy efficient in our global system with an efficiency ratio goal by the end of 2010 increase the energy efficiency of our new cooling equipment by 40 percent compared with 2000 levels progress in progress by the end of 2010 100 percent of our new glass door coolers and 95 percent of our new vending machines and fountain machines were 40 percent more efficient of 026 megajoules per liter our operations in south africa also exhibit remarkable energy efficiency with a ratio of 030 megajoules per liter efficiency at operations in both countries improved in 2010 over 2009 by 4 percent and 6 percent respectively some of our operations in developing countries have also shown reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in absolute or total terms for example absolute emissions from our operations in mexico decreased by about 13 percent between 2009 and 2010 from 450000 metric tons to 392000 metric tons in latin center absolute emissions decreased by 7 percent from 157000 metric tons to 146000 metric tons in china and korea key growing markets for us our emissions dropped from 748000 metric tons in 2009 to 685000 metric tons in 2010 reductions in both countries were achieved despite increased sales volumes another example of how we are growing our business but not our carbon emissions our emissions reductions are sometimes a result of a country or municipality deploying a cleaner power grid we support such efforts whenever we can in mexico for example our long term agreement to buy a certain amount of power from a local utility helped enable development of significant wind power infrastructure building facilities according to leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards is another way we can improve the energy and carbon footprints in developing countries we now have leed certified facilities in progress in brazil and completed in china for more information please see our position statement on climate protection the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011 sustainability report sustainable packaging our product packages help ensure the quality and safe delivery of refreshment for billions of people around the world every day as we grow our business in a world with finite natural resources environmental challenges and heightened consumer expectations our success depends on continuing to find new ways to make our packaging more sustainable and work toward our vision of zero waste we strive to advance our zero waste vision by designing consumer preferred resource efficient packaging eliminating waste to landfills using recycled and or renewable materials since 85 percent of our unit case volume is delivered in recyclable bottles and cans those packages are where our innovation can make the biggest difference and that is where we are focusing most of our effort as we strive to improve our packaging we balance environmental concerns with our need to protect product quality and manufacture and transport our products economically our approach is based on an understanding of the types of packaging we use worldwide as well as an understanding of the impact these packages have over their entire lifecycle 2010 coca cola system global packaging mix we are also looking for packaging ideas that are holistic solutions when viewed in the context of the complete product lifecycle we are interested in innovations that deliver genuine measurable long term advancements toward sustainability and not just eye grabbing marketing slogans that will earn us public relations points in the near term capturing the embodied energy and raw materials in beverage bottles for reuse through recycling we believe is a better option for our business and for the environment than a biodegradable packaging when considered over the package lifecycle managing packaging to manage risk most people do not think about business risk when they look at a beverage container but we do our packages help meet our strict quality requirements and safely deliver our products to consumers if a package is not energy efficient to produce it could erode our profitability similarly any time the cost of packaging materials like petroleum and aluminum increases or any time the supply of those materials is disrupted it means potential harm for our business also changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and other packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products finally being viewed as a contributor to global pollution could damage our brand developing more sustainable packaging enables us to reduce our business risk along with our impact on the environment creating more efficient packaging in 2010 we continued the innovative lightweighting of our packaging that has proven to save costs materials and resources in fact in 2010 we saved 90 million by reducing packaging waste here is a snapshot of our efforts from around the world by 2015 improve packaging material efficiency per liter of product sold by 7 percent compared with a 2008 baseline we launched a 105 gram damla 500 ml pet bottle in turkey our operations in the philippines reduced the use of glass material by 20 percent through the continued rollout of ultra glass we avoided 5 million in costs by rolling out the 1881 short height closure on large polyethylene terephthalatebetter known as pet bottles in north america these achievements are a small sample of the latest in a years long effort to make our packaging more efficient cumulatively since these packaging types were introduced we have in progress each market around the world is aggressively looking for ways to reduce costs and the ongoing lightweighting efforts provide an opportunity to decrease packaging costs while offering environmental benefits trimmed the weight of our 20 ounce pet plastic bottle by more than 25 percent shaved 30 percent from the weight of our 12 ounce aluminum can lightened our 8 ounce glass bottle by more than 50 percent investing in recycling programs if we are serious about maximizing the value of the packaging material we put into the market recovering our beverage containers for reuse is essential we provide leadership and funding for recovery systems around the world today we recover about 36 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans sent to market by 2015 recover 50 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans1 used annually beverage containers remain among the most recycled consumer product packages in the world recovery and recycling is complicated by the fact that waste management is very much a local issue with different circumstances in every locale there is no one size fits all solution and no way we can solve this problem alone we recognize that collaboration is critical to advance our vision faster so we work closely with governmentsngos local communities and our industry partners to create stewardship systems that make sense for the markets they serve and whenever possible create jobs in developing markets we work with government and industry to advance informal collection systems helping them become formal systems for the recovery of packaging material while creating sustainable jobs in developed markets we support approaches that include comprehensive recovery of materials through industry recovery organizations our support of recycling systems spans the globe in 2010 the thailand institute of packaging and recycling management for sustainable environment an industry organization we are part of embarked on a new partnership with authorities in thailand is pathum thani province the project aims to develop a more comprehensive and effective integrated waste management program in mexico is toluca valley bottling partner grupo cimsa continued its successful pet bottle collection program started in 2002 the program now includes 737 collection points including locations at schools churches hospitals and ngos approximately 233000 people have participated in the program to date we also expanded a partnership we initially launched in brazil to a regional initiative for pan latin america the regional initiative for inclusive recycling is a four year effort to transform the recycling market in latin america by improving the socioeconomic status of recyclers and their families enhancing private sector roles so that recycling cooperatives thrive in a competitive market and supporting public policy so that recycling cooperatives become part of local waste management systems the partnership includes the inter american development bank fundaci n avina and the bill melinda gates foundation educating consumers is also key to increasing recycling rates in north america coca cola recycling education vehicles travel to various cities teaching consumers about the good things that happen when people recycle equipped with interactive displays games and videos our fleet of five education vehicles will visit venues and events where our products are consumed throughout 2011 supporting the rpet market for recycling programs to work the programs need to be strong end markets for reprocessed pet plasticknown in the industry as rpet to help ensure a demand for rpet we support the creation of merchandise made from the material we are involved in partnerships that make a variety of consumer goods from rpet progress in progress we currently recover about 36 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans we send to market 1 recover 50 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans means we intend to help ensure that an amount of bottles and cans equal to 50 percent of the ones we introduce into the marketplace are recovered including caps t shirts bags notebooks and the emeco 111 navy chair through these merchandise programswe are reinforcing our give it back campaign we are engaging consumers and educating them that their actions can make a difference with simple messaging such as letting them know that five recycled pet bottles can become one of their favorite t shirts helping to clean up the oceans marine litter though its causes and effects are not fully understood is a matter of great concern to us scientistsconservationists and others unfortunately our packaging is among the waste that can be found improperly disposed of on shorelines around the world so we have an obligation to help address marine litter in earnest for 16 years we have partnered with ocean conservancy providing funding in kind support and volunteer assistance to help clean up the seas and further investigate the causes and effects of marine pollution in late 2010 we co hosted a workshop on accelerating solutions for marine debris with ocean conservancy the workshop facilitated by the keystone center brought together leading thinkers and practitioners from government industry academia and the ngo community who are committed to advancing research and solutions on the issue the workshop outcomes provided input into the design and content of the fifth international marine debris conference that was held in march 2011 by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the united nations environment programme the coca cola company was invited to serve as the industry representative on the steering committee and as a lead sponsor of the conference in 2011 we helped ocean conservancy launch the trash free seas alliance a cooperative group of businesses ngos scientific institutions and community groups that share the common goal of eliminating ocean trash our hope is that the trash free seas alliance will accelerate action among the varied stakeholders who must work together to restore the world is seas one of the first accomplishments of this group was the proposal acceptance by the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis nceas to support a working group on marine debris nceas is one of the foremost ecological think tanks in the world this working group will bring together a group of leading ecologists oceanographers social scientists industry market experts behavioral economists and polymer scientists to evaluate existing data and published information as well as conduct integrative modeling to significantly advance the scientific understanding of marine debris globally implementing our new packaging management system slow but steady progress in our last sustainability report the 2009 2010 sustainability review we announced implementation of a new comprehensive product management system that will enable us to improve packaging efficiency and better track packaging over its lifespan from raw materials through design manufacturing use and disposal such tracking can help leverage our new package designs from market to market and bottler to bottler and improve packaging efficiency and resource management we had expected to be using the system by early 2011 in fact while we have collected much of the data we need to implement the system as we envisioned it a great deal of work remains gathering information from our bottling partners around the world is taking more time than we expected also capturing data on packages other than our bottles and cans wrappers and boxes for example has also proved more time consuming than we predicted increasing our use of recycled and renewable materials tm packaging redefining the performance of plastic packaging more than 50 percent of our beverage volume is delivered in plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate better known as pet we use pet plastic bottles for many reasons consumers like them because they are lightweight resealable and shatter resistant they are also highly recyclable which is one of the reasons we continue to focus our innovation on pet versus another type of plastic the processes for making and transporting pet bottles are relatively energy efficient and cost effective and pet plastic protects our product quality exceptionally well the environmental lifecycle performance of pet combined with its operational performance makes this plastic package a sound business choice but with increasing pressure on natural resources particularly on the petroleum and natural gas required to make conventional pet bottles businesses like ours are seeking alternatives to conventional pet bottles that is why our research and development team created plantbottletm packaging plantbottletm is the first ever fully recyclable pet bottle made partially from plants while we are proud of the incremental improvements made to enhance pet packaging over the years we believe more transformative changes are required to stay competitive in a world with increasing pressures on natural resources with plantbottletm packaging we have a commercial solution today for manufacturing one of the two primary ingredients in pet from plant based material and are well on our way to discovering a commercial solution for the second ingredient in 2010 alone the use of this breakthrough packaging eliminated more than 60000 barrels of oil as our plantbottletm packaging is in part made from plants that absorb carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere we estimate that our use of plantbottletm packaging in the first two years has helped save the equivalent annual emissions of more than 100000 metric tons of carbon dioxide which is equal to emissions from more than 20000 automobiles our target is to have all virgin pet plastic used in our bottles made with plantbottletm packaging by 2020 goal source 25 percent of our pet plastic from recycled or renewable material by 2015 progress in progress plantbottletm packaging is available in 16 markets and more than 7 billion plantbottletm packages will have shipped by the end of 2011 we also continue to support recycling systems around the world including our investment in bottleto bottle recycling plants an idea like plantbottletm has too much good potential to keep to ourselves so in february 2011 we shared our technology and entered into a partnership with h j heinz company enabling heinz to bottle its ketchup in plantbottletm packaging moving forward we will continue to explore the potential of such partnerships with other companies others are noticing the value of plantbottletm as well in 2010 plantbottletm won a dupont award for packaging innovation from among more than 160 other global entrants in april 2011 plantbottletm packaging received an edison award recognizing the most innovative products from a variety of categories we believe so strongly in plantbottletm as a catalyst for change that we are working with our partners to rapidly expand the plantbottletm supply chain in just a few short years we have expanded from producing plantbottletm pet plastic in a single location to now having facilities in most of our major markets with much more expansion to come as we continue to grow the capacity of plantbottletm packaging material we are working with partners in academia to ensure that the source of plant based material also remains environmentally and socially sustainable increasing recycled content as we look for alternatives to nonrenewable materials we are also increasing the amount of recycled material in our packages to date our system has invested in seven2 bottle to bottle facilities that improve our capacity for using recycled material we continue to invest in exploration of new technologies that could enable us to increase the amount of recycled material we use we are also working with countries around the world to remove regulations that bar the use of recycled materials and to secure additional approvals for the use of such materials 2 this figure represents our systemwide investments the challenge of getting our message out one important lesson we have learned on our journey toward zero waste is that more sustainable packaging is a complex issue and a hard one to communicate terms like arenewable and arecyclable can blur together in the public is mind and innovations mean little if they are not readily available in the market or if consumers do not perceive them as convenient and beneficial we have seen that we have to work harder at communicating clearly with consumers and other stakeholders when we believe we have made an important advancement in packaging for example we have found it is important to remind consumers that our plantbottletm packaging is still fully recyclable and not biodegradable despite being made partly from plants similarly we have been challenged in communicating the benefits of our ultra glass contour bottle for coca cola the ultra glass design is smaller and on average 20 percent lighter yet is stronger less expensive to produce and holds the same amount of product as its predecessor best of all it has saved tens of thousands of metric tons of glass and related greenhouse gas emissions but despite these benefits and our efforts to communicate them consumers in some markets have perceived the package as containing less product and have been slow to accept it as we continue to advance our efforts in each of our focus areas we intend to better communicate the work we are doing and why it matters to our business as well as governments consumers and ngos as we all work toward eliminating waste and recognizing the value of packaging looking ahead industrywide metrics a positive recent trend we see in the movement toward zero waste is the development of common metrics for more sustainable packaging being facilitated by the consumer goods forum a common language along with a framework and measurement system on packaging sustainability will help businesses governmentsconsumers and ngos as we all work toward eliminating waste the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011

philanthropic organization through the coca cola company the foundation and our 19 local and regional foundations worldwide we partner with governments ngos and other organizations to support community improvement in four main areas water stewardship healthy and active lifestyles community recycling and education we also fund disaster relief in communities facing crisis our goal is to give back at least 1 percent of our operating income annually to improve the living standards of people around the world in 2010 we invested 102 million an increase of 16 percent over 2009 between 2002 and 2010 our foundation gave a total of 273 million our total charitable contributions during that period through our foundation and contributions from our company were more than 690 million following are some highlights of our giving increased collaboration on disaster relief in march 2011 we established the coca cola japan reconstruction fund with a total pledge of 33 million for ongoing relief and recovery efforts in japan including donations of more than 7 million cases of beverages to national and local government authorities and other community groups the coca cola company and the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc have collaborated for many decades but in january 2011 we announced an expanded three year partnership to enhance the humanitarian impact of our collaboration the coca cola company is investing 2 million to support the ifrc is work in disaster response and preparedness and public engagement separately our foundation is donating 1 million to the ifrc is disaster response emergency fund which provides immediate financial support to help red cross and red crescent national societies respond quickly to disasters around the world in addition to monetary support the partnership uses the coca cola system is production distribution and marketing expertise to improve the partners joint disaster response and build public support for the efforts of the red cross and red crescent societies water stewardship in china we support world wildlife fund is wwf returning water to people and nature project in the upper yangtze river

cash expertise and in kind support to initiatives and partnerships intended to strengthen communities here are several initiatives we have been part of since our last sustainability report the 2009 2010 sustainability review engaging with partners for a new beginning partners for a new beginning pnb is an alliance of public private partnerships designed to deepen engagement between the united states and local communities abroad pnb formed in response to president obama is 2009 speech at cairo university in egypt which addressed a vision for a new beginning between the united states and muslim communities the initiative formally launched in april 2010 during the white house summit on entrepreneurship a platform that explored the role of the private sector in creating economic growth and fostering entrepreneurship both in the united states and abroad muhtar kent chairman and ceo of the coca cola company and walter isaacson president and ceo of the aspen institute serve as pnb vice chairs former u s secretary of state madeleine k albright chairs the initiative and a 14 member steering committee composed of public and private sector leaders based in the united states supports pnb is work pnb has established local chapters in algeria egypt indonesia morocco pakistan the palestine authority area tunisia and turkey through the operating model of locally owned and locally driven partnership local chapters assess community needs and priorities creating an action plan of target initiatives to launch or to expand local and international partners collaborate based on the priorities identified more than 70 projects are currently under way in the focus areas of education exchange economic opportunity science and technology our company is actively engaged with pnb through participation in local chapters and projects in pakistan for example the company partnered with international relief development to assist the recovery of 500 of the most vulnerable small holder farmer households the project rehabilitates farmers and distributes seed to restart sugarcane crop cultivation while providing farmers with training to increase their yields this project has ensured a three year cycle of sugarcane cultivation giving families a chance for sustainable livelihoods and recovery from flood induced losses coca cola is supporting a number of additional projects including a youth innovation summit with the palestinian local chapter and a women is economic empowerment initiative with the local chapter in turkey to learn more please visit the pnb website also in march 2011 we announced that we will dedicate 6 million to our replenish africa initiative rain to improve the lives of 250000 women and girls in algeria morocco tunisia and elsewhere by improving water and sanitation systems helping to deliver medicine to tanzania one of our greatest assets in helping communities is our vast global supply and distribution network recognizing this we began an initiative in august 2010 which taps into our logistics expertise to help resolve bottlenecks in the supply of critical medications to the people of tanzania we collaborated on the project with the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the bill melinda gates foundation and accenture development partnerships looking ahead corporate giving is evolving in the past companies including ours that wanted to support communities were likely to write a check and wish benefiting communities well today companies are increasingly called upon to effect change by lending expertise and taking part in the change process while financial support is still crucial a company is continuing engagement along with application of its core competencies and assets is just as important if not more so for creating change that lasts we expect our giving to continue to follow this trend our global system gives us an uncommonly widespread presence enabling us to engage with communities large and small in more than 200 countries while we welcome opportunities for deeper engagement they sometimes make our work more challenging it is easy to issue a press release unveil a plan and hand over a check it is difficult to do the painstaking messy work of actually collaborating with multiple partners often in disparate places and cultures to solve entrenched problems progress is sometimes slower than expected and the most skillfully conceived initiatives sometimes fail as we strive to build strong vibrant communities we can only pledge to bring the best of our resources to bear to be clear about our intentions and transparent about our progress and to learn from our achievements and our mistakes the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011 sustainability report economic opportunity supporting local economies is both a matter of good corporate citizenship and good business through jobs capital investment and targeted initiatives offering opportunities to residents we are part of the global engine that keeps local economies humming as one of the world is most successful and ubiquitous companies we consider it an obligation to invest in local economies from our earliest days our business has provided opportunities and resources that enable people and communities to raise their standard of living we know from long experience that when hardworking talented people are given the chance they can create abundance that benefits us all supporting the economic health of communities also makes our business more sustainable because our system is only as strong as the economies in which we do business by creating opportunities throughout our value chain we increase our access to local procurement and are able to penetrate hard to reach markets through local entrepreneurs by investing in local economies and being a good corporate neighbor we also earn our isocial license to do business in those places our ability to grow in emerging markets where economic need is often greatest is particularly critical to our long term success so we focus many of our economic initiatives in those places our economic impact our system employs approximately 700000 people around the globe our supply chain employs millions more add to those numbers the capital we spend in communities the local taxes we pay and even the dividends we pay to our shareowners and it is easy to see that our economic impact is considerable in 2010 our direct global economic impact totaled 266 billion up 14 percent from 2009 2010 company direct global economic impact b billion creating opportunity through targeted initiatives in addition to our economic ripple we also support local economies through targeted initiatives that offer opportunity to the people and places that need it most here is a progress report on our most recent efforts enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across our value chain by 2020 by 20 in september 2010 we launched our commitment to 5 by 20 an effort to economically empower 5 million women entrepreneurs in our global value chain by 2020 5 by 20 aims to enable women entrepreneurs to break down social and economic barriers by providing them with access to skills training financial services and support networks of peers and mentors we define entrepreneur as virtually any woman connected with our businessincluding farmers shopkeepers micro distributors recycling collectors and artisans we recognize that we cannot meet 5 by 20 is ambitious goal single handedly that is why we are partnering with governments ngos banks and other companies by pooling our experience with that of our partners we can have a profound and lasting impact 5 by 20 is already under way in many countries with an initial focus on four important growing markets brazilindia the philippines and south africa our business units in these countries are leading the way by embedding 5 by 20 in their business plans and processes we have also begun building on existing initiatives such as our residential entrepreneurship training program in brazil our mobile retail training centers in india and our support of women retailers in south africa reaching out to women is logical for us because women are not only pillars of their communities but also pillars of our business making up a disproportionately high percentage of key segments of our value chain in some markets women own or operate 85 percent of the small neighborhood stores that sell our products as we move toward our goal of doubling our business by 2020 small scale retailers and distributors will be an important contributor to our success so our initial 5 by 20 activities will focus on women in these roles by investing in their success we invest in our own what is more unleashing the entrepreneurial potential of women is one of the most effective and sustainable ways we can help more families and communities prosper empowering women will also provide more choices for women and help create female role models in places where economic opportunities for women have historically been limited micro distribution centers for more than a decade we have grown both our business and local economies through our micro distribution centers mdcs small product distribution centers managed by local people in developing countries mdcs help us do business in hard to reach communities while supporting local economies in exchange we offer assistance to independent entrepreneurs our original mdc model was developed in africa and in many african countries mdcs account for the majority of sales currently in africa there are more than 3200 mdcs that employ over 19000 people generating more than 950 million in annual revenue many mdcs are in high density areas where a lack of good roads and infrastructure makes it difficult for delivery trucks to travel mdcs in kenya mozambique tanzania and uganda account for the vast majority of our sales in those countries the number of mdcs in north and west africa is growing rapidly more than 800 of our african mdcs are owned and managed by women and an additional 800 are co owned by women in fact more than half of the new mdcs created since 2009 are owned and run by women in fastergrowing markets like ghana and nigeria female ownership exceeds 70 percent since joining the business call to action in 2008 our system has created more than 1100 new mdcs which in turn has generated more than 11500 new jobs working with various external partners we also researched ways to improve the development impacts of the mdc model and shared this learning across our system we have seen similar expressions of the mdc model introduced in china and the philippines we expect that as our business grows toward 2020 micro distributors will continue to play an increasing role in our overall routeto market strategies project nurture we expect our juice

assured by fira please click logo for assurance statement 2010 2011 sustainability report workplace and human rights respecting human rights and protecting workplace rights is fundamental to our culture and imperative for a sustainable business in our company and across our system we are working to make sure all people are treated with dignity and respect we consider workplace and human rights as articulated in the united nations universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organization is declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work to be inviolable we take a proactive approach to securing these rights in every workplace of the coca cola company in our bottling system in our supply chain and in the communities in which we operate the foundation of our approach lies in three key documents our human rights statement our workplace rights policy and our supplier guiding principles all three are profoundly influenced by the united nations and international labour organization declarations together they describe our high standards and our expectations with respect to human rights and workplace rights collectively they address such subjects as child labor forced labor freedom of association discrimination health and safety hours of work and the 30 articles contained in the universal declaration of human rights we expect our company our bottling partners and our suppliers to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts as a result of business actions and to address such impacts when they occur furthermore our company bottling partners and suppliers are also responsible for preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts directly linked to their operations products or services by their business relationships even if they have not contributed to those impacts to meet this expectation our company bottling partners and suppliers have begun the work of incorporating processes for identifying preventing and mitigating their impacts on human rights additionally all are required to implement a process for remediation of any adverse human rights impacts they cause or contribute to in recent years we have more clearly defined what we stand for in regard to workplace and human rights we have also begun the complex work of ensuring that our entire business system and supply chain align with our policies it is a long journey much of it lies ahead and we have made notable progress since our last sustainability report the 2009 2010 sustainability review ensuring compliance across our system and among our suppliers at the end of 2010 91 percent of our company owned facilities had achieved compliance with our workplace rights policy this puts us well on track to meet our goal of achieving 98 percent compliance by 2015 by 2015 achieve a 98 percent compliance level for company owned and managed facilities upholding the standards set in our workplace rights policy also achieve 90 percent compliance with our supplier guiding principles among independent franchise bottling partners and suppliers as for suppliers and bottling partners we expect them to comply with applicable laws and respect workplace and human rights principles we encourage them to adopt our human rights statement and workplace rights policy or equivalents to comply with our supplier guiding principles and to uphold the standards we have set for everyone doing business under the coca cola trademark we convey our expectations and offer compliance assistance through our supplier guiding principles program we are aiming to have 90 percent of our bottling partners and suppliers comply with our supplier guiding principles by 2015 as of december 31 2010 63 percent had achieved compliance deepening our engagement with suppliers in fall 2009 we began to build on our supplier guiding principles program by starting a more robust dialogue with suppliers about human rights and other sustainability efforts our aim was to move beyond compliance and work collaboratively with suppliers on a joint sustainability agenda the result of our efforts which included a meeting with chief executive officers and chief operating officers of 32 of our top global suppliers was our isupplier engagement pyramid a five tier engagement model we developed with our supplier guiding principles program as the foundation to manage our work with suppliers going forward our five tiers of engagement are 1 dialogue on sustainability opportunities 2 supplier operational improvements 3 business to business supply chain efficiencies 4 acceleration of signature programs 5 emerging opportunities and innovations while we have started with a small group of large mostly global and strategic suppliers we must ultimately broaden integration of sustainability as a value within our procurement process to that end many of our regional procurement entities have launched their own specific programs on supplier sustainability coca cola enterprises in europe for example held a supplier sustainability summit in 2010 engaging 80 suppliers across a diverse set of categories our operations in china india and the philippines have held similar meetings achieving compliance through third party audits in our 3500 significant supplier locations our process is to prevent noncompliant suppliers from entering our system in order to do this we first screen suppliers according to our guidelines and if they fail the screening we do not proceed with a contract to help our company our bottling partners and our suppliers achieve compliance third party auditors trained to our standards conduct regular workplace assessments we conduct annual assessments of new suppliers and suppliers with a history of noncompliance for suppliers with a history of compliance we conduct assessments every three years nearly 10000 assessments have been completed since 2003 2010 audits by region by the end of 2010 we assessed 81 percent of our direct supplier facilities bottling partners and company owned facilities of those 63 percent achieved compliance with our workplace rights policy and supplier guiding principles standards exceeding our interim goal of achieving 60 percent compliance by 2010 our commercial products supply facilities achieved 100 percent compliance with our workplace rights policy in 2010 and two of our largest bottling partners swire beverages limited and coca cola femsa achieved 100 percent compliance with our supplier guiding principles amid these successes we are addressing increasing reports of audit fraud in china india and mexico incidents generally involve counterfeit audit reports or suppliers providing false information and documents to auditors in response we are improving our detection efforts and assessing our practices to make sure we are not enabling or compelling fraud we want suppliers to know that accurate assessments are essential that we support their progress in progress as of december 31 2010 91 percent of our company owned facilities achieved compliance along with 63 percent of our bottling partners and suppliers continuous improvement and that we do not take the comply or die approach some suppliers fear to help solve this problem we are consulting with peer companies and other experts investigating rights related complaints we require all associates of the coca cola company to know our workplace standards and human rights principles and to apply them in their work managers receive particularly intensive training we also rely on our associates to speak up immediately if they believe our policies have been violated associates can report perceived violations confidentially and without fear of retaliation through numerous channels including our ethicsline a toll free secure phone line and website in 2010 we investigated 118 perceived workplace rights violations up from 93 in 2009 the largest number of complaints related to discrimination which includes retaliation and harassment and work hours and wages in cases where claims are substantiated we take corrective action depending on the violation corrective action may take the form of back pay reassignment of duties and in severe cases separation from the company furthermore we detected no issues where freedom of association had been denied in 2010 as determined through both our workplace assessment process which includes more than 2000 assessments and contacts made to the company through our ethicsline this hotline is a grievance mechanism available to our associatesbottling partners and suppliers as well as our customers and consumers and we take action in response to every allegation 2010 workplace rights policy cases reported by category management practices other is a category created to capture cases that came in via the ethicsline as issues of workplace rights but that do not fit into a workplace rights category by definition workplace rights policy cases reported by category 2009 and 2010 2009 freedom of association and collective bargaining forced labor child labor discrimination includes harassment and retaliation hours of work and wages safe and healthy workplace workplace security community and stakeholder engagement management practices other total management practices other is a category created to capture cases that came in via the ethicsline as issues of workplace rights but that do not fit into a workplace rights category by definition refreshing our policies and management training in early 2011 we updated our human rights statement and workplace rights policy after reviewing a danish institute for human rights analysis of gaps in our global policies we addressed the gaps by updating our manager is guide on implementing the statement and policy adding new guidance regarding hate speechindigenous peoples and other matters we also refreshed the understanding of our human rights policies among leaders across our company through online training in september 2011 we updated our audit protocols and supplier training based on the danish institute is analysis further aligning suppliers and bottling partners with our company policies and practices additionally over the course of 12 months approximately 15000 company associates participated in 45 minute human rights statement and workplace rights policy training sessionsresulting in more than 11000 hours of training on our company policies and procedures new framework for respecting human rights since 2005 we have worked to support the mandate of john ruggie the un special representative for business and human rights in developing guiding principles for implementing his protect respect and remedy framework for respecting human rights in a business context as part of that work we have hosted several meetings of business leaders and others to increase understanding of human rights and share best practices the meetings were co sponsored by the international organization of employers the u s council for international business and the u s chamber of commerce in may 2011 we formally endorsed professor ruggie is framework which the un human rights council adopted in june our support for the mandate of professor ruggie builds on our work as a participant of the un global compact and member of the global business initiative on human rights and its predecessor the business leaders initiative on human rights our work in those partnerships continues in january 2011 we joined 17 companies in launching the global compact lead program which challenges compact members to achieve a blueprint for sustainable corporate responsibility preventing human trafficking our company addresses human trafficking and forced labor through both our workplace rights policy and our supplier guiding principles these policies are supported by independent assessments of both supplier and company owned facilities and are conducted by third parties to verify compliance with our standards that prohibit trafficking and slavery in supply chains in 2010 we expanded research into the recruitment and employment practices of migrant labor in our supply chain and persian gulf area we will use this research to develop expanded efforts to combat forced labor collaborating with labor we respect the rights of workers in our system to join unions without the fear of retaliation and engage in collective bargaining without interference or fear of retaliation more than 30 percent of workers in our system are represented by trade unions of those more than 70 percent are affiliated with the international union of foodworkers iuf one of our business system is most important stakeholders maintaining a productive relationship with trade unions enables us to collaborate with them on key issues affecting our company is success it also enables us to solve problems constructively and manage risk if we are unable to address legitimate labor union concerns renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or address workplace inequities in a timely way our business could suffer through strikes lawsuits a global corporate campaign or other labor unrest twice each year since 2005 we have met at our atlanta headquarters with iuf delegates from around the world to discuss labor and workplace issues in our system these meetings enable us to have frank conversations and address and resolve difficult issues across a table through a serious and practical engagement from both sides for example in 2009 and 2010 we were able to resolve a number of contentious labor issues in pakistan in october 2010 we joined the iuf in reaffirming our commitment to our semiannual meeting process we encourage our bottling partners to collaborate with labor organizations as well in september 2010 we presented a program to equatorial coca cola bottling company to help that company implement our workplace rights policy that same month we hosted a meeting in athens greece where we achieved further alignment among bottling partners in addressing issues related to labor relations and human and workplace rights in 2011we are enhancing our systems for identifying workplace rights problems early we are also providing bottling partners with resources and human rights due diligence checklists to address such issues as contract labor plant siting and human rights in the supply chain ensuring ethical engagement of contract labor like many companies our company and bottling partners employ contract and agency labor we believe there are many legitimate uses of contract labor and we expect contract workers through third party providers to continue to play an important role in our business we do not track the aggregate number of contract laborers working in our system due to the highly seasonal nature of our business in many parts of the world and because of the varying circumstances in which our bottling partners and business units engage with contract labor our commitment to human and workplace rights as well as our commitment to operating a sustainable businesscompels us to respect the rights of all workers including those not directly employed by our company or bottling partners what is more improper treatment of contract laborers would put our business at risk of lawsuits action by regulatory agencies and damage to our reputation so we are working with our business units and our bottling partners to develop a proactive holistic approach to managing contract labor that protects workers and our company by addressing critical issues at each phase of a contract worker is engagement with us from our initial decision to use contract labor through the end of the relationship with labor suppliers or specific workers we expect our personnel and our bottling partners to understand the risks associated with contract labor and carefully manage the labor agencies engaged we also expect them to provide training and a safe work environment and to avoid using termination practices that circumvent legal obligations we take a number of steps to ensure responsible engagement of the contract and agency workers we employincluding our human rights statement workplace rights policy and supplier guiding principles outline our commitments and expectations for treatment of all workers any allegation of worker abuse including abuse of contract laborers is a very serious issue that we fully investigate we conduct continuous assessments of our operations and of key authorized contract labor suppliers to ensure the responsible treatment of contract laborers we engage with key stakeholders to understand their perspective regarding potential abuse of contract workers the subject of contract and agency labor is a standing agenda item for our semiannual meetings with the iuf please see collaborating with labor above through these meetings we have successfully addressed a number of concerns regarding contract workers in india pakistan and the philippines we are providing our largest bottling partners with contract labor risk mitigation checklists and other similar tools to help them manage contract labor appropriately addressing child labor in sugarcane fields our human rights statement workplace rights policy and supplier guiding principles prohibit the use of child labor while there is no child labor in our company owned operations we are aware that child labor persists on the farms that grow cane for our sugar suppliers the company does not typically purchase ingredients directly from farms nor are we owners of sugar farms and plantations sugarcane harvesting is especially hazardous because of the machetes used in the work yet poverty and local social norms often result in children working in the cane fields we have taken an approach to child labor in sugarcane fields that is at once global and local we set policyconvene experts and engage with governments ngos and other companies around the world at the same time we collaborate with suppliers industry groups and local stakeholders to address the issue with farmers at the local level since our 2009 2010 sustainability review we have taken action in countries including el salvador hondurasmexico and the philippines here are our recent activities in el salvador we have continued participating in collaboration with ilo ipec the salvadoran sugar industrygovernments ngos and others these efforts have helped to reduce child labor in cane fields by 72 percent between 2003 and 2008 we helped honduras is sugar association board of directors arrange for all the country is sugar refineries to commit to addressing child labor the initial plan calls for evaluation intervention and education benchmarking and contracting and enforcement and monitoring activities to be implemented on a long term basis starting with the 2011 harvest the first stage was developed by completing an independent assessment of child labor in the country is sugarcane supply chain which revealed minimal presence of child labor in the honduras sugar supply chain our partnership with ipec in mexico resulted in a commitment by two sugar suppliers to pilot child labor awareness and education programs at their mills cane farms if the pilot succeeds other mills will replicate it through the 2011 2012 harvest in september 2010 the coca cola foundation joined the ilo ipec director for the philippines the government of bukidnon province and the sugar industry foundation in launching a four year initiative to eliminate child labor in bukidnon in addition to our farm focus work we are also engaged in the ongoing global conversation about eradicating child labor we are part of a 13 member u s department of agriculture consultative group on child and forced labor that will serve by u s congressional mandate through 2012 also in 2010 our workplace rights team participated among 450 delegates from 80 countries at a two day global child labor conference in the hague organized by ilo ipec and the government of the netherlands delegates adopted a roadmap to 2016 which sets measurements for eliminating the worst forms of child labor over the next five years eradicating child labor is a complex and often frustratingly slow process requiring consensus and cooperation among many stakeholders it is made all the more difficult by persistent poverty and lack of access to education in cane growing regions still based on our progress and the lessons we have learned to date we are hopeful about our opportunities to contribute to substantial lasting change progress on hours of work in addition to our work on child labor we have made progress in addressing several other human rights and workplace concerns since our 2009 2010 sustainability review compliance with local work hours and overtime laws is a fundamental component of our workplace rights policy and supplier guiding principles to help bottling partners and suppliers understand and manage hours of work issues our business unit in brazil where regulations cap worker hours at 40 per week identified reasons for overtime and rest day violations and sought to mitigate them bottling partners first noted that overtime was often logged mistakenly because workers were not clocking out for coffee and meal breaks and other off the clock activities once they addressed that issue and others bottling partners then tracked hours of work per month compared to the previous year as well as the associated economic impact after a year of focusing on stricter compliance 11 bottling partners reported an 86 percent reduction in overtime 38 million in annual savings and increased off work time for more than 34000 workers based on the work in brazil we have developed a guidance document to help other facilities in our system reduce overtime calvert adds us to its social investment fund index protecting human and worker rights in a company as large and complex as ours is a challenging and continual process so we welcome signs that we are moving in the right direction in january 2011 calvert investments announced that we met its

have a place in a sensible balanced diet combined with regular physical activity we believe a healthful diet is not about avoiding any one food beverage or ingredient rather it is about making sensible choices that include consuming a variety of foods and beverages in moderation and ensuring individual nutrition needs are met and energy balance is achieved at a level consistent with a

reflect the percentage of the total number of beverage products by beverage category not the percentage of unit case volume by beverage category unit case volume percentages by beverage category differ from the figures in this chart we are also offering more variety in our serving sizes to help consumers manage their calorie intake and energy balance one example our 75 ounce 90 calorie mini

labeling and education and initiatives that encourage people to live active healthy lifestyles provide front of pack energy calorie information on nearly all of our products by the end of 2011 when that is not possible e g small package size or when such labeling is not allowed by national governments we make that information available online and elsewhere marketing responsibly we have long been a leader in the area of responsible marketing particularly with regard to marketing in media that may be seen or heard by children under age 12 our policy has evolved as media society and our product offerings have evolved but the core of our policy has not we believe parents and caregivers are in the best position to make decisions about what children eat and drink we do not directly target children younger than 12 in our marketing messages or our advertising 2 and we do not show children drinking any of our products outside the presence of a parent or caregiver additionally we do not directly market in primary schools in 2010 we evolved our global responsible marketing policy and redefined the appropriate audience threshold for what constitutes children is programming we shifted the threshold for children is programming from audiences that are more than 50 percent children younger than 12 years of age to audiences that are more than 35 percent children younger than 12 this means we will not buy advertising directly targeted at audiences that are more than 35 percent children younger than 12 our policy applies to all of our beverages and the media outlets we use including television radio print and where data are availableinternet and mobile phones in 2010 we announced and began implementing our global school beverage guidelines as a global businesswe recognize and respect the unique learning environment of schools and believe in commercial free classrooms for children so through our guidelines we have committed not to commercially advertise or offer our beverages in primary schools unless we are requested to do so by a school authority to meet hydration needs to ensure that we are meeting our standards for marketing to children we conduct an audit of our advertising and other marketing materials annually since our last report the 2009 2010 sustainability review we received an encouraging indication that industry self regulation is working when it comes to marketing to children a 2010 analysis by accenture commissioned by the international food beverage alliance showed that with some exceptions the industry is complying with its own policies the study which looked at the practices of eight companies including the coca cola company in markets around the world showed that industry compliance in print and online advertising was 100 percent while industry compliance in television advertising was 96 percent a similar study for the international council of beverages associations which focused on the coca cola company and pepsico inc showed 957 percent compliance in television advertising and 100 percent compliance in print and progress in progress online advertising although we must improve compliance in television advertising these studies affirm that our company and our industry are moving in the right direction the consumer goods forum resolutions on health and wellness in june 2011 we joined other members of the consumer goods forum in adopting three resolutions intended to provide consumers with choices and information that empower them to make decisions to support a healthy life members resolved to provide consumers with choices and information that empower them to make decisions for a healthy life encourage a culture of prevention by promoting active healthy living for all and by engaging with other stakeholders to accelerate and increase the impact of such efforts monitor and learn from efforts and report on progress these resolutions will build upon existing industry initiatives they encourage retailers and manufacturers to further implement self regulatory tools to support healthier diets and lifestyles the next step for the consumer goods forum will be to define implementation plans and metrics for assessing progress in addition to working with our peers in the consumer goods forum we are a founding member of the healthy weight commitment foundation a multiyear effort by the u s food industry to reduce obesity by 2015 2 this means we will not buy advertising directly targeted at audiences that are more than 35 percent children younger than 12 promoting active healthy living one new program we are sponsoring is an international walk to school competition currently being tested in schools in london site of the london 2012 olympic games our plan is to include former olympic cities in this international event with focus on atlanta site of the 1996 olympics as the next pilot based on the belief that walking to school provides an excellent opportunity for increasing physical activity as part of active healthy lifestyles connecting with the community and building social skills the competition will encourage hundreds of schoolchildren to forego cars and buses and instead walk along safe prescribed routes to school along their way to school participants will swipe magnetically striped cards at checkpoints that tell them how far they have walked students who walk the entire route will receive small activity related prizes with a grand prize being awarded to the winning city is students we sponsor more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programs in more than 100 countries around the world our goal is to sponsor at least one program in every country where we operate by the end of 2015 one of our largest longest running and most successful programs is copa coca colatm started in mexico in 1998 and soon expanded to countries worldwide copa coca cola is a program of youth football tournaments in which teams of boys and girls aged 13 to 15 compete at the local state and national levels to determine the top youth football soccer team in a given nation the national tournaments culminate in a world cup style international tournament each summer to date more than 600000 young people have participated in copa coca cola we have also helped the boys girls clubs of america develop triple play to nurture the well being in mindbody and soul of club members the after school program uses education projects and activities to encourage participants to eat a balanced diet become more physically active and engage in healthy relationships a two year study of more than 2000 children ages 9 to 14 showed that triple play succeeded in getting them to exercise more eat in a more balanced way and feel better about themselves the study found that triple play kids increased to 90 percent of the federally recommended amount of daily exercise which is 60 minutes a day for children while their peers outside the program decreased to 78 percent to date triple play has helped more than 1 million children learn the importance of physical activity and proper nutrition because science increasingly shows that physical activity is fundamental to good health we are a founding corporate partner of exercise is medicinetm a global partnership focused on encouraging health care providers to include exercise when designing treatment plans for patients exercise is medicine now has a presence in 25 countries as part of our commitment to promote active healthy living we are helping our associates to become more

uses consistent metrics to monitor performanceemploys activities to identify and mitigate risks and uses tools to drive improvement ensuring the safety and quality of our products has always been at the core of our business and is directly linked to the success of the coca cola company our position on bpa our top priority is to ensure the safety and quality of our products and packaging through rigorous standards that meet or exceed government requirements if we had any concerns about the safety of our packaging we would not use it in recent years some consumers have expressed concern about bisphenol a or bpa which is used in making the lining of our aluminum cans bpa is a chemical used worldwide in making the packages of thousands of products including the coating inside virtually all metal food and beverage cans this coating guards against contamination and extends the shelf life of foods and beverages it also is used to manufacture shatter resistant bottles medical devices sports safety equipment and compact disc covers bpa has been used for more than 50 years while we are very aware of the highly publicized concerns and viewpoints that have been expressed about bpaour point of view is that the scientific consensus on this issue is most accurately reflected in the opinions expressed by those regulatory agencies whose missions and responsibilities are to protect the public is health the consensus repeatedly stated among regulatory agencies in australia canada europe germany japannew zealand and the united states is that current levels of exposure to bpa through food and beverage packaging do not pose a health risk to the general population we will continue to take our guidance on this issue from national and international regulatory authorities and we will take whatever steps are necessary based on sound scientific principles to ensure that any package technology is safe for our consumers looking ahead in many ways we are still learning where our company can make the most meaningful difference in the global fight against obesity we are discovering where our products system and expertise can best add value and are developing meaningful measurements to guide our work we expect to take additional steps in the coming 12 to 24 months to further our six commitments to help address obesity the content of this webpage has been assured by fira please click

company and across the coca cola system we are working to make sure all people are treated with dignity and respect our work in this area is overseen by the public issues and diversity review committee of our board of directors we consider human and workplace rights as articulated in the united nations universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organization is declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work to be inviolable we take a proactive approach to respecting these rights in every workplace of the coca cola company in our bottling system in our supply chain and in the communities in which we operate the foundation of our approach lies in four key documents our human rights statement our workplace rights policy our supplier guiding principles and our global mutual respect policy which we introduced in 2012 all four documents are consistent with the united nations un and international labour organization ilo declarations together they describe our high standards and expectationsaddressing such subjects as freedom of association forced labor child labor the coca cola company gri report discrimination hours of work safetyworkplace security and community and stakeholder engagement our human rights statement our workplace rights policy and our global mutual respect policy apply to all entities in which the coca cola company owns a majority interest many of our larger bottling partners have their own human rights policies for several years we have undertaken the complex work of ensuring that our entire business system and supply chain align with our policies we expect our company our bottling partners and our suppliers to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts as a result of business actions and to address such impacts when they occur furthermore our companybottling partners and suppliers are also responsible for preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts directly linked to their operations products or services by their business relationships to meet these expectations our company bottling partners and suppliers are adopting processes for identifying preventing and mitigating negative impacts on human rights additionally all are required to implement a process for remediation of any adverse human rights impacts they cause or contribute to our efforts to promote respect for human rights across the coca cola system and throughout our supply chain are being recognized in 2011 calvert investments inc announced that we met its environmental

ruggie the former un special representative for business and human rights his protect respect and remedy framework for respecting human rights in a business contextalong with the un guiding principles is now among our primary touchstones as we develop our own programs and practices intro me we world reporting index according to the un guiding principlesany company implementing respect for human rights in a corporate context must put three primary components into place a policy commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights a due diligence process to identifyprevent mitigate and be accountable for human rights abuses processes to enable the remediation of any adverse human rights impacts the company causes or to which it contributes we are implementing all three of these components in our company and are working with our bottling partners and suppliers to help them implement the un guiding principles as well we continually analyze potential and actual human rights impacts across our value chain from raw materials to end use we identify human rights risks along with policies and actions for mitigating them in addition we have developed five human rights related due diligence checklists for managers across our company these easy to use two page checklists cover such topics as migrant labor child labor plant siting and more they offer clear steps our managers can take immediately not only to comply with our policies but also to integrate an ongoing and reflexive respect for human and workplace rights that is inseparable from our daily operations for our bottlers and suppliers we have identified 26 good practices that we encourage them to adopt like the checklists we use in our own companythese practices enable bottlers and suppliers to move beyond legal compliance to the integrated systematic and sustained respect for human rights and workplace rights envisioned in the un guiding principles our support of the un guiding principles builds on our work as a participant in the un global compact and member of the global business initiative on human rights and its predecessor the business leaders initiative on human rights our work in those partnerships continues the coca cola company is perspective on implementation of the un guiding principles on business and human rights has been featured by the business and human rights resource centre as well from employees in our companydown from 426 in 2011 the largest numbers of complaints were related to discrimination which includes retaliation and harassment and work hours and wages we found no instances where freedom of association had been denied in cases where claims are substantiated we take corrective action depending on the violation corrective action may take the form of back payreassignment of duties and in severe cases separation from the company to help our company our bottling partners and our direct suppliers achieve compliance with our policies and principles third party auditors trained in our standards conduct regular workplace assessments we conduct annual assessments of new suppliers and suppliers with a history of noncompliance for suppliers with a history of compliance we conduct assessments every three years more than 15000 workplace assessments have been completed since 2003 aligning our system and suppliers in 2009 we set a goal of ensuring that 98 percent of our company owned and managed facilities meet our workplace rights standards by 2015 we met that goal in 2011 and maintained a 98 percent compliance rate once again in 2012 goal by 2015 achieve a 98 percent compliance level for company owned and managed facilities upholding the standards set in our workplace rights policy also achieve 90 percent compliance with our supplier guiding principles among independent franchise bottling partners and suppliers investigating rights related complaints we require all associates of the coca cola company to know our human rights and workplace rights standards and to apply them in their work managers in particular receive intensive training we also rely on our associates to speak up immediately if they believe our policies have been violated associates can report perceived violations confidentially and without fear of retaliation through numerous channels including our ethicsline a global internet and telephone information and reporting service for associates customerssuppliers and consumers who perceive violations of our code of business conduct our workplace rights policyour global mutual respect policy our human rights statement or applicable laws and regulations we treat all inquiries confidentially and investigate all concerns progress as of december 31 2012 98 percent of our companyowned facilities had achieved compliance we met our goal of 98 percent compliance in 2011 77 percent of our bottling partners and 80 percent of our direct suppliers had achieved compliance intro me we world reporting index as for our suppliers and bottling partners we expect them to comply with the higher standards of international norms and applicable laws with respect to workplace and human rights principles we encourage them to adopt our human rights statement and workplace rights policy or equivalents to comply with our supplier guiding principles and to uphold the standards we have set for everyone doing business with us we convey our expectations and offer compliance assistance through our supplier guiding principles program in 2012 we investigated 412 perceived human and workplace rights complaints the coca cola company gri report we human and workplace rights addressing human and workplace rights in myanmar in 2012 we announced our plans to do business in myanmar for the first time in more than 60 years in 2013 we began production at two bottling plants in the country the beginning of 200 million in investments planned over the next five years that we estimate will create more than 22000 job opportunities through our presence we hope to contribute to myanmar is economic and social success in addition to growing our business our goal is to have 90 percent of our bottling partners and suppliers comply with our supplier guiding principles by 2015 we are making steady progress by the end of 2012 77 percent of bottlers and 80 percent of direct suppliers had met the standards of our supplier guiding principles these represent a 9 point and 7 point increaserespectively in compliance over 2011 reaching deeper into our supply chain one of our ongoing challenges is ensuring respect for human rights and workplace rights far upstream in our supply chain among our second and third tier suppliers and beyond such suppliers can number in the tens of thousands and their operations are often not transparent to us what is more some of our suppliers lacking stakeholder engagement and oversight from government and advocacy groupshave had little incentive to formalize policies and practices related to human and workplace rights to begin to integrate respect for human rights and protection of workplace rights across our supply chain we began piloting a program called pass it back in 2012 the aim of the program is to share our knowledge and best practices related to human and workplace rights with key suppliers and then work with them to pass it back across their supply chains sharing what they have learned with their own suppliers our ultimate aim is to build respect for human rights and the coca cola company gri report protection of workplace rights so that they stretch unbroken from our system back to the farm the forest or wherever the points of origin of our raw materials may be working initially with a fruit supplier a carbon dioxide supplier and a supplier of paper products who collectively represent more than 1 billion in procurement spending we conducted an analysis of each business is human rights impacts and policies we found that all three companies generally lacked policies and awareness in regard to their potential impacts on human and workplace rights we also found that all three were enthusiastic about making improvements and sharing them across the extent of their own supply chain we are now working closely with the companies as they develop their policies and build their capabilities the process can be slow but we believe our approach will ultimately result in greater respect for and protection of human and workplace rights across our supply chain meanwhile we are considering how to expand pass it back to include other suppliers we recognize that some supply chains may be too complex for the program in those cases certification as under the bonsucro standard for sugar may be a more effective tool for ensuring that our suppliers align with our policies and values we human and workplace rights intro me we world reporting index prior to re entering myanmar we conducted the most comprehensive due diligence process in our recent history it included among many other aspectsextensive local stakeholder engagement and a thorough review of human rights issues in the bottling plants we acquiredin the local supply chain and throughout the country as a whole our human rights assessment conducted in october 2012drew upon reports from the u s state department work from the institute for human rights and business and from contracted reports by ul underwriters laboratories inc a global safety science company a team including coca cola personnel and representatives from ul also conducted an in person supplier guiding principles assessment of our two bottling plants spending nearly 450 hours over two weeks surveying the communities bordering the plants as well as two independent distributors the bottling plants we audited scored in the bottom quarter of audited bottlers and suppliers worldwide our assessments revealed issues common in developing economies including genderand age based discrimination hours of work and wage issues and health and safety concerns but rights violations we expected based on our initial researchsuch as child labor were not found audits of a sample of local distribution centers revealed similar issues following the audit we worked with plant managers to implement a remediation plan the plan includes detailed steps for corrective action to be taken in the near medium and long term including continual development of the plants and distributors capacity for aligning with our policies and guidelines we will conduct semiannual follow up assessments until all areas of noncompliance are corrected and annually thereafter until compliance is sustained at that point the sites will be placed on our normal assessment schedule of every one to three yearsdepending on compliance performance in addition to remediation work at the site level we are partnering with local organizations and collaborating with other companies to deliver training on our workplace standards we will sponsor the training which will be delivered by the british council in conjunction with the ilo the trainings will bring together a broad array of supply chain partners by working with other companies we hope to establish the implementation of human and workplace rights safeguards as standard industry practice in myanmar in april 2013 we conducted follow up audits of our two myanmar plantswhich showed that about 24 percent of the identified issues had been addressed of 33 issues identified eight had been fully addressed additional issues also had been addressedbut the plants have not yet achieved full compliance in those areas we recognize that changing some aspects of workplace culture in myanmar will require a great deal of time persistence and collaboration we are optimistic and enthusiastic about the positive contribution we can make to the country is capacity for respecting and protecting human and workplace rights as part of the lifting of u s sanctions against myanmar for human rights violations and in conjunction with the authorization of new licenses permitting investment in the countrythe u s state department required investing companies in myanmar to report annually beginning in 2013 on their human rights due diligence our the coca cola company gri report report which also includes results of our due diligence on

indispensable for economic prosperity and it is essential for our business water is the main ingredient in our beverages central to our manufacturing process and necessary for growing the agricultural products we use as ingredients though we share concern about water sources and increasing water stress in many parts of the world we believe the world contains enough water to meet everyone is needs but only if everyone works together to better manage water resources as a consumer of water and as a company with a presence that is both global and local we have a particular obligation and a unique opportunity to be a responsible steward of water our global system is working to replenish or balance the water used in our finished beverages an estimated 52 percent so far with an ultimate goal of being water neutral by 2020 our system is becoming more efficient in its water use by reducing the amount used per liter of product even as production volumes increase and coca cola bottling plants around the world are recycling wastewater treating it to stringent standards and returning it to nature at a level that supports aquatic 260mm invested in community water projects to date with our partners collaborating to replenish the water we use goal by 2020 safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production we have a particular interest in protecting the water sources that sustain communities because the communities that host our bottling plants are also our consumer base we sell our products where we make them if those communities stay strong our business will stay strong if the watersheds we share with them are conserved those communities and our business can thrive so in addition to the ethical and

report additionally information about specific water stewardship work at bottling plants and communities across our system can be found in reports issued by our bottling partners the challenge of sustaining water balance while we are energized by our success to date we recognize that we have much more to do if we are to meet our goal of replenishing the water we use by 2020 and meeting that goal is only a first step we also intend to continue to balance the water we use over time a complex and neverending challenge sustaining water balance will require us to continue to treat all process wastewater even as our business grows and as government regulation of treatment becomes stricter in some parts of the world in order to sustain this commitment we will need to replenish more water to balance our water use as our business grows and it will require us to sustain the outcomes of our community water projects through monitoring and evaluation to ensure that those projects continue to deliver the intended benefits to people and nature intro corporate water stewardship exploring me the utility and practical application of we the water footprint methodology for world understanding

water efficiency 59 percent since 2010 and 214 percent since 2004 we have made steady progress in improving our water efficiency which we define as the amount of water we use per liter of product between 2004 and 2011 we met our initial goal of improving water efficiency system wide by 20 percent compared to a 2004 baseline our new goal is to improve efficiency by 25 percent over our 2010 water use ratio of 226 liters of water used per liter of product produced the coca cola company gri report understanding our water footprint water footprinting an approach to assess the total volume of water used to produce a product is helping us extend our view of how we use water across our supply chain our studies have shown that around 80 percent of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural supply chain as a founding partner of the water footprint network we have worked with wwf conservation international and others to assess the water embedded in our product ingredients so we can better understand the implications for our business and work to reduce impacts in collaboration with the nature conservancy in 2010 we issued a report product water footprint assessments practical application in world water the largest portion of the product water footprints assessed as part of these studies came from the fieldnot the factory which demonstrated significant opportunity to engage more directly with our agricultural suppliers in advancing more sustainable water use guided in part by these assessmentsto date we have focused studies on the blue green and grey water footprints of sugar beets orange juice and coca cola to help us pinpoint potential sustainability impacts in specific watersheds we expect to increasingly assess not just the quantity of the water used to grow our product ingredientsbut the impact of that use as well understanding impact is importantbecause large water footprints can be sustainable in water rich areaswhile very small water footprints might compromise sustainability in places where water is scarce gaining a clear understanding of impacts makes good environmental sense and provides us with better guidance for prioritizing areas of concern coca cola europe has proposed a methodology for water footprint sustainability assessments that considers impacts as well as water quantity also please refer to the sustainable agriculture section of our sustainability report for more details on our efforts with suppliers mitigating water risk for communities and for our system an inventory of relevant

extent of the local watershed and surface water system basic descriptions of the local hydrogeology and groundwater resources and a map of the local groundwater resources and groundwater basin progress in progress by the end of 2012 788 of the 863 bottling plants in our system 91 had completed source vulnerability assessments and 587 plants had begun implementation of source water protection plans work on this goal began in 2008 due to challenges in obtaining data ongoing discussions with stakeholders and the sheer volume of work requiredsome plants have not yet met our goal we aim for all plants to have source water protection programs in place by the end of 2013 a review of available water quality data and known current and historical water quality issues a conceptual hydrologic model for the watershed and groundwater basin models include a water balance calculation and account for inputs such as rain and outputs such as withdrawals and evaporation to mitigate water related risks to our system and to the communities we serve we have required every one of our system is 863 bottling plants to conduct a local source vulnerability assessment or sva we also require a water source sustainability assessment as part of the due diligence process when we acquire land for a new plant or purchase a business with existing manufacturing plants these assessments inventory the socialenvironmental and political risks to the water sources supplying our facilities and the surrounding communities svas include the following elements among others a water scarcity evaluation that identifies current water stress and drought conditions an evaluation of the potential for natural disasters and security issues to threaten the facility is source water an evaluation of how the facility is water use could limit the availability and quality of water for people in the local community an assessment of the facility is wastewater treatment system and its effectiveness in removing known and suspected contaminants along with an assessment of the potential impact our wastewater discharge could have on the surrounding ecosystem and community intro me we world reporting index the svas performed to date show that water quality is a ubiquitous concern in communities where we do business water scarcity increasing competition for water and infrastructure reliability have also been commonly cited in some locations policy economic and social risks can be more challenging to assess and lack of watershed data is a common barrier to completing robust technical assessments svas sometimes deliver good news we have seen that in some communitiespublic sector water managers are investing in risk mitigation planning and water sustainability resiliency indicating risks that are lower than we estimated prior to assessment from assessment to action once bottling plants have completed their svas we require them to develop and implement a comprehensive swpp detailing specific risk mitigation actions and deadlines for completing them plans address challenges at a description of the physical water resource system from the water source s to the facility is water treatment system including groundwater surface water and ocean water an inventory of water resource management agencies and their policies regulations planning priorities and enforcement activities

and improving water sources because many issues identified in an sva are concerns shared among many if not all water users in a given watershed we use our findings to engage governmentslocal communities businesses and civil society and plan for collaborative action we required that our company owned bottling facilities and independent bottling partners conduct svas for each bottling plant location and develop swpps by the end of 2012 we confirm compliance with this requirement through a formal governance process as of the end of 2012 approximately 91 percent 788 plants of 863 had completed svas and developed swpps nearly 70 percent of our global manufacturing system 587 of 863 plants have begun implementation of swpps with the balance to begin implementation in 2013 though work on this goal began in 2008 and good progress has been made to date challenges in obtaining dataongoing discussions with stakeholders and the sheer volume of work required have impeded the progress of some plants in our system of the plants that did not meet our deadline many are in the final stages of completion through our governance processes our system is senior leaders are working with plants to implement corrective action plans and bring them into alignment with our goal governance ensures not only that assessments and planning are conducted but also that swpps are implemented as more plants in our system move from assessment and planning to implementation of their plans we will detail their progress in future reports treating and recycling wastewater goal by the end of 2010 return to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life the water we use in our system operations through comprehensive wastewater treatment progress in progress we aspire to treat all wastewater from our manufacturing processes as of the end of 2012 we had achieved 98 percent alignment with our wastewater treatment standards we reduce our impact on water systems and contribute to improved water quality by treating wastewater before returning it to the environment our stringent treatment process ensures that the wastewater we discharge meets and in many cases exceeds standards set by local regulations in some countrieswe have introduced the very first wastewater treatment facility in 2012our system released approximately 160 billion liters of treated wastewater in 2006 we set the goal that by the end of 2010 all water used in our system operations would be discharged at a level that supports aquatic life we identified that level through a three part process returned 160b liters through treated wastewater 98 98 facility alignment with our wastewater standards working with experts from outside our system we evaluated aquatic toxicology science to determine how varying concentrations of certain water quality parameters acidity alkalinitybiological oxygen demand etc affect aquatic life we reviewed wastewater regulations from around the world to see how governments were addressing those same parameters our system has invested 1b over the last decade in our wastewater treatment initiatives we identified what was in our wastewater by analyzing several samples of untreated wastewater from different operations across our system we then combined all of our information to arrive at the maximum allowable concentrations for each parameter the coca cola

build synergies as they seek to equally ensure waterenergy and food security for everyone already many of our water projects are helping communities mitigate and adapt to the impacts associated with the intersections of water energy and food for example some projects increase the ability of watersheds to absorb threats associated with increasingly severe weather events and help build resilience in response to the higher demands for water energy and food others focus on increasing crop yields to meet the needs of a growing population while reducing the impacts on water sources through water body alterations aquifer the coca cola company gri report 60mm gallons of water are collected for use each year by 1000 syrup drums donated in 2012 for reuse as rain barrels in communities across the u s also we have extended our water stewardship efforts beyond our bottling plants and local water sources to our agricultural supply chain one of the largest in the world because embedded water associated with our products is much greater at the farm than in our own operations we are helping our suppliers improve efficiency and reduce their water use some examples of our work to date world water we are partnering with earth university and our supplier ticofrut to promote sustainable citrus production in costa rica in the united states we are collaborating with multiple partners to help farmers and ranchers use water more efficiently with the aim of improving flow and water quality in rivers in arizona georgia michiganmississippi and utah we are working in partnership with cargill incorporated and wwf on a sustainable corn project intended to improve the livelihoods of farmers and protect biodiversity by improving yields reducing waste conserving water protecting wetlands and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture in jilin province china in all we have contributed to sustainable agriculture initiatives in 25 countries helping farmers protect water increase crop yields and reduce environmental impacts and we plan to do more an important priority for the company going forward is to work with major suppliers retail customers and commercial partners to help advance their water management and optimize their water efficiency in the context of the water food energy nexus you can read more about our sustainable agriculture initiatives and our efforts to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions all of which we are increasingly undertaking with water stewardship in mind by visiting the links below for 2012 and 2013 we also engage directly with 2030

water resources group is work in the organization is most recent annual report stakeholder engagement and the social license for water use our stake in local water sources is just one of many for us to do business and to be part of the solutions addressing water stress it is essential for us to secure the trust and goodwill of the people in the communities where we operate such trust can only come from candid continual dialogue an ongoing conversation in which we show residents how much water we are using how we are using it and what we are doing to improve water sourceswhile carefully listening and seeking to understand residents specific concerns about water if they are to be effective our efforts to protect local water sources must involve collaboration with local stakeholdersincluding governments community members water agencies ngos world water and others as our bottling partners implement their swpps they engage local stakeholders and collaborate on solutions that serve local communities and ecosystems as well as our business intro me we world reporting index in 2012 we used the ceres aqua gauge a methodology and tool that assesses corporate water management based on both internal and external information a full assessment of our water strategy was conducted against leading practices to identify strengths and areas for improvement and formulate recommendations an increased focus on our engagement with customers on water stewardship and water stewardship within our supply chain were key areas for improvement as we work to reset our sustainability goals in 2013 the aqua gauge assessment is helping inform new commitments in 2009 we worked with the environmental law institute to produce a guide to stakeholder engagement for improved water stewardship the guide is intended to help our bottling partners identify stakeholders facilitate the engagement process prioritize issuesunderstand regulatory requirementsand forge productive partnershipsamong other objectives the guide also provides a suite of tools for stakeholder engagement and promotes stakeholder engagement according to five core principles transparency inclusivenessrepresentivity accountability and respect see the section of this report entitled how we quantify replenishment an evolving methodology for important qualifying information and perspective on our work to estimate water replenishment and other water related benefits we define water neutral as the point where we are returning the water we use back to communities by treating all wastewater and returning it to the environment at a level of purity that supports aquatic life and replenishing an amount of water equivalent to our product volume through locally relevant water projects sustainable packaging consumers but also are efficiently produced and readily recovered or recycled packaging plays an essential role for our business in meeting consumer needs and preventing waste by protecting our products during delivery in factinside every one of our bottles and in our cans and other packages too is the story of a company trying to make its packaging more environmentally and economically sustainable we work to deliver the quality beverages our consumers expect in the most efficient way possible with a key focus on recyclabilityminimizing resources and increasing the use of recycled and renewable materials additionally we support programs that encourage consumers to recycle used beverage packaging approximately 85 percent of our unit case volume is delivered in recyclable bottles and cans and because the majority of our packaging is fully recyclable we are working to maintain and grow this percentage as we do sowe consider environmental concerns along with our need to protect the safety and quality of our products and to transport them efficiently we also take into account the different preferences of consumers around the world by taking into account all aspects of packaging development from raw materials and development to transport and recovery we are able to mitigate risks in production that could both erode our profitability and negatively impact our brand equity such risks include cost fluctuations or supply chain disruption of packaging materials such as petroleum or aluminum and also potentially being viewed as a contributor to global pollution even though a significant percentage of our packages are recovered and recycled all in allour strategic approach to developing more sustainable packaging enables us to meet the needs of our consumers and reduce our business risk along with our impact on the environment beyond our own cans and bottles an ambitious new recovery goal our beverage containers are recovered through industry financed collection organizations through communitybased and government programs and through our system directly they are also recovered by informal collectors we are working to increase recovery rates across all of these channels in 2012 we helped to recover 371 million pounds of aluminum and pet plastic containers in the united states and canada alone in 2009 we set the goal of recovering bottles and cans equivalent to 50 percent of those that we send to market annually while we have made solid progress toward that goal through our longtime support of community recycling programs precise measurement of recovery rates has been hampered by a lack of available data many communities especially in developing and emerging markets do not collect recovery data also there is no practical mechanism for tracking the collection of packaging by the millions of informal collectors that operate in every market in which we distribute our products based on available data we estimate that to date we are recovering 39 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans that we send to market intro me we world reporting index in july 2013 to improve recovery trackingand to raise the bar for our system and for communities worldwide we announced our new goal of achieving a 75 percent recovery rate for the number of bottles and cans equivalent to what we introduce in developed markets by 2020 currently the recovery rate in developed markets is estimated at 50 percent while that rate is moving in the right directionit is not enough we believe to achieve our goal of improved environmental and economic sustainability working to make our packaging more sustainable is more than just the right thing to do it is smart business we work to employ sustainable packaging innovations that not only delight the coca cola company gri report world sustainable packaging market and enable us to better set targets for improved recovery rates we are working to have the rtm rolled out in all markets by the end of 2013 we are working toward recovery of 75 percent of all bottles and cans in these markets australia austria belgium bulgaria canada

portugal slovakia slovenia south korea spain sweden switzerland taiwan united states moving all of our developed markets toward a 75 percent recovery rate will require an enormous effort from everyone businesses governmentsnongovernmental organizations ngos and of course consumers we intend to provide leadership that helps bring all sectors of society together to advance progress we know a 75 percent recovery rate is attainable in developed markets based on markets like japan and belgium that have already achieved or exceeded it we will work with multiple recovery channels including municipal recycling programs industry recovery efforts and our own direct recovery initiatives to meet our new goal we will work in 36 developed markets to increase recovery and recycling rates we are also working with other companies and with local organizations worldwide to identify and compile independently verified recovery and recycling data so that we can establish authoritative baseline information on current recovery rates we intend to help improve recovery rates in developing markets as well we are working to first establish solid baseline information a more challenging task in developing marketsbefore setting a global goal we will set that goal by 2015 in select markets in latin america the asia pacific region eurasia and africawe are piloting our new recovery tracking methodology or rtm our rtm involves locating credible sources of recovery data in each market and then assigning one of three quality levels to each data set we expect our new methodology to substantially improve data validation increase our baseline understanding of recycling in each the coca cola company gri report as we progress toward our new 2020 goal we are as committed as ever to achieving our original goal of recovering bottles and cans equivalent to 50 percent of those that we introduce into the marketplace annually by 2015 supporting community based programs worldwide goal by 2015 recover 50 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans used annually progress in progress we estimate that 39 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans we send to market are recovered to promote recycling and increase recovery rates the coca cola system also supports numerous litter prevention programs and community organizations including through the coca cola foundation following are some of the programs and organizations we support happy recycling machine coca cola singapore brought together government civil society and a very special vending machine to help increase recycling rates across the country when consumers placed their empty plastic beverage bottles in the machine they received an award for being environmentally responsible the campaign collected 51827 world sustainable packaging recycled bottles while educating the public on the importance of supporting environmental sustainability keep america beautiful we helped found the nonprofit organization keep america beautiful 60 years ago and our support continues a grant from the coca cola foundation to keep america beautiful allowed 25000 single stream curbside recycling carts to be donated to the city of chicago the grant was matched by a commitment from the coca cola company to provide an additional 25000 carts over the next five years the carts will be part of the city is overall deployment to 600000 households which is expected to significantly raise recycling rates in the windy city intro me we world reporting index project recover project recoveran initiative supported by the coca

recycling a part of our company is north america group is working with envipco to pilot reimagine beverage containers recycling centerswhich provide interactive collection kiosks to encourage recycling more than 13 million containers have been recycled since the reimagine pilot program launched in the dallas fort worth area in late 2010 on average each week more than 1500 consumers bring their cans and pet plastic bottles to the recycling center and more than 1 million cans and bottles are recycled each month read more about our support of community recycling programs around the world in the charitable giving section of this report inspiring more consumers to recycle millions of consumers worldwide have adopted the recycling habit still many of our plastic bottles and one third of our cans are not recycled to help increase recycling rates we are working to invent creative ways to engage with consumers following are just some of our efforts from 2012 and 2013 ekocycle in july 2012 we launched the ekocycle program a collaboration with musical artist and producer will i am and other consumer brands ekocycle is a stand alone brand initiative dedicated to helping encourage recycling and sustainability among consumers through the marketing of lifestyle products made in part from recycled material the ekocycle initiative aims to educate consumers about everyday recycling choices and empower their decisions to purchase products made in part from recycled products ekocycle educates consumers about waste that can be repurposed into recycled content for fashionable and valuable lifestyle products it also encourages demand for recycled materials and reinforces the importance of recycling watch a video about ekocycle happiness recycled collaborating with zero waste scotland we connected with more than 18000 people and got our message out to 160000 more through promotions at four events in france and great britain during the summer of 2013 using fun interactive recycling bins designed by animators and cheering on recyclers with a pompon squad we encouraged showgoers to recycle their bottles and cans then we gave them souvenir photos and temporary tattoos to remind them to recycle after the event using social media during and after we spread the word well beyond the show is groundsinspiring consumers through twitterfacebook and more the promotion was more than just a good time in a postevent survey 22 percent of those we connected with said they were recycling the coca cola company gri report more watch a video about happiness recycled london 2012 olympic games as a worldwide partner of the olympic movement and the longest continuous sponsor of the games we wanted to help make the london 2012 olympic games the most sustainable games of modern times as part of that effortwe helped implement a zero waste infrastructure including waste and recycling bins designed and positioned to maximize recovery rates we also reached beyond the olympic venues to place 260 new recycling bins around london the bins on oxford street alone now collect over 1 metric ton of recyclable waste each day in addition our bottler coca cola enterprises collaborated with waste reprocessor eco plastics to fast track plans for a major new bottle to bottle recycling facility in lincolnshire england this 15 million investment more than doubled the amount of bottle grade recycled plastic rpet available in great britain and enabled us to commit to recycling all clear pet bottles from games venues and turn them back into new bottles within six weeks we also sought to inspire more people to recycle during the 70 day olympic torch relay around the uk with a distinctive recycle to the beat hybrid vehicle to make recycling more fun all of the approximately 15 million pet plastic bottles we collected throughout the games were reprocessed and back on the shelves of british retailers within six weeks watch a video about our recycling program at the london 2012 olympic games continued collaboration in reducing marine debris when used packaging is not disposed of properly it too often ends up littering the world is waterways our packaging is among the marine debris that can be found on shorelines around the worldso we are addressing the matter of marine debris in earnest world sustainable packaging we work with a number of organizations including ocean conservancy to better understand the causes of marine debris togetherwe are gathering science based information and engaging other companies in developing sustainable solutions intro me we world reporting index in 2011 working with ocean conservancy we helped launch the trash free seas alliance a group of diverse businesses ngos scientific institutions and community groups that share the common goal of eliminating ocean trash by bringing these groups together we hope to speed restoration of the world is seas in 2013 we worked with the trash free seas alliance to host knowledge sharing sessions that highlighted the threat of marine debris including a presentation from conservation international on the ocean health index we have also partnered with ocean conservancy for the past 18 years as a sponsor of the international coastal cleanup the world is largest volunteer effort for ocean health each year coca cola system associates are among the more than 500000 volunteers who help clean up the world is waterways during the event using more recycled and renewable materials goal source 25 percent of our pet plastic from recycled or renewable material by 2015 progress in progress five percent of our packaging materials currently comes from recycled or renewable materials approximately 60 percent of our total beverage volume is sold in plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate better known as pet plastic driving demand for pet plastic is a consumer preference for packaging that is lighter in weight shatter resistantresealable and easily recyclable in addition pet plastic enables us to improve resource efficiency while maintaining our commitment to exceptional beverage quality in 2009 we set a goal of sourcing 25 percent of our pet plastic for bottles from recycled and renewable materials by 2015 in 2009 to help meet that goal we introduced our breakthrough plantbottletm packaging program plantbottle packaging is helping to make pet packaging more sustainable by making the bottle with up to 30 percent of plant based material continuing with our commitment to rpet in the early 1990s we became the first company to use food grade recycled pet plastic known as rpet in packaging our enabling of rpet related research began decades before that we recognized early that creating end markets for recycled pet plastic would be critical to our bottle recovery efforts and to the success of pet plastic as packaging material today we are still working to increase the amount of rpet in our packaging but we have encountered challenges over the last decade demand for rpet has increased significantly demand for rpet fiber used to make clothing and other non food products is particularly high and while increased demand is a positive development for the rpet market greater demand has also driven up prices and reduced supply in addition food grade rpet requires more processing and commands a premium over non food grade rpet making it even more of a challenge for us to costeffectively incorporate more rpet in our packages our strategy to help increase recycling and recovery of pet bottles and thus increase the supply of rpet while developing innovations like plantbottle which requires fewer nonrenewable ingredients than conventional pet plastic meanwhilewe remain committed to using rpet in our packaging as it makes sense economically our system has invested the coca cola company gri report in six bottle to bottle facilities that improve our capacity for using rpet in the united states we recently worked with rpet suppliers to reach agreement on more favorable terms for rpet stock additionally we continue to invest in the exploration of technologies and recovery systems that could enable more efficient and cost effective production of food grade rpet and because the use of rpet is approved in just a limited number of countries we are working with governments of the nations where we do business to remove legal barriers to the use of recycled materials in beverage packaging bringing plantbottle to scale because innovative technology is most meaningful when it is widely adoptedwe have worked steadily toward our goal of using plantbottle for all of our pet packaging by 2020 at the end of 2012 we had distributed more than 14 billion plantbottle packages in 24 countries in 2012 we expanded plantbottle packaging into such countries as serbia south korea and india in existing plantbottle markets like the united states canada mexico and brazil we expanded the number of brands using plantbottle packaging we distributed approximately 7 billion plantbottle packages during the calendar year ending december 31 2012 approximately 6 percent of the total new pet plastic used by the coca cola company contains our first generation plantbottle packaging material we remain focused on building out our supply chain to meet our goal of plantbottle packaging comprising 100 percent of the new pet plastic we use by 2020 we expect our use of plantbottle packaging to be a key contributor to achievement of our goal to reduce carbon dioxide co2 emissions embedded in the drink in your hand by 25 percent by 2020 already our use of plantbottle packaging has eliminated the need for the equivalent of more than 300000 barrels of oil world sustainable packaging and helped to save the equivalent emissions of approximately 130000 metric tons of co2 the amount of co2 emitted annually from more than 27000 passenger vehicles intro me we world reporting index advancing innovation through increased adoption of plantbottle packaging to accelerate supplier interest and investment in plantbottle packagingwe are enabling other companies to have access to the technology in 2011 we entered into a partnership with h j heinz company to put its ketchup in plantbottle packaging so far more than 164 million bottles of heinz ketchup in plantbottle packages have been distributed throughout north america we will continue to explore the potential for similar partnerships building a foundation of trust transparent environmental and social performance measures developed in collaboration with credible partnersare at the foundation of our plantbottle packaging program because plantbottle packaging is made from sugarcane waste sustainable cultivation and harvesting of sugarcane are among our chief concerns issues such as water consumption land use impacts on biodiversity and child labor are all pertinent because such concerns are rarely addressed by typical packaging lifecycle assessment tools we have built on our company is existing sustainable agriculture program and engaged with partners such as world wildlife fund to help advance our understanding of how to identify and select sustainably sourced feedstocks we have also worked to ensure that the program does not adversely affect local food security and we are investing in research to advance technologies that use agricultural residues or wastes to help us continue to grow plantbottle packaging more sustainably toward the bottle of the future currently up to 30 percent of the material used in plantbottle packaging comes from plants in some markets 62 the plant based content may be less where we also include recycled content in the bottle we are limited to 30 percent because currently commercial technologies only exist for making one of the two ingredients in pet plastic our ultimate goal is to develop pet plastic that is 100 percent plant based in 2011 we announced multimillion dollar investments in three innovation companies that have technology solutions for replacing the other ingredient in pet plastic and can help turn our 100 percent vision into reality in the coming years to further drive progress we created a plant pet technology collaborative in 2012 our fellow members of the collaborative are ford motor companyh j heinz company nike inc and the procter gamble company by leveraging the combined efforts of these companies in ways that are consistent with applicable antitrust competition law rules the collaborative is hoping to speed development of a completely plant based pet material read more or watch a video about plantbottle packaging what it is made of and much more achieving greater efficiency through lightweighting to date we have trimmed the weight of our 20 ounce pet plastic bottle by more than 25 percent shaved 30 percent from the weight of our 12 ounce aluminum can lightened our 8 ounce glass bottle by more than 50 percent lightweighting is often a market bymarket effort for example our bottling partner in puerto rico has developed a 500 milliliter bottle for dasani water that weighs 98 grams the lightest bottle in our system we are working to top that by developing an 8 gram bottle that we hope to introduce globally in 2014 smarter packaging for a smaller carbon footprint goal by 2015 improve packaging material efficiency per liter of product sold by 7 percent compared with a 2008 baseline in july 2013 we announced our 2020 goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by 25 percent packaging is the largest contributor to our carbon emissions making up 38 percent of our co2 as of 2010 our baseline year for our new goal our system is efforts to design more efficient packagingemploy more renewable material and increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging is expected to make a significant contribution toward reducing our carbon footprint progress on track between 2008 and 2012 we improved packaging material efficiency per liter of product sold by 7 percent for at least 85 percent of our packaging volume we intend to maintain or improve upon that level between now and our target year of 2015 intro me we world reporting index to protect our products and ensure their safe transport to consumers in 2008 we set the goal of improving the packaging material efficiency per liter of our product sold by 7 percent by 2015 we are proud to have achieved that goal for at least 85 percent of our packaging volume including packages made from glass refillable pet plastic one way glass pet aluminum and steel we intend to maintain or increase our 7 percent improvement in efficiency between now and our goal year of 2015 looking ahead joining the circular economy 100 in early 2013 we joined the ellen macarthur foundation in launching the circular economy 100 a three year program aimed at bringing together leading global companies to facilitate projects promoting a global circular economy an industrial economy that is by design or intention restorative the circular economy 100 will provide executive education and insight on key themes and

cola is the commitment of a company that is deeply concerned about climate change our concern is based on the scientific consensus that global climate change is occurring and that human caused greenhouse gas emissions are a contributing factor the implications of climate change on our planet are profound and wideranging public health agriculturebiodiversity and water sources may all be negatively affected the potential effects on people communities and ecosystems are sobering to consider and demand immediate action of course climate change also poses risks to our business as well more frequent and intense droughts and floods can harm global agriculturelimiting the supply or increasing the cost of ingredients we use in our products extreme weather could impair our bottling plants disrupt our supply chain and affect consumer demand perhaps most seriously climate change could significantly limit water resources for our operations for our supply chain and for the communities we serve our system generates greenhouse gas emissions by consuming energy through manufacturing by consuming fuel in our global delivery fleet and by chilling our products for optimum refreshment our broader supply chain which includes the manufacturing of our packaging and the farming that grows our ingredientsgenerates millions of additional tons of greenhouse gases growing our business without increasing greenhouse gas emissions the coca cola company gri report is a tall order but it is a process we are committed to we have made progress but like much of the world we need to do more and soon following is an overview of our progress from 2012 and a look at where we are heading in 2013 and beyond intro me we world reporting index an ambitious new goal for reducing carbon in our value chain goal reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by 25 percent by 2020 progress new we are working to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain of our products by making comprehensive reductions across our manufacturing processespackaging formats delivery fleetrefrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing in july 2013 we joined our longtime partner world wildlife fund wwf in announcing a number of new environmental goals among them a commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our beverages by 25 percent by 2020 this new goal complements our existing goals for 2015 our new goal stems from the recognition that to make a meaningful difference we must reduce emissions generated by not only our bottling plants and distribution fleet but also our entire value chain including agriculturepackaging and refrigeration an initial analysis showed that in our baseline year of 2010 our value chain emitted approximately 59 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and only about 52 million metric tons came from manufacturing we estimate that achieving our new goal will enable us to prevent more than 20 million metric tons of co2 emissions by 2020 that is four times our system is annual carbon emissions from manufacturing and the equivalent of taking 38 million cars off the road for a year world climate protection this new goal is ambitious and is among the most progressive climaterelated commitments from any company to ensure that we succeedwe will collaborate with our partners and suppliers and continue to move forward with energy efficiency and climate protection initiatives already under way across our system this work includes continuing to improve the sustainability of our packaging through design optimization and the increased use of recycled and renewable materials such as plantbottle packaging improving the energy efficiency of our cooling equipment committing to more sustainable sourcing of key ingredients incorporating more fuel efficient modes of product delivery improving energy efficiency within our manufacturing operations phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons hfcs in all new cold drink equipment increasing our use of clean energy to help us reach our new goal we are developing annual reduction targets for the next seven years and working with our supplier partners to find ways of meeting them we are also developing processes for measuring progress and we are equipping climate ambassadors who will champion our goal systemwide and provide training the coca cola company gri report and other assistance to help our company bottlers and suppliers strive to reduce emissions a 3 percent increase in manufacturing emissions in 2012 goal grow our business but not our systemwide carbon emissions from manufacturing operations through 2015 compared with a 2004 baseline progress off track our global manufacturing emissions in 2012 were 12 million metric tons lower than the business as usual forecast for 2012 however total absolute emissions were 3 percent higher than emissions from 2011 and now stand 15 percent higher than our 2004 baseline in 2008 we set the goal of growing our business but not our systemwide carbon emissions from manufacturing operations through 2015 our manufacturing sites emitted 548 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2012 a 3 percent increase over 2011 that number puts us 15 percent higher than our 2004 baseline and off track for reaching our goal of bringing emissions levels back down to that baseline by 2015 we consider this upward trend to be both disappointing and unacceptable we are working diligently to reduce emissions through a variety of measures including expanded use of clean energy world climate protection though our manufacturing related emissions increased in 2012 our emissions intensity the ratio of emissions to production volume improved by nearly 2 percent over 2011 in all our emissions intensity has improved 19 percent since 2004 even with our year over year increase in emissions in 2012 our emissions are still 12 million metric tons lower than business as usual forecasts for the year we have successfully slowed growth in emissions relative to volume now we are aiming to stop andultimately reverse it intro me we world reporting index emissions in developed countries down 8 percent since 2004 goal by 2015 reduce emissions from our manufacturing operations in developed countries by 5 percent compared to our 2004 baseline progress on track in 2012emissions from our manufacturing operations in developed countries were 8 percent below our 2004 baseline in 2012 our emissions from manufacturing operations in developed countries increased slightly about 2 percent compared to 2011 even somanufacturing related emissions in developed countries are approximately 8 percent lower than our 2004 baselinekeeping us well on track toward our goal of a 5 percent reduction by 2015 we are bringing emissions down in part through our continuing work with bottlers on the top 10 energy saving challenge the program developed with wwf and launched in 2011 equips bottlers and plant managers with 10 high return low risk energy saving practices they can readily implement each practice delivers high financial return and contributes significantly toward achieving our climate targets to date 526 of our system is nearly 900 manufacturing facilities are implementing the practices a total of 127 facilities have completed the entire top 10 challenge and more than 270 improved energy efficiency for eight consecutive years using energy more efficiently enables us to reduce our carbon footprint conserve natural resources and contain costs the total amount of energy consumed by manufacturing sites across our system has grown as our business has grown from 544 billion megajoules in 2004 to 624 billion megajoules in 2012 but our energy efficiency ratio the amount of megajoules used per liter of product has continuously improved have made at least 80 percent progress in september 2012 the united states environmental protection agency recognized coca cola refreshments usa inc the company is bottling and customer service organization for north america with a green power leadership award for its agreement to generate energy from a 65 megawatt combined heat and power system at an atlanta facility this cogeneration plant captures methane gas from a nearby landfill and converts it to clean burning fuel the plant generates at least 48 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually resulting in an emissions reduction of approximately 20000 metric tons of co2 per year equivalent to the co2 emissions from the electricity use of more than 4000 average sized homes per year at our company headquarters in atlanta georgia our informationthe coca cola company gri report intro me we world reporting index technology staff are working to limit co2 emissions from powering our corporate data centers even as the load on our computer servers increases in 2013we completed an upgrade of 30 air handlers in one of our data centers we expect this improvement to reduce our co2 emissions by an estimated 650 metric tons annually the equivalent of taking 90 cars off the road as we make steady progress toward our goal for developed countries we are also working hard to reduce emissions in developing countries one example hindustan coca cola beverages private limited hccbpl our largest bottling partner in india has committed to expand the amount of energy it draws from

equivalent to the electricity used by over 464000 homes energy efficient colddrink equipment saves our customers money too an estimated 440 million per year in 2012 to help our manufacturing facilities continue to improve energy efficiency we developed 20 step by step guidelines to implementing energysaving actions and shared them with our bottlers we also upgraded our internal website dedicated to strategies for saving energy and our system held more than 20 workshops on increasing energy efficiency improving packaging to reduce our carbon footprint packaging is the largest contributor to our potential carbon emissions making up 38 percent of our co2 emissions as of 2010 our system is efforts to design more efficient packaging use more renewable packaging material and increase the amount of recycled content will make a significant contribution toward reducing our carbon footprint the coca cola company gri report world climate protection 14 percent decrease in our

support of relevant public policy and cross sector initiatives that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the climate and communities worldwide world climate protection sustainable agriculture inside every bottle of coca cola indeed in most of our products are ingredients that get their start on a farm we buy many tons of sugar fruit corn tea coffee and other ingredients every year our business depends on the long term availability of these products at the same time the future of the planet may depend on crops being grown more sustainably as our longtime partner world wildlife fund wwf and others note unsustainable agricultural practices have serious impacts on people and the environment according to wwf agriculture uses about 69 percent of the world is fresh water it is the leading source of pollution in many countries a primary driver of deforestation and one of the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change half the planet is topsoil has vanished over the last 150 years due in part to poor farming practices in our value chain agriculture accounts for the largest share of water use and the third largest share of carbon emissionsafter packaging and refrigeration if growers are to provide the food necessary to support the over 9 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2050 they must find ways to make agriculture more efficient and aligned with ecological limits and change must happen soon promoting agricultural sustainability is also a socioeconomic imperative agriculture is the world is largest industryproducing 13 trillion in food annually and employing over 1 billion people for three quarters of the world is extremely poor people farming is the only viable way to make a living farming in the 21st century must protect the rights and the coca cola company gri report intro me we world reporting index livelihoods of agricultural workers and support strong healthy communities accountability for our impact all the way to the farm level for all of these reasons we have worked with our suppliers for several years to make our supply chain more sustainable in 2012 and 2013 our work took a major stride forward following is a look at our progress to guide progress toward our new goal we have established sustainable agriculture guiding principles for our suppliers these principles define what we mean when we refer to more sustainable sourcing articulate our expectations and set criteria for human and workplace rights environmental stewardship and farm management we are working with suppliers and with wwf to implement the guidelines throughout our system in april 2013we asked suppliers to provide action plans for meeting our sustainability criteria along with baselines for where they currently stand in relation to our goal we will evaluate their plans and work collaboratively to set a path toward achieving our goal of sustainably sourcing key agricultural ingredients by 2020 an ambitious new goal for sustainable sourcing throughout 2012 our system collaborated with wwf and other partners to develop a goal that we believe is both bold and achievable to sustainably source key agricultural ingredients by 2020 these ingredients include cane sugar beet sugar highfructose starch based syrup primarily corn tea coffee palm oil soy pulp and paper fiber oranges lemons grapesapples and mangoes we set this new goal for a few reasons first sustainable sourcing can ensure continuity in our supply of safehigh quality raw materials reducing business risk and delivering sustainable business value for us and for our supply chain partners just as importantsustainable sourcing is essential if we are serious about improving our environmental economic and social impacts as the footprint of agriculture in our supply chain exceeds that of our system is operations and increasinglycustomers consumers environmental partners and other stakeholders expect us to demonstrate end to end world sustainable agriculture our new goal is a significant step in the shift toward more sustainable sourcing that we and our suppliers have been making for several years some of our suppliers already comply with many if not all of our guiding principles in the coming months we will identify the best existing sustainability practices among our suppliers and encourage their application across our supply chain we plan to begin validating suppliers for compliance in 2015 and are working with internal stakeholders suppliers and partner organizations to establish details on the assurance process we expect our guiding principles to ultimately have the greatest impact at the farm level where we believe some of the greatest strides toward sustainability can be made but working to change the practices of hundreds of small scale farmers such as those in the coffee and sugarcane industries presents challenges and the process will take time we are working with nongovernmental organizations ngos and other partners around the world to develop the best ways of connecting and collaborating with farmers as more of our suppliers adopt sustainable practices we will work with them to find a fair balance in the prices we pay for ingredients we expect to take a preference not premium approach rewarding suppliers who comply with our guiding principles sooner by strengthening our business with them we also want to encourage suppliers to adopt sustainable practices by recognizing their progress whenever we can for example in 2013 we presented sugar supplier ra zen with our company is supplier sustainability award for its work leading the sugar industry toward more bonsucro standard certified sugar listening to the experts in february 2013 we convened a small number of globally renowned agriculture and environment experts to discuss the global movement toward sustainable agriculture and our role within it the group shared positive feedback on our sustainable agriculture strategy to date and also challenged us to do more both within our supply chain and beyond it as a leader in our industry our new 2020 commitment isin part a response to that challenge slow but steady growth in bonsucro certified sugar one of our first major steps toward sustainable sourcing was our work with bonsucro a collaboration among peer companies sugarcane producerswwf and other ngos to implement the first global metric standard for more the coca cola company gri report intro me we world reporting index sustainable sugarcane production the bonsucro standard requires evaluation against 20 criteria and 69 indicators on the environmental social and economic impacts of sugarcane production and is divided into five principles obey the law respect human rights and labor standards manage input production and processing efficiencies to enhance sustainability 40 sustainable agriculture projects are supported in 25 countries actively manage biodiversity and ecosystem services continuously improve key areas of the business bonsucro launched its production standard and certification program in 2010 in 2011 a sugar mill in s o paulo brazil became the first to achieve bonsucro certificationand our system was the first buyer of the mill is certified sugar as of september 2013 31 sugarcane mills in brazil and australia representing more than 695000 hectares approximately 17 million acres or 292 percent of the world is surface under sugarcane have been bonsucro certified the amount of sugar certified under the standard has increased

of andhra pradesh to adopt drip irrigation and a method of farming called ultra highdensity plantation practice ultra highdensity plantation practice enables mango orchards to reach their full fruit bearing potential in three to four years rather than the seven to nine years enabled by conventional farmingmeaning farmers earn money from the fruit sooner the practice also makes it possible for farmers to plant as many as 600 trees per acre dramatically increasing yields conventional farming methods allow for about 40 trees per acre during the first phase of the project200 demonstration farms between one and three acres in size will employ the ultra high density plantation technique along with drip irrigation which uses less water per kilogram of mangoes produced later the demonstration farms will be used to train other farmers in all project unnati has the potential to double mango yields and improve the livelihoods of more than 50000 farmers over a five year period great barrier reef lagoon and the freshwater catchments that drain into it the project provides funding and technical expertise to farmers who have developed new practices to promote sustainability

most outstanding progress was in our site in norway see case study below to support this drive for continued improvement we have focused on the following safety initiatives revising our safety standards to make them easier to understand and implement this has increased awareness and compliance changed people is attitudes to safety empowered employees to challenge unsafe practices and made individuals more aware of their role in setting and enforcing standards and safe behaviors providing intensive week long management training for safety teams in all territories designed to raise competency levels these covered safety disciplines such as risk managementgovernance root cause analysis data case study safety improvements in norway and information management and audit along with softer skills such as change management communication and culture developing our europe wide health and safety training curriculum to consolidate and standardize our approach and provide training relevant to three levels of competence awareness manager and practitioner expanding our use and understanding of data recording accidents that result in treatable injuries and potential incidentscommonly referred to as near misses investigating incidents of this type can highlight issues that need attention while providing greater insight into safety trends and helping to avoid more serious incidents all part of a greater emphasis on accident prevention at the same time the plant re launched cce is safety standards while also developing a sharper management focus to eliminate

in 2014 we will be investing in advanced systems which link directly to our production software this has reduced energy consumption by 25 percent and in great britain has reduced the carbon footprint of our ovens by more than 50 percent we are implementing our top five energy saving best practices and have rolled out the coca cola company and the world wildlife fund wwf energy savers program six of our plants antwerp gent and chaudfontaine in belgium marseille and toulouse in france and dongen in the netherlands have been awarded the program is energy savers certificate just under four percent of our manufacturing energy is from renewable and low carbon sources saving more than 3500 tonnes of co2e annually we plan to increase this in the future current and planned projects include we have also piloted the energy management standard iso 50001 at wakefield and east kilbride great britaindunkerque france and chaudfontainebelgium this has helped identify further opportunities which we will share across our sites we have been recognized as one of the leading performers in carbon management by the carbon trust and in 2013 again received the carbon trust standard across all of our operations innovation and technology we continue to invest in process innovation and energy efficient technologies to conserve energy we have developed centrally led projects concentrating on areas of high energy use plus site specific initiatives to address local opportunities recent projects include bottle blower optimization we have rolled out a company wide upgrade installing the latest technology to reduce the energy used to blow our pet bottles we are reducing the standard air pressure needed and installing air recovery systems we have also installed ceramic reflectors to optimize the heat generated within our ovens led energy efficient lighting in 2013 we continued to install energy efficient led and intelligent lighting systems in our sites and plan to fit more in 2014 see case study packaging oven optimization in 2013 we completed our multi site project in belgium and great britain converting electric packer ovens to use gas as a heating source to shrink film for bottle or can packs the program also involved installing roller shutters and oven isleep mode systems alternative and renewable energy district heating district heating provides significant efficiencies by enabling businesses and homes to use a centrally generated source of heat however district heating is only available in some of the areas in which we operate in norway and sweden we have linked our sites to district heating systems fuelled by biomass drawing 25 percent and 36 percent of their energy respectively from this source turning waste heat into energy at our dongen plant in the netherlandswe are working with the ardagh group to test and investigate whether we can capture and use waste heat produced by ardagh is glass production plant at our own manufacturing site located next door combined heat and power chp chp systems produce both electricity and heat from one energy source resulting in lower carbon emissions chps howeverare not suitable for all sites as they require sufficient demand for power and heat we have investigated the feasibility of installing chps at all our sites and identified our largest plant wakefield in great britain as offering the most opportunity we plan to start installation in 2014 solar photovoltaic we have installed solar photovoltaic panels in great britain at edmonton sidcup and wakefield in 2013 we also installed a solar panelled car port linked to electric car charging points at our new head office in uxbridge great britain wind wind turbines require sufficient wind and land to be a possible alternative energy source we have surveyed our sites and invested in detailed tests where opportunities were identified plans and further investigations are being developed for our dongen plant in the netherlands case study heat recovery from air compressors at our sidcup plant in great britainwe have developed and installed a new heat recovery system on our low pressure and high pressure air compressors in a compressor heat is generated this has to be removedwhich requires energy instead we have installed heat exchangers to capture the waste heat which reduces the energy needed and enables the heat to be used for cleaning networks and site heating case study energy efficient led lighting we have invested in led lighting and intelligent management systems in many of our sites these include our production plants in sidcup in great britain and grigny and clamart in france and at our distribution center in northampton great britain the new systems offer significant energy savings as well as higher quality lighting longer lifespans and better control for our northampton site the savings are predicted to halve the site is electricity use saving energy sharing knowledge collaborating with different teams has enabled us to share knowledge and identify energy efficient ideas and innovations across the entire operation it is great to find solutions at a site level that can be rolled out

distribution our commitment our strategy we will deliver a case of product with 20 percent less carbon emissions by 2020 than in 2007 introduction transporting our product is one of the smallest elements of our value chain carbon footprint accounting for seven percent of the total however we drive more than 106 million kilometers a year which makes it important to continue to reduce our kilometers and find new less carbon intensive ways of distributing our products our aim is to grow our business but not our carbon delivering products effectively and efficiently is central to how we operate and achieve this objective we are developing our use of alternative technologies and fuels which now account for 5 of our kilometers driven we are working with our customerssuppliers and logistics partners to reduce our carbon emissions and the number of kilometers driven to deliver our products we aim to drive down our carbon per case delivered million kilometers saved due to backhauling initiatives in 2013 we achieved a reduction in co2e grams per case delivered since 2007 we focus our efforts on three key areas driving fewer kilometers by optimizing our logistics network working in collaboration with our customers and suppliers to remove road kilometers through techniques such as backhauling reducing the carbon emissions of every kilometer driven by improving vehicle efficiency and by encouraging the adoption of alternative technologies network optimization working to optimize our network is fundamental to reducing our carbon emissions our aim is to operate the most efficient and effective distribution network by identifying opportunities to minimize and remove kilometers driven this involves three main activities maximizing local production and deliveries direct from our production sites collaborating with suppliers to understand opportunities for greater efficiencies working with our customers to optimize our routes to market we continue to develop and expand local capacity and storage at our plants reducing the need for long distance freight recent projects include capacity investment in clamart and marseille in france edmonton and wakefield in great britain and oslonorway as well as increasing storage capacity with automated warehousing at corporate responsibility and sustainability report 2013 2014 transportation and distribution our sites in wakefield great britain and dongen in the netherlands in working with our suppliers we consider how materials are delivered to our factories to minimize transportation many of our sites are located alongside our can suppliersenabling the cans to be delivered directly similarly all our pet bottles are blown on site and in recent years we have invested in pet bottle preform manufacture in houseeliminating the need for transportation cutting kilometers from factory to customer involves collaboration both with our customers and across different parts of the business from sales forecasting production planning to route design and vehicle scheduling and utilization this is underpinned by robust management practices shared kpis and joint reporting processes in 2013 we achieved a 171 co2e grams per case delivered which is a reduction of 12 percent since 2007 network optimization projects in particular saved more than 5470000 road kilometers and 5400 tonnes of co2e backhauling we continue to expand our backhauling systems ensuring where possible that trucks are loaded on both the outward and return legs of a delivery in order to reduce empty journeys see case study below in 2013 our backhauling initiatives removed two million road kilometers and 1900 tonnes of co2e alternative technologies and fuels close collaboration with our third party hauliers which now account for the majority of our deliveries has led the way in adopting new carbon reduction technologies and fuels in 2013 these accounted for just under five percent of our distribution kilometers across europe recent developments include eco combis replacing conventional diesel trucks with longer eco combis capable of carrying up to 38 percent more per journey cuts down the number of road trips and reduces our emissions in the netherlands we have expanded our use of eco combi vehicles to a fleet of ten trucks reducing emissions per pallet moved by 22 percent bio and dual fuel trucks we continue to trial and introduce vehicles using alternative fuels in sweden we have switched from fossil fuels to biodiesel with 75 percent of our trucks running on biofuel increasing our use further is currently limited by our early adoption of vehicles meeting the vehicle air quality standard euro 6 in the netherlands we introduced the first eco combi truck in the worldwide coca cola system to be powered by dual fuel we run a further ten standard trucks fueled by using landfill derived biogas a form of energy produced from household waste we have also worked closely with hauliers in some of our other territories to trial dual fuel vehicles in sweden we operate 33 dual fuel delivery trucks powered by a mix of 75 percent rapeseed oil biogas and 25 percent regular diesel until alternative fuels and truck technologies become more viablewe see dual fuel vehicles as a key element of our sustainable distribution strategy electric vehicles electric vehicles can offer benefits for regular shorter journeys but are limited by the weight they can carry we have trialed electric vehicles for glaceau vitaminwater deliveries in paris france completing more than 1100 orders in 2013 similarly we are trialing the use of electric vans for inner city routes in oslo norway and for our sales teams in belgium we also use electric vehicles in our company car fleet case study we have used backhauling for many years to reduce our road kilometers and we continue to expand and develop new routes as new opportunities are identified led by our customer logistics and routing teams our backhauling program is complex it requires close collaboration with customers or suppliers that typically have a site near one of our plants project teams work together to combine deliveries with collections to avoid vehicles returning empty this way we save overall kilometers and reduce emissions while making our logistics more efficient and creating value for our partners we have backhaul arrangements with 28 major customers including tescoasda bookers casino carrefoursysteme u and similar arrangements with many of our suppliers such as those that supply our cans in sweden and our pallets in dunkerque france rail where long distance journeys are necessary we use multi modal transport where trailers are transported by rail with only short truck journeys at each end of the route in 2013 we celebrated our 4000th multi modal rail delivery in france smaller trucks and company cars we are reducing emissions from our car and van fleet through a variety of measuresfrom introducing caps on co2 g km to trialing electric and dual fuel cars vehicle technology is improving with more low carbon vehicles becoming available in 2013 we reviewed the vehicles we offer our employees choosing models with the highest energy efficiency and safety standards and increasing the range of hybrid cars since 2010 we have reduced our car fleet is average co2g km by 18 percent in belgiumwhere we use smaller trucks we limit their speed to 80km per hour which also saves fuel working with the industry to benchmark our progress and demonstrate our commitment to low carbon vehicles and fuels we work with industry groups and have joined the netherlands and belgium lean green program and the centre for sustainable freight transport in great britain we are also working with ademe in france to help develop a carbon reduction charter and are part of the haga emissions reduction initiative in sweden optimizing and driving our emissions collaboration across our network has enabled

led lighting to reduce the carbon footprint of our cold drinks equipment 2013 average co2e per unit of equipment our cooling equipment strategy has four priorities collaborating with suppliers to purchase new more efficient equipment installing energy efficient technology to existing equipment during refurbishment and at our customers premises buying coolers that do not contain hydrofluorocarbon hfc greenhouse gas refrigerants working with suppliers to develop technology and innovation new equipment we have high standards for new equipment that we buy and install in our customers premises we only purchase equipment that is at least 40 percent more energy efficient than the equivalent equipment we purchased in 2000 since 2010 we have not purchased large open fronted units that use high levels of energy all new coolers with a capacity of over 250 liters also come with an energy management device we also specify low energy led lighting or no lighting at all if customers request it where possible our new purchases come with electronically commutated ec fans and motors in addition we retrofit ec components at our customers premises corporate responsibility

consumption by up to 35 percent since 2010 we have fitted 182000 ems devices as a result 65 percent of the relevant coolers and 47 percent of our vending machines now use this technology where space does not allow we install the more compact ems 25 plus devicewhich also produces up to 35 percent energy saving in 2013 we extended our program further by rolling out an energy management solution specifically designed for our fountain business see case study programing our vending machines existing equipment cooling equipment is refurbished several times to extend its working life we also continue to make existing coolers and vendors more energy efficient units are refurbished at six service centers across our territories while tens of thousands more are retrofitted with energy efficient technology on our customers premises every year in 2013 we fitted energy reduction components to just under 44000 units these include fitting doors fitting doors to our large open fronted coolers reduces their energy use by up to 50 percent we have fitted doors to 62 percent of our open fronted cooler fleet and aim to reach 75 percent by the end of 2016 of the remainder 15 percent are in outlets where access prevents doors being replaced and 10 percent are models we will phase out we are also fitting doors to our smalleropen fronted impulse coolers we have converted 21 percent of the fleet so far with more than 2200 units upgraded in 2013and are planning to continue this program in 2014 more efficient lighting cce has led the way in replacing fluorescent lights in coolers and vending machines with more efficient led lighting which can cut energy consumption by up to 80 percent we are now installing tube leds which are quick to fit and means less disruption for our customers we have so far fitted long life led lights to more than 133600 items of equipment 28 percent of applicable units and plan to fit another 21800 in 2014 some of our vending machines can be programed to save up to 25 percent of energy used we programed 2000 machines in 2013 and plan to complete this initiative in the coming years becoming hfc free hfc refrigerants are potent greenhouse gases that can contribute to global warming if they leak or are released when equipment is disposed of in an uncontrolled manner we have made great progress in our transition to hfc free refrigerants in 201050 percent of our cooler purchases were hfc free by the end of 2013 this had risen to 998 percent cce is committed to purchasing only hfc free coolers where a commercial hfc free solution is not currently availablewe collaborate with our suppliers to develop new hfc free solutions we are now looking to accelerate the transition to hfc free across the rest of our cold drinks equipment portfolio including vendors and fountain equipment to prevent leakage of hfcs from existing coolers our cooling equipment is maintained to high standards by our technical centers and field engineers we also have systems in place for safe disposal when equipment comes to the end of its useful life technology evolution and innovation we believe that further developments in innovation and technology have a significant part to play in meeting the sustainability challenges of the future we look to collaborate with businesses working at the forefront of this technology to find innovative solutions case study energy management timer for drinks fountains in 2013 we launched an energy saving solution specifically designed for units used to cool fountain drinks in venues such as pubs and cinemas the device powers down equipment when the outlet is closed operating only intermittently to maintain drink quality and then powering up just before the outlet opens again the device prevents units running 24 hours a day and cuts energy consumption by up to 30 percent we installed 3300 of these devices in 2013 and plan to install up to 24000 over the next three years since january 2013 of the coolers we have purchased have been hfc free staying cool while reducing energy we work in the field engineering team in the netherlands in 2013 we replaced 5200 fluorescent lighting tubes with energy efficient led tubes which will last longer and use less energy we also deactivated the illuminated header in 1000 coolers replacing these with reflective non illuminated graphics we are proud to be

commitment our strategy we will set the standard for sustainable packaging achieve zero waste in our operations and recycle more packaging than we use introduction packaging is essential to safeguard the quality of our drinks and ensure their safe delivery to our customers and consumers it is also an important resource we are committed to supporting a circular economy by ensuring that maximum value can be gained from the use of resources packaging can be carbon intensive in its manufacture and despite the fact that nearly all of our packaging is recyclable it is often not recycled we estimate that packaging accounts for about half of the carbon emissions in our value chain reducing our carbon footprint and optimizing resource use means looking at every aspect of our packaging from design material used weight and recyclability reduction in our packaging use ratio since 2012 average recycled pet used in our pet bottles of recycled aluminum steel and glass used in our packaging more than tonnes of recycled material used in our packaging we continue to evolve and innovate our packaging to contribute to our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by a third by 2020 our strategy focuses on three core pillars using less material for each product using more recycled and renewable materials making sure that our own packs are recyclable using less material we have a long standing program of lightweighting our packaging and continue to challenge ourselves to do more without affecting quality our redesign process uses environmental assessment methodologies to identify opportunities to use less material and reduce carbon emissions we monitor improvements by tracking the average total weight of packaging per liter of product our packaging use ratio in 2013 we used 1198g liter of product just over three percent less than in 2012 1239g liter in 2013 lightweighting initiatives and the use of recycled and renewable materials reduced the carbon impact of our business by 21800 tonnes of co2e these included reducing the weight of our 500ml pet bottles from 247g to 217g in all territoriessaving 1500 tonnes of co2e we plan a further reduction to 199g starting in benelux and great britain saving another 1200 tonnes of co2e in 2014 corporate responsibility and sustainability report 2013 2014 sustainable packaging reducing the weight of our large pet bottles by introducing lighter shorter closures for sparkling brands in great britain and our water brand in belgiumsaving 800 tonnes of co2e reducing the weight of our aluminum cans across our territories our lightest 330ml cans are now below 10g and we are working to further lightweight all our cans continuing to lightweight our can ends with successful rollout in great britain and france saving 1800 tonnes of co2e further rollout is also planned for sweden in 2014 reducing the weight of our secondary and tertiary packaging by reducing plastic film weight and removing cardboard trays as a result just over 4000 tonnes of co2e have been removed from our packaging footprint in 2014 we plan to further reduce our large 15l and 175l pet packs in great britain from 417g to 403g and to develop the next generation of lightweight closures we will also continue to look for further packaging innovation and lightweighting opportunities using recycled and renewable materials crucial step in developing sustainable packaging and reducing our carbon footprint is to use more material from recycled and renewable sources recycled materials we believe recycled material can play an important role within a circular economy and are committed to increasing the amount of recycled material in all packaging types case study lightest 330ml glass bottle since 2005 cce and ardagh glass uk have been working to reduce the weight of our coca cola sprite and fanta 330ml glass bottle through various initiatives including investment in design technology and changes in the glass forming process the bottle now weighs 190g a 21 percent reduction since 2005 recent reductions have saved a further 2100 tonnes of co2e our 2013 packaging footprint in 2013 we used a total of 368261 tonnes of material materials used aluminum steel pet tonnes total of our pet bottles were plantbottle glass secondary and tertiary packaging aluminum and steel recycling metals saves a significant amount of energy for example it takes 95 percent less energy to produce recycled aluminum than virgin aluminum we have made it a priority to increase the recycled content of our cans we are working with ngos government industry bodies and local authorities to encourage consumers to recycle more and support campaigns such as metal matters happiness recycled at local festivals and in store and online customer campaigns with retailers see factsheet 20 we are also working with aluminum and steel producers and can manufacturers to make our cans more environmentally friendly pet approximately 60 percent less energy is used in producing recycled pet rpet than the virgin material however recycling levels are lower for pet than for metals to address this we have invested in plastics reprocessing in great britain our joint venture continuum is the largestmost sophisticated plant of its kind in the world in france our joint venture infineohas increased the rpet plant capacity by 70 percent glass recycled glass is used in our bottles and we are working with our suppliers and waste management companies to increase the recycled content renewable material we have made progress in increasing rpet in our bottles however to reduce the use of virgin pet even further we have also looked to renewable sources in many of our products and territories we now use plantbottle a material containing up to 225 percent plant based material and 25 percent rpet in addition now that our plant in norway uses recyclable and non returnable pet bottles we have increased our use of plantbottle even further in 2013 33 percent of all the pet bottles we produced were plantbottle both rpet and plantbottle make a significant contribution to our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain we believe the best environmental solution is to use a combination of the two sustainably sourced cardboard the majority of the cardboard packaging we use comes from recycled sources that said a small proportion of virgin fiber is still needed for strength the source of this virgin material is important to us we are working with our suppliers to gain sustainable forest management accreditation under the program of endorsement of forest certification pefc by the end of 201390 percent of our cardboard had achieved accreditation to ensure a supply of good quality recycled material and avoid our packaging going to landfill it is important to design for recyclability from the start by the end of 2013 100 percent of our bottles and cans were recyclable increasing rpet in our bottles through collaboration with our suppliers and technical innovation we have been able to achieve an average of 32 rpet across all pet packs in 2013 we use data and in

operation and minimize water impacts throughout our value chain introduction water is one of nature is most precious resources it is critical to our communities our ecosystems and the sustainability of our business it is an essential ingredient in our beverages and central both to our manufacturing processes and to many of the agricultural ingredients we use we are committed to being responsible stewards of water and using as little water as possible for each liter of beverage we produce this factsheet focuses on our water stewardship programs within our own operations for information on water protection and replenishment and sustainable agriculture see factsheets 22 and 23 respectively water use ratio progress 2007 2013 and target 1 liters water used to make one liter of product 164

of 86m cubic meters of water our water stewardship program focuses on four strategic priorities protecting our water sources for our operations and communities reducing the amount of water we use by becoming more water efficient recycling the water we use by ensuring it is treated and returned to the environment at standards supporting aquatic life replenishing the water that goes into our beverages in areas of water stress or where water quality may be an issue this factsheet focuses on priorities two and three for priorities one and four see factsheet 22 using less water ensuring a water efficient operation is key to our water stewardship strategy in 2013 our total water consumption was 86 million cubic meters m3 down 18 percent from 2012 and our wastewater volume was 26 million m3 down 9 percent both were achieved despite increased production we monitor our water efficiency by calculating the water needed to produce a liter of product known as our water use ratio in 2013 we used 135 liters liter which was down 35 percent from 2012 140 l l and 18 down from 2007 164 l l in 2014 we aim to further reduce our water use ratio to 134 liters liter and are committed to achieving 120 liters liter by 2020 water stewardship in 2013 we invested in water reduction technologies of our wastewater was treated to standards1 supporting aquatic life while we can t reduce the water in our products we can use less in our cleaning and manufacturing processes we have invested in water meters water mappingand monitoring and targeting systems and have developed process optimization techniques we operate company wide water monitoring targets are set annually and reduction options are identified and modeled we have also implemented a water savers program developed by the coca cola

river nar catchment in norfolk where a high proportion of the sugar beet used in our drinks in great britain is grown the project focuses on three core elements the first is to restore the nar to its natural meandering state to help the river and the surrounding meadows work more harmoniously in times of flood and attract more wildlife secondly we are reducing agricultural pollution and build up of river sediment by implementing silt traps and working with local farmers to adopt more sustainable farming methods finally a river catchment management plan has been developed this explains the health of the river and sets out a roadmap of actions needed to restore it the project outcomes are encouraging and are being used to demonstrate what good river management can look like we believe

working in partnership with the coca cola company and wwf uk on a three year water protection and replenishment project for two english rivers the nar in norfolk and the cray near our sidcup plant in kent in each case we are developing local catchment plans and implementing on the ground projects to restore water and improve water quality see case study overleaf calculations indicate that since 2012 these projects have resulted in more than 157800m3 of water being replenished and habitats have been improved in an area of approximately four kilometers lessons learned from these exemplar projects will be shared to encourage others to introduce measures to reduce water abstraction and demand and to raise discussion and debate to help develop national water policy replenishment in our supply chain our studies show that around 80 percent of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural supply chain in particular the production and processing of sugar for cce a significant proportion of the sugar we use is from sugar beet we must consider the amount and the importance of the water we use a large water footprint might be sustainable in a water rich area while a smaller one in a water scarce region can have a far greater environmental impact in view of these geographical differenceswe have been working with our european sugar beet processors to

develop our approach to sustainable agriculture this includes an ambitious new goal for the global coca cola system to isustainably source key agricultural ingredients by 2020 for information on our broader sustainability work with our suppliers see factsheet 7 our strategy at cce our focus is on ensuring that the sugar cane and sugar beet we use in north west europe is sourced sustainably working with the coca cola companywe have established a set of sustainable agriculture guiding principles sagps and are developing partnerships with our sugar suppliers to ensure that our sugar is sustainably sourced in 2013 we established an internal sustainable agriculture steering group to oversee this work sustainable agriculture is now a key pillar in our sustainability journey and we will continue to develop our plans in this area sustainable agriculture guiding principles in 2013 together with the coca cola company we launched our sagpsspecifically for suppliers of agricultural ingredients the principles are designed to work in conjunction with our supplier guiding principles see factsheet 7 the principles set out what we mean by isustainable sourcing and include expectations and criteria that our suppliers will be expected to meet in terms of human and workplace rights the environment and sustainable farm management practices see sagps overleaf at cce we have shared our sagps with our suppliers of sugar beet and sugar cane and will work with them over time to ensure they are able to meet our criteria sustainable agriculture corporate responsibility and sustainability report 2013 2014 sustainable cane focus on sugar our work to understand the water footprint of our value chain highlighted that sugar taking account of farming processing and production can account for up to 80 percent of our value chain water footprint as a result our focus at cce is on ensuring that the sugar cane and sugar beet we use in north west europe is sourced sustainably understanding the different sustainability issues and the supply chains of these two very different crops is central to our sustainable agriculture strategy sustainable beet at cce a significant proportion of the sugar we use is from sugar beet a root crop grown widely in north west europe in 2013 we began working with the coca cola company and wwf to define the best practices for sustainable sugar beet farming in europe and to identify a set of standards that support our sagps in collaboration with europe is sugar beet processors we worked with the sustainable agricultural initiative sai platform to develop a farm level self assessment tool the farmer sustainability assessment fsa following a pilot with a number of sugar beet farmers in europe the fsa was formally adopted and we are now working with our sugar beet suppliers to roll it out sugar cane is a grass crop produced in sub tropical areas under the existing eu sugar regime around 70 percent of europe is sugar cane imports are sourced from developing countries which have preferential trading relationships with the eu the coca cola company has played an important role in the establishment of bonsucro a global standard for sustainable sugar cane production to accelerate our move towards sustainably sourced sugar cane in europe we are working with the coca cola company to consider how sustainable agricultural practices can also be implemented in smallholder sugarcane farms in 2013 we took our first step on this journey by working with the rainforest alliance to develop our understanding of the sustainability risks and current best practice in the sugar cane supply chain in europe we will continue this work in 2014 or more information see www saiplatform org farmerselfassessment farmer self

to coca cola enterprises none of which constitute a conflict of interest with this assurance work our key observations and recommendations we have provided a confidential management letter containing our observations and recommendations made during the course of our work to coca cola enterprises senior management without affecting our assurance opinion our overall key observations and recommendations are summarised below we restate our recommendation to coca cola enterprises to review the current suite of targets and kpis to ensure they are aligned with the core business strategy we understand that this review is already underway and once completeshould establish targets and kpis that are both challenging enough to the business and that address the expectations of customers and other key stakeholders we see an opportunity for coca cola enterprises to explore how to report in future on the direct and indirect socio economic impacts of its operations the breadth of these impacts will be extensive ranging from economic development amongst upstream suppliers knock on effects in the vicinity of manufacturing operations economic activity in the post consumer value chainand the contributions made at a national level through taxation corporate responsibility and sustainability report 2013 2014 assurance statement our key observations and recommendations relating to the factsheets in scope of this assurance engagement include diversity coca cola enterprises demonstrates a proactive approach to employee diversity and inclusion for example through the roll out of diversity in action and diversity is everybody is business programs current activities and kpis reported in the factsheets focus primarily on gender diversity we recommend coca cola enterprises should consider ways of expanding its reporting of performance for other diversity metrics such as disabilityethnicity and sexual orientation our conclusions on the basis of the work undertakennothing came to our attention to suggest that there are any material misstatements within the corporate responsibility and sustainability performance data for the year ended 31 december 2013 as published in

made significant progress in these areas over the last year particularly in assessing what is required to replenish water usage within the context of local water catchment areas we recommend that coca cola enterprises should continue to explore the social dimensions of water protection and replenishment to provide a more detailed account of the benefits and trade offs involved jon woodhead head of department uk sustainability we observed that water stewardship and replenishment kpis such as the water use ratio and water replenishment are calculated by manually entering a significant number of data points from the master database such manual manipulation of data risks introducing human error in the data entry and transposition of figures we recommend that coca cola enterprises considers establishing an automated system to capture data from the master database into their kpi calculation spreadsheets ", "2014 2015 sustainability report 2014 2015 sustainability report intro me we world

of sustainable increases in recovery rates including packaging and climate protection infrastructure improvements we set ambitious goals with an end education programs and strategic date of 2015 we have met some different beverage offerings we produce requires some form of package packaging is vital to protecting our products during goal work with our partners to recover and recycle the equivalent of 75 percent of the bottles and cans we introduce delivery and use and nearly all of into developed markets by 2020 our packaging material has value progress on track we estimate a as recycled material our efforts to create more sustainable packaging are expected to contribute to our overall goal of reducing the co2 emissions associated with the drink in your hand by 2020 sustainability in packaging requires a wide range of actions including engaging consumers advocating for policy changes building supply chain partnerships developing renewable 61 percent recovery rate in developed markets currently goal we aim to recover and recycle 50 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans we introduce globally each year by 2015 progress on track we estimate that united states the partnership offers of these goals and are on track to recycled and renewable pet achieve others but are likely to miss goal source 25 percent of our pet does not dampen our determination some while this is disappointing it plastic from recycled or renewable to continue leading the industry in material by 2015 these areas progress off track 124 percent of our systemwide analysis of our our packaging materials within the carbon footprint demonstrates global system are currently made with that packaging is a significant recycled or renewable material 48 percent of equivalent bottles and cans we send to market are recovered realigning our goals more than half of our global volume today is delivered through pet plastic contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions with that in mind we have decided to track and measure our work on recycled and renewable while the two recovery goals listed beverage bottles which consumers above may seem similar the distinctions prefer for lightweight shatter resistant are important because the significant resealable cost effective and recyclable differences in infrastructure between packaging by sourcing more of our developed and developing countries global system pet from renewable and drink in your hand by 25 percent and reuse packaging mean the pace of packaging recovery recycled sources we can continue to by 2020 this approach accounts for the importance of climate our long term vision is to leverage will vary between developed markets offer these benefits while helping to and the globe as a whole reduce our environmental footprint change to the global community we have made progress toward these recycled pet technologies and more ultimatelyit requires building a system in which many people institutions and technologies work together to reduce redesign recover recycle our significant scale and resources to contribute meaningfully to the circular economy in which materials are used and reused to constantly rebuild natural and social capital in this system all resources material energy and human are seen as valuable as we strive to achieve our refreshed packaging goals see sidebar realigning our goals we are learning more about how this circular economy can and should work goals through continued support of recovery and recycling programs our system works with community organizations and supports initiatives pet and lightweighting packaging as part of our overarching goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the and our business while giving our business and our bottling partners coca

developed by the coca cola company plantbottle packaging replaces the traditional fossil based ingredients used to make a key ingredient in pet plastic with renewable materials made from plants in 2014 alone we distributed more than 9 billion we set the goal of sourcing 25 percent of pet plantbottle packages since the material is launch in we do not report collections plastic from recycled or renewable material 2009 through december 2014 more than 30 billion through programs managed in 2009 since then we have encountered plantbottle packages have reached the market in directly manages or funds independently by municipalities challenges including or through informal systems in low supply high demand while we3are developing markets we have learned that many stakeholders mistakenly believe that the recovery percentage we report refers to the total number of bottles and cans diverted from landfill in reality the recycling and diversion rate is much higher especially in many developing markets many developing countries do not track or report recovery and recycling rates we are working with many maximizing sourcing efforts for rpet in various regions as described above food grade rpet represents only 10 percent of total available recycled materials globally in some marketslow recycling rates for usable pet in addition to package lightweighting mean fewer materials are available for conversion to rpet meanwhilecompetition for rpet has increased from sectors including the fiber industry and other consumer number of recycled or recovered bottles and cans refillable glass to six year lows in 2014 which reduced the cost cost of incorporating more rpet in our packages more accurate reporting of the total and steel cans ingredient in pet the price of

countries by 13 compared to 2004 climate protection approach progress around the world partnerships what is next climate change is an issue with profound impact on the global community that requires great attention from and collaboration among government business and civil society the world is climate is highly relevant to our business and supply chain we are committed to responsibly managing our climate impacts by using the best mix of energy sources we can while improving the energy efficiency of our manufacturing and distribution processes we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our entire value chain by making comprehensive changes in our manufacturing processes packaging formats delivery fleetrefrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing find current news and additional information about our approach to climate protection on coca cola journey intro 2014 2015 sustainability report our approach the gradual increase in our atmosphere is average temperature is causing concern that erratic weather patterns and severe natural disasters will become more frequent around the world climate scientists continue to provide evidence that this increase is due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity this poses major challenges for the natural environment and for the communities in which we operate it could also affect our business and supply chain in the long run our company relies on natural resources and raw materials for our productsespecially water and agricultural commodities such as sugarcane cornsugar beets citrus coffee and tea climate change could exacerbate water scarcity or reduce water quality in certain regions water the main ingredient in most of our products is vital to our manufacturing processes and to the cultivation of our agricultural ingredients so the impact of climate change on water availability is of special concern to us as we discuss in our position statement on climate protection the coca cola system is committed to making changes in our operations geared toward reducing our climate impact we are striving to reduce emissions from our manufacturing processes and also driving collaboration throughout our supply chain to reduce emissions associated with the growing of our ingredients the production of our packaging and the distribution and refrigeration of our products evolution of our goals some years back we set aggressive 2015 goals in the areas of climate and packaging as we detail in this section we have already met some of these goals are on track to achieve others and will fall short of achieving our targets in a few areas recognizing the role we play as an industry leaderwe have regularly opted for setting demanding targets to drive fundamental change rather than just incremental improvement across our bottling system even while understanding that their attainment was not guaranteed and as we have advanced in these efforts with our bottling partnerswe have often helped to positively influence the progress in our industry as well we provide reflections on the journey toward our 2015 goals in our progress the company and our bottling partners remain committed to our work on programs related to climate protection and sustainable packaging we will continue to make progress on these important programs moving forward the work our system has been doing toward our 2015 goals as described in this section around refrigeration and manufacturing emissions and in our sustainable packaging section around renewable and recycled contentand material resource efficiency will continue to be tracked and reported transparently within our overarching goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by 25 percent by 2020 this shift in how we capture and share our progress reflects the critical and multifaceted challenge that climate change poses to the globe and to our business our evolved approach integrates several aspects of our sustainability framework including those around packaging and sustainable agriculture and it maximizes the flexibility of our business and our bottling partners to pursue whichever efforts are most effective toward meeting this overarching goal me we world reporting index as we have traveled along our journey to embed our sustainability framework into our business we have learned about the importance of giving our system flexibility in how they support initiatives our carbon footprint can be reduced through efforts involving packaging agricultural ingredientsmanufacturing distribution and refrigeration which strategies are best depends strongly on local conditions with this in mind we have equipped our business unit leaders with tools to determine the best interventions and to measure their progress see sustainable packaging and we plan to hold these business unit leaders accountable for their progress our progress goal reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by 25 percent by 2020 progress draft reduction targets have been set through 2020 by business units we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our entire value chain by making comprehensive changes in our manufacturing processes packaging formats delivery fleet refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing to empower global managers to reach this goal we have developed a carbon scenario planner to help standardize a forecast methodology for carbon in the system supply chain and to support regional target setting in 2014 all our business unit leaders utilized the planner to evaluate a portfolio of carbon reduction interventions and develop initial annual reduction targets in 2014 we also entered an assurance readiness process with a third party assurance provider to assess the program design and reporting processes related to the drink in your hand goal intro 2014 2015 sustainability report we have since implemented a number of recommendations arising from this assessment as part of our work to reduce our carbon footprint we aim to reduce the greenhouse emissions of our distribution trucking fleet the source of about 4 percent of our value chain emissions our global system is fleet which includes trucks operated by our company and our bottling partners emitted an estimated 37 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2014 though they currently compose a small portion of our fleet we continue to add delivery trucks that are powered with a mix of alternative fuelsincluding electricitynatural gas dieselelectric and biodiesel hfc free coolers goal as of 2015 all new cold drink equipment will be hfc free across our global system progress off track in 2014we placed approximately 297500 units of hfc free equipment approximately 30 percent of new equipment purchases bringing our global total to more than 14 million units refrigeration is the largest source of our system is carbon emissions footprint because of the high global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbons hfcs we are phasing out the use of hfc refrigerants in our cold drink equipment across our global value chain about 40 percent of our 14 million hfc free coolers are co2 based co2 has 1430 times less global warming potential than typical hfc refrigerant gas co2 refrigerated equipment has been in the marketplace for almost a decade and has been proven reliablewith a lower lifetime cost all told the coca cola system has invested more than 100 million over the past decade to make our coolers more environmentally responsible we have certified 230 cooler models as meeting our performance standards more than three quarters of these certified models are more energyefficient than legacy models and 60 percent have a higher cooling capacity nearly 40 percent are certified to perform in hot or humid conditions in some markets more than 75 percent of our cooling system purchases are hfc free but higher costs and difficulty in sourcing hfcfree equipment in certain countries have hindered our progress we have also faced challenges developing hfc free coolers in certain categoriessuch as countertop units we will continue to track our progress against this goal as we align me we these initiatives against our 2020 commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand manufacturing emissions goal grow our business but not our carbon emissions from

our approach approach our sustainable agriculture guiding in 2014 we made steady progress in the principles sagp help define what more sustainable sourcing of several commodities it is important for the coca cola company to sustainable sourcing means to us and lay out we are working toward engaging suppliers of address agricultural challenges and opportunities our expectations for suppliers in the following all our key ingredients through our new supplier systemwide and across our entire value chain fifty areas human and workplace rights environmental engagement program it provides a framework percent of the coca cola system is procurement stewardship and responsible farm management consisting of seven stages of improvement expenditures goes toward agricultural ingredients linking us closely with agricultural communities worldwide there are many aspects to consider including rising demand of key commodities women is empowerment economic developmentwater management human and labor rightsand energy and climate impacts the need to understand the interconnected relationships among all of these topic areas has led to the conclusion that the most effective approach to address sustainable agriculture is through the development of an integrated waterenergy food strategy four areas that we will focus on as part of this approach are building on these principles we have developed a new supplier engagement program which gives guidance to our suppliers on various pathways to achieve sagp compliance this comprehensive program applies to all geographies and covers the key commodities and ingredients used to produce our products toward reaching compliance with our sustainable agriculture guiding principles sagps suppliers are given information and guidance about assessments audits measurement of progressand validation of performance so that they can qualify for sustainability certification through our program we aim to establish and maintain reliablelong term relationships with suppliers support we believe that sustainable agriculture is in the many environmental and social aspects of our collective best interest ensuring improved sustainability in communities where our ingredients environmental health economic profitability and are grown and processed and accelerate progress inclusion for example the global purchasing power toward our 2020 goal

forest of the sierra de las minas mountains of eastern guatemala serves as the primary source of water for thousands of people who live and work in communities that are located in the pasabien and teculutan watersheds the rivers that flow down the mountainside once provided a plentiful supply of water for human consumption agriculture and business however deforestation intensive agriculture and human encroachment into the area combined with a changing climate degraded the natural ecosystem of these watersheds this led to droughts forest fires polluted water sources and crop failure with dire consequences for both nature and people loss of biodiversity respiratory problems from smoke and increased competition for scarce resources in response more than a decade ago wwf and the fundaci n defensores de la naturaleza launched an integrated watershed management project that simultaneously addressed the interconnected issues of climate water and agriculture the coca cola company was among the first to sign on as a partner and joined the project in 2007 now one of many wwf projects we are proud to support around the world in the teculutan and pasabien watersheds the coca cola company provided funding and partnered with wwf for technical expertise while our local bottling partner abasa signed a conservation agreement to help protect 500 hectares of forests through fire prevention activities and controlled burning wwf also engaged local communities farmers and businesses on the importance of forest preservation and supported farmers to use sustainable agriculture practices such as improved crop irrigation to reduce water use and agricultural run off in addition the project provided local people with energy efficient cook stoves to help reduce the demand for charcoal required for cooking and local businesses including our bottling partner were encouraged to reduce their water use and improve their treatment of wastewater these activities have helped to reduce deforestation

with clear expectations on making measurable progress in meeting our psa on the farms where raw materials for our products are grown set out through sourcing contracts and other supplier communications through our principles for sustainable agriculture psa supplier guide we provide guidance to suppliers on implementation of the psa in partnership with our supply partners we also support sustainable agriculture initiatives such as training and extension services to farmers to implement more sustainable practices that enhance quality productivity and farmer incomes tools for self assessment to track progress and continuous improvement of best practices in addition suppliers of global priority ingredients are required to provide annual letters of attestation detailing the percentage of volume of ingredients sold to us that comply with our psa these letters must specify countries of origin and the relevant verifications and standards that have been met circular water use for sugar cane in china as much as 60 of the sugar produced in china comes from guangxi zhuang autonomous region guangxi in an area that suffers from both droughts and floods to help address this challenge we have been working with the coca cola foundation the united nations development program undp and the china international center for economic and technical exchanges cicete over the last decade to help increase the production of sugar cane while reducing water use this has been done by promoting drip irrigation systems and the use of treated wastewater from nearby sugar mills for irrigation the project is a great example of scaling up it started with direct support by project partners on 200 hectares in 2011 2013 through the demonstration of the benefits of taking this new sustainable agriculture approach the chinese local government supported the project s replication and expansion to an additional 6 500 hectares in 2013 before leading to a full scale rollout across the entire sugar cane sector in guangxi as of january 2021 a total of 350 000 hectares have benefited from agricultural practices piloted by the program both in guangxi and neighboring provinces case study the water agriculture connection our comprehensive enterprise water footprint assessment showed that 73 of our company s total water footprint and 92 of our freshwater footprint is from growing the ingredients needed for our beverages we have therefore integrated ingredient sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our water and sustainable agriculture strategies as we explore ways to address water use in our agriculture supply chain we are focusing on two main tracks similar to the approach we have taken for operational water use in our production facilities actions we take to promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water stressed regions actions we take to improve overall watershed health in priority sourcing regions where our global priority ingredients are grown in 2021 we began developing a water agriculture guidebook to outline a prioritization framework of global priority agricultural ingredients with the highest

weighted average of national collection rates collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to tccs s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans

please note however that all questions presented to employee relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation while we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool we no longer capture that data this helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual human rights cases this change accounts for the 2019

million gallons of water annually water sources for new sites each of our businesses applies the elements of an environmental site assessment similar to the epa astm standard for phase one environmental site assessment with specific regard to water sources in the united states we utilize a mixture of municipal supplies which may be from surface or groundwater sourcesand private wells the selection and management of municipal sources fall under the jurisdiction of the united states environmental protection agency usepa and any applicable corresponding state authority these sources must comply with the epa national primary drinking water regulations and any other applicable regulations and practices related to water resource selection and development for example site selectionwell construction drought management plans and many other elements sites are selected to assure ample water supply and minimal impact to the local watershed pepsico is involved as a full supporter and advisory board member in the development of a water resource assessment tool which has been introduced by the world business council for sustainable development pepsico performance with purpose wbcsd in conjunction with a world recognized environmental consulting firm this tool provides an assessment of relative water availability abundance stress scarcity for any physical location coordinates entered in addition to a wealth of other water related information this is the first comprehensive tool of its kind that was entered into the public domain completely free of charge for use by any and all business sectors governments ngos and other stakeholders it was launched august 2007 to great acclaim during world water week in stockholm water quality our facilities in the united states are primarily supplied by municipal water sources as such these sources comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide consumer confidence reports ccr which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with epa quality requirements our facilities in the united states are in essence consumers of this municipal drinking water just as are residential customers of the same supplies as such the quality data for the water that is purchased is available from the municipal water purveyors whether the purchaser is pepsico one of our franchise partners or a home consumer similarly outside the united statesmany of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources and the same approach would apply the governing national and local regulations for water resources and water quality would and do apply in areas of the world where we develop our own water sources for example extraction from commercial wells we do so in the china mother water cellars project increases water availability in remote areas of china full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources in these cases we work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business and thereby to help support the local community and economy is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sourcesevery source is tested by an approvedexternal laboratory which is capable of reporting drinking water testing results the test protocol is based on the most current revision of the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality and also includes testing required by local authorities as well every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified which includes using government accredited recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of roughly 100 parameterscovering many classes of raw water chemical physical constituents in addition the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be microbial and chemically safe we also believe that protection of water at the source is important accordingly a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel which covers areas such as water source selection well construction and source protection at every plant the incoming water is then further purified using a variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products whether these products are bottled water carbonated beverages or non carbonated drinks in addition to source qualification our plants monitor the raw in processand treated water for a core list of parameters and at frequencies ranging from hourly to daily to weekly depending on the specific parameter and application we have also established internal laboratories in the united states and europe which monitor raw treated and bottled water quality worldwide community engagement pepsico has been involved in positive community

through a comprehensive program to conserve and 26 2007 2008 pepsico corporate sustainability report optimize water usage both in our own manufacturing processes and in the communities we serve we have carried out a variety of innovative reuse and recycling initiatives in the last five years in india we have reduced our water use in manufacturing by more than 55 percent in just the last three years we have saved more than 25 billion liters of water through water conservation efforts in manufacturing plants we have also prevented depletion of ground water aquifers by constructing rainwater harvesting systems in most of our plants we have supplemented this by introducing community water projects in farms and comprehensive watershed management programs in diverse and challenging geographic locations similar projects are underway in china thailand and mexico reducing water use in agriculture while using water responsibly throughout our business is a top priority we also believe in our ability to address the broader problem of water scarcity in india for example where reducing water use in agriculture in india accounts for over 80 percent of total fresh water consumption pepsico is working with farmers to reduce water intensity in paddy cultivation by around 30 percent through direct seeding of paddy that avoids the traditional flood irrigation method currently practiced by paddy growers across the country paddy is india is largest grain crop and consumes the bulk of fresh water used in indian agriculture in 2007 pepsico piloted this program on 100 acres and this was scaled up to cover 1000 acres in 2008 the significant impact of this change can be gauged from the fact that if only 6000 acres of paddy cultivation were shifted to direct seedingit would offset the entire water used in pepsico india is beverage plants partnering for change pepsico chairman and ceo indra nooyi publicly demonstrated pepsico is commitment to helping address the

purveyors comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide consumer confidence reports ccr which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with epa quality requirements our facilities in the united states are in essence consumers of this municipal drinking water just as are residential customers of the same supplies as such the quality data for the water that is purchased is available from the municipal water purveyors whether the purchaser is pepsico one of our franchise partners or a home consumer similarly outside the united states many of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources and the same approach would apply the governing national and local regulations for water resources and water quality would and do apply in areas of the world where we develop our own water sources for example extraction from commercial wells we do so in full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources in these cases we work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business and thereby to help support the local community and economy is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sources every source is tested by an approved external laboratory which is capable of reporting drinking water testing results the test protocol is based on the most current revision of the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality and also includes testing required by local authorities every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified which includes using government accredited recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of roughly 100 parameterscovering many classes of raw water chemical physical constituents in addition the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be microbial and chemically safe we also believe that protection of water at the source is important accordingly a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel which covers areas such as water source selection well construction and source protection at every plant the incoming water is then further purified using a variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products whether these products are bottled water carbonated beverages or non carbonated drinks in addition to source qualification our plants monitor the raw in process and treated water for a core list of parameters and at frequencies ranging from hourly to daily to weekly depending on the specific parameter and application we have also established internal laboratories in the united states and europe which monitor raw treated and bottled water quality worldwide water sources for new sites each of our

framework an environmental policy and external environmental sustainability audits support our efforts ensuring that we are continually reaching for more ambitious goals water efficiency improvement in foods as compared to 2006 base year water at pepsico we are committed to minimizing our water use through greater efficiency across our operations and to ensuring that we source our water in ways that do not cause damage to local communities and ecosystems working closely with our suppliers we are finding new ways to further reduce their water usage and to help avoid water conflict with local communities electric efficiency improvement in foods in addition to our own efforts we consistently rely on partnerships that help us address the world is environmental challenges these relationships with a range of external stakeholders provide us with additional insights expertise and knowledge on multiple aspects of sustainability we will continue to actively lead and engage in key private public partnerships to spur collaborative action and solutions that address the urgency of these issues as compared to 2006 base year fuel efficiency improvement in foods as compared to 2006 base year pepsico also collaborates with corporate peers to ensure that we are doing more collectively to reduce our impact on the environment in 2008 indra nooyi our chairman and chief executive officer joined select global leaders as a signatory to the united nations ceo water mandate and we are actively involved in supporting all elements of the mandate through the work of the pepsico foundation we continue to invest in sustainable water resource management methods which positively impact both quantity and quality of water supply since 2005 the foundation and pepsico corporate contributions have committed more than 15 million to organizations working to bring safe water to developing countries climate change we are working hard to reduce our use of energy and transform our businesses by replacing our existing use of oil gas and fossil fuels in manufacturing with renewable energy sources 27 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 we are actively moving towards having all our new facilities meet the u s green building council is usgbc leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards one of the world is most rigorous standards for green building in an industry leading move we introduced our sustainable engineering guidelines seg based on leed standards these guidelines ensure our buildings are constructed to environmentally sustainable standards and apply to all new construction as well as major remodels of existing buildings globally where practical by consistently making our manufacturing operations more environmentally responsible we are also making them more economically efficient through our water and energy conservation processes and teams for example the frito lay plant in modesto calif installed a solar energy generating system that powers the daily production of thousands of bags of sunchips multigrain snacks in casa grande ariz our teams are working toward the goal of taking the frito lay plant there off the power grid or nearly so and running it almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water agriculture guided by our global sustainable agriculture policy pepsico is working across the agricultural supply chain to ensure our practices are efficient and sustainable continuous benchmarking against our industry peers ensures we are adopting best practices including water savings techniques waste reuse soil protection and chemical use throughout the diverse aspects of our business one of the most exciting developments in our environmental sustainability efforts has been on the packaging front in 2008we introduced a new half liter bottle for our aquafina flavored waters lipton iced teas and tropicana juice drinks the new bottle contains 20 less plastic than the previous bottle and its label is 10 smaller than before these innovations are taking nearly 6 million kilograms of packaging out of the system each year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 18000 metric tons annually that is equivalent to taking 3350 cars off the road annually environmental sustainability our goal is to design and develop packaging systems that are environmentally responsible throughout their entire life cycle we want to inspire consumers who are seeking ways to live more environmentally sustainable lives by promoting recycling in addition we want to partner with leading organizations to promote sustainable packaging and recycling practices most recently we have launched a global sustainable packaging policy and formed a sustainable packaging council to further our efforts in this area pepsico is commitment to

using it on all capital expenditure requests over 5 million each request must include a review of the sustainability issues and opportunities surrounding the request the goal is to incorporate sustainability aspects into projects right from the start and track sustainability related capital spending across pepsico this process is expected to help drive continued improvement education and awareness engaging employees we are committed to educating our associates on the importance of environmental sustainability in addition to regular training of environmental personnel we conduct special events at which new ideas are shared in may 2008 pepsico introduced the sustainable engineering guidelines which are meant to support overall implementation of our environmental sustainability design principles throughout the engineering process and to improve efficiency in the use of natural resources the sustainable engineering guidelines can be accessed through a website available to all pepsico employees and key partners worldwide we also offer workshops on recon our global eco efficiency strategy for resource conservation within our operations to our engineersfacility operations teams bottlers and co packers around the world environmental sustainability is shared with all our associates through special activities to mark events such as earth day and world water week environmental information is also included in our daily e newsletter our pepsico americas beverages businesses have quarterly employee e newsletters dedicated to sharing environmental sustainability initiatives and projects in the region as well as showcasing best practices in 2008 u s employees were offered chronos an e learning tutorial designed to help associates understand the landscape of sustainability and the business case for sustainable development it was created through a partnership with the world business council on sustainable development wbcsd and the university of cambridge u k green teams frito lay north america maintains a dedicated team of experts across our manufacturing facilities focused on reducing consumption of electricity fuels and water through greenteams made up of groups of volunteer employeesmore than 12000 manufacturing associates have been trained to improve their environmental awareness and to understand how they can do their jobs without adversely impacting the environment quaker tropicana and gatorade have established pepsico green chicago an overarching environmental sustainability initiative to raise employee awareness and create actionable tactics to improve the business and each associate is personal environmental footprint the focus is to raise awareness incite action and institutionalize sustainability improvement efforts across pepsico in september 2008 our headquarters building in chicago opened a company first sustainability centerdedicated to performance with purpose the center designed to platinum leed commercial interior standards is used to educate and inform employees about pepsico sustainability initiatives business progress and personal actions they can take at home to reduce their footprint environmental sustainability rice is india is largest grain crop and uses the bulk of fresh water used in indian agriculture in 2008direct seeding was extended to more than 1000 acres in five states and saved close to water use in manufacturing was reduced by over billion liters of water 30 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 and in the last three years we saved more than billion liters of water pepsico workers in punjab india tend to rice fields that were planted using the direct seeding method a unique and highly water efficient approach to rice cultivation environmental sustainability water pioneering initiatives to achieve positive water balance reduced water use by more than 55 and in the last three years we have saved more than 25 billion liters of water through conservation efforts we have also prevented depletion of ground water aquifers by constructing rainwater harvesting systems in most of our plants water is required to make our products so that we maintain the highest quality standards for consumers and water is required to ensure a clean and safe workplace for our employees and our suppliers in turn efficient use of water across our operations is nothing short of imperative we are committed to minimizing our global water use through greater efficiency innovative processes and new technologies one of the most effective initiatives is our work with farmers to reduce water intensity in rice cultivation through a method called direct seeding our india team has become a leading proponent of direct seeding of rice versus transplanting seedlings from nurseries to paddies that are then flooded while direct seeding of rice is done in some countries it is not widely practiced in india in 2008 we conserved more than 75 billion liters of water as a result of gains in water efficiency from the 2006 baseline and while using water responsibly is a top priority we also believe in our ability to help address the broader challenge of water scarcity and to help avoid water conflicts in local communities in india pepsico has been experimenting with direct seeding for four years testing methods to improve yield and reduce weed growth and even developing a tractor mounted direct seeding machine adjustable for seed variety planting depth and plant to plant spacing in india all industry accounts for about 6 of total water use within that 6 the soft drinks and bottled water industry accounts for about four hundredths of 1 in comparisonagriculture accounts for over 80 of total fresh water use in the country to have significant impact on total water conservation farming must use water more efficiently we believe we can play an important role in providing solutions in 2003 our india team embarked on an ambitious journey to achieve positive water balance giving back as much as we take through a comprehensive program to conserve and optimize water usage we have pioneered major initiatives by partnering with farmers working with numerous rural communities and establishing private public partnerships with punjab agriculture university and the energy resources institute teri we have carried out a variety of innovative reuse and recycling initiatives within our own operations raised farm productivity which increased farmers incomes and improved the quality of life in many communities these initiatives among others will help us make significant progress toward positive water balance in 2009 in the last five years our india manufacturing team has 31 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 after carrying out initial direct seeding trials at our own model farms pilot tests have been run in farmers fields to confirm the results in 2008 direct seeding was extended to more than 1000 acres in five states and the initiative saved close to 1 billion liters of water in addition to saving water it also reduced costs by 1400 rupees per acre for farmers direct seeding will go a long way in enabling our india team to achieve positive water balance for our beverage business by 2009 more important it has the potential to dramatically reduce water usage in a country where water is an increasingly precious commodity this single initiative is an example of both climate change mitigation and adaptation we are mitigating our impacts on climate change by using significantly less resourcesand helping our farm communities adapt to the changing environment in india pepsico has been experimenting with direct seeding one of the most effective ways to reduce water use in rice cultivation shown here is a direct seeding machine adjustable for seed variety planting depth and plant to plant spacing conserving water in our operations one of the most important elements of sustainable water conservation is in plant water conservation to formalize this in our manufacturing facilities and embed conservation practices into the day to day operations of the plant we have developed the water component of our successful energy resource conservation recon tool like the energy tool the water tool includes a pc or web based diagnostic with audit guidance and solution sets with this tool the manufacturing facility can conduct a self audit of its water management practices to complement the water recon tool we have developed a water profiler which will map and quantify all major water uses within the facility identify relative local costs of these applications and identify a hot list of water conservation measures that can be implemented both short and long term we estimate that in general application of the water recon tool in a plant will result in a 10 to 20 reduction in water use the tool is now being expanded to our franchise bottler network and our co packer partners we have instituted a number of other technological improvements in our global manufacturing operations to save water environmental sustainability in the u k our total water use across all our foods and snacks operations was 14 billion liters in 2008 between 2001 and 2008 we reduced the water used to manufacture walkers crisps by nearly 60 from 13 l kg of production to 54 l kg the walkers team developed engineering solutions to reduce equipment water use and created sources for recycled water frito lay the u s snack division of pepsico continued to improve its water efficiency by conserving over 380 million gallons 1 billion liters of water in 2008 as compared to 2006 through its continued water conservation efforts known as the gallon per pound challenge frito lay won recognition from the environmental protection agency as a water efficiency leader in 2007 in 2008 our latin american operations participated in the inter american water day an awareness campaign aimed at raising awareness of the growing scarcity of potable water in the region and the importance of water conservation the program also had a volunteering component where pepsico employees visited schools to teach children about water conservation in addition in 2008 latin american beverages manufacturing operations saved 28 million liters of water both in companyowned and franchise business as part of the same initiativewe also saved 31415 mwhr of electricity in our latin america beverage manufacturing operations in 2008 pepsico reinforced its commitment to science and the environment through water conservation by using waterless rinsing technology at gatorade is u s plants using air rinsing on all of our gatorade and propel lines the water savings are more than 5 million liters of water per year pepsi cola franchise bottlers in north america are also doing their part pepsi bottling group has installed reverse osmosis recovery systems or incorporated high recovery designs into their new manufacturing lines that cumulatively save more than 1 billion liters of water annually as compared to traditional designs 32 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 how we source water water quality across pepsico we have a variety of standardized processes and procedures to assure the safety of our consumersintegrity of our products and respect for the environment and community around us for new sites each of our businesses applies the elements of an environmental site assessmentsimilar to the american society for testing and materials astm standards for environmental site assessments our u s facilities are primarily supplied by municipal water sources as such these sources comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide consumer confidence reports ccr which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with epa quality requirements the water quality data is available from the municipal water purveyors whether the purchaser is pepsicoone of our franchise partners or a home consumer with specific regard to water sources we utilize a mixture of municipal supplies which may be from surface or groundwater sources and private wells in addition water resource selection at new sites is included in a pepsico wide web based tool called the pepsico sustainable engineering guidelines this pan enterprise effort captures all critical areas of new facility construction and provides solution sets for the user who encounters water related or other risks in addition the ttool provides a fast track path to leed certification pepsico was a full supporter and advisory board member in the development of a water resource assessment tool by the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd in conjunction with a globally recognized environmental consulting firm this tool was launched to global acclaim in stockholm in 2007 and updated in 2009 this risk mapping and management tool provides an assessment of relative water availability abundance stress scarcity for any physical location coordinates entered in addition to a wealth of other water related information to the best of our knowledge this was the first comprehensive tool of its kind that was entered into the public domain completely free of charge for use by any and all business sectors governments ngos and other stakeholders we are currently mapping all pepsico facilities across the worldand both current and projected risk of water stress are being identified and evaluated by a doctoral level dedicated senior manager of water stewardship in addition this high level assessment will be cascaded to our field operations for the next level of watershed risk assessment at the local level similarly outside the united states many of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources and the same approach would apply in areas of the world where we develop our own water sources for example extraction from commercial wells we do so in full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources in these caseswe work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business and thereby help support the local community and economy is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sources every source is tested by an approvedexternal laboratory that is capable of reporting drinking water testing results the test protocol is based on the most current revision of the world health organization guidelines for drinking water quality and also includes testing required by local authorities worldwide every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified which includes using government accredited recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of over 100 parameters covering many classes of raw water chemical physical constituents in addition the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be safe we also believe that protection of water at the source is important accordingly a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel which covers areas such as water source selectionwell construction and source protection at every plant the incoming water is then further purified using a variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products environmental sustainability whether these products are bottled water carbonated beverages or non carbonated drinks in addition to source qualification our plants monitor the raw in process and treated water for a core list of parameters and at frequencies ranging from hourly to daily to weekly depending on the specific parameter and application we have also established internal laboratories in the united states and europe which routinely monitor raw treated and bottled water quality worldwide once the water source is adequately identified for capacity and tested for quality conserving the amount of water used in our plants becomes a critical component of stewardship we seek to minimize our impact through traditional efforts to protect what we use we follow the u s epa guidelines common to other governments as well to reduce reuse and recycle water whenever possible at discharge pepsico recognizes that regulations vary considerably across the globe and that some may not be adequate from the perspective of responsible water stewardship consequently we have developed and implemented the pepsico wide responsible standards for effluent which ensure environmentally safe responsible treatment and discharge of our process water waste streams across the world in addition to including and complying with local regulations these internal pepsico standards are also included in the twelve element system wide environmental health safety management system framework ehsms this combined ehsms framework is compatible with iso 14001 for environmental management systems and ohsas 18001 for occupational health and safety management systems more than 30 pepsico facilities have achieved formal iso 14001 certification and five have received formal certification to ohsas 18001 partnering for change water is unique in that it sits squarely at the nexus of climate change food security gender empowerment education and global health consequently pepsico believes that we have an obligation to positively impact the water crisis in its many

wef water advisory group to develop a technical white paper on the topic of water use in agriculture industry and global health the intent was to use this as a vehicle targeted at the 1000 ceo audience to place the global water crisis squarely at the center of attention and debate world business council for sustainable development wbcsd pepsico plays an active role in the wbcsd is water core working group which developed the wbcsd water resource risk tool and which was launched at world water week in stockholm in august of 2007 and re launched with a more robust watershed database in 2009 pepsico subject matter experts played a significant role in the development of the white paper agricultural ecosystems facts and trends which highlights the myriad environmental issues where agriculture is connected beverage industry environmental roundtable bier acknowledging that conservation and stewardship efforts within our facilities are foundational to engagement in the environmental sustainability space leading companies like pepsico have an obligation to help inform and positively influence broader industry efforts as well bier is an example of this broader leadership bier was formed in 2006 with the mission of defining both qualitatively and quantitatively what environmental stewardship entails bier consists of peer and competitor companies across soft drink bottled water brewery and distilled spirits sectors of the industry that have aligned specific tangible deliverables to help advance the collective industry world water day in 2008 as in previous years we were active supporters of world water day our most visible activity was with ethos water which is a part of the pepsico water family ethos water has a unique business model which includes helping to raise awareness of the severity of the world water crisis pepsico is helping to increase the distribution of ethos water for each bottle of ethos water sold in the u s starbucks

earth institute in 2008 the earth institute at columbia university one of the world is premier institutions dedicated to global sustainable development and the pepsico foundation entered into a 6 million three year partnership the program includes a series of high impact community based activities and practical solutions across water agriculture and climate water org in 2008 the pepsico foundation made a 41 million grant to waterpartners to provide safe drinking water and sanitation to communities of the greatest need in india this grant was the biggest single contribution to water org is watercredit initiative an innovative program that uses microfinance to increase access to safe water and improve sanitation for local communities in india the project will directly impact a minimum of 120000 lives approximately 60000 people will be served through traditional grantswhile an additional 60000 people will be served through watercredit women and children comprise an estimated 68 of this total it is anticipated that there will be a natural multiplier effect that will widen the impact of this commitment to a larger number of beneficiaries throughout the recipient communities safe water network through a three year partnership with safe water network the pepsico foundation pledged 35 million to implement safe water initiatives for village water systems in ghana india and bangladesh as well as rainwater harvesting systems in india environmental sustainability agriculture distribution use and disposal including processing and packaging the carbon footprint for a 64 ounce carton of tropicana pure premium orange juice 35 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 tropicana is calculating the amount of greenhouse gases produced during the manufacturing and use of its tropicana pure premium orange juice environmental sustainability climate change purchased electricity for manufacturing distribution centers and offices understanding our brands carbon footprint purchased steam for manufacturing operations climate change may adversely affect the raw materials and other supplies we use to make our products including water and various crops from potato oats and corn to oranges and apples the data shown above excludes additional greenhouse gas data that has been estimated for the first time in 2008 including throughout our business an important part of our greenhouse gas ghg emissions results from the energy used in our manufacturing and related processes we are reducing our emissions through more efficient use of non renewable fuels and increased use of renewable energy we also partner with non governmental organizations to examine how our business impacts climate change and how we can change the way we work to further reduce our footprint company owned international fleet and fugitive operations 490600000 metric tons co2e company owned coolers and vending machines 761000000 metric tons co2e note pepsico has reported emissions from these companyowned coolers and vending machines as scope 3 to be consistent with how these types of emissions sources have historically been reported by the beverage sector however since 2000 walkers has reduced its energy use per pack by one third and reduced water use by the 2008 ghg data presented in the chart above has gone through 3rd party verification and represents nearly 85 of total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions for pepsico this data is comparable to the 2006 and 2007 data reported for trending scope 1 and scope 2 emissions include the following for company owned operations fuel combusted during manufacturing calculated by standard emissions factors according to each fuel fuel combusted for building heat emissions from fleet vehicles based on vehicle type fuel type and volume of fuel used fugitive emissions from refrigeration units at manufacturing sites based on leak rates and refrigerant purchases 36 pepsico corporate citizenship report 2008 based on careful review of the world resources institute greenhouse gas protocol in our opinion it is not clear that scope 3 is the most appropriate designation in 2009 pepsico will work with relevant third party experts and stakeholders in the beverage sector to develop formal guidance for designation of these source types statement from bureau veritas in 2003 we began working with the carbon trust an independent not for profit company set up by the u k government to help businesses address the growing threat of global climate change and to pioneer carbon footprinting methodology and standards the carbon trust believes that in order to effectively reduce a company is carbon footprint they must first know how to accurately measure it we began the work with our leading crisp brand in the u k walkers crisps following months of intense research walkers became the first consumer brand to pilot the original method for assessing product carbon footprints and the first major food brand to display a carbon footprint reduction label on its packs since 2000 walkers has reduced its energy use per pack by onethird and its water use by 42 and it is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its products even further the collaborative work continued and most recently tropicana pure premium orange juice became the first consumer brand in north america to be independently certified by the carbon trust the process included working with an academic research partner the earth institute at columbia university to determine the mapping process the carbon trust then conducted a review of scientific life cycle data and certified the carbon footprint of a standard 64 ounce carton by mapping the product life cycle from growing and squeezing oranges and getting the container on the shelves to finally disposing or recycling the packaging looking at the energy consumption directly involved in each of these life cycle stages and converting this into equivalent carbon dioxide emissions co2e adding the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions co2e from each stage to estimate the total product greenhouse gas footprint of the product using this process the estimated carbon footprint for a 64 ounce carton was determined to be 17 kilograms the carbon trust has certified the footprint giving pepsico a verifiable benchmark against which the company can measure ghg reduction progress going forward in coming years additional products including pepsi diet pepsiaquafina and gatorade will be assessed today more than 10 products that represent a true market basket of our consumer offerings are currently being evaluated for a carbon footprint this science based information is helping our businesses target operational improvements and achieve their energy efficiency goals while striving for even more ambitious environmental sustainability yet realistic targets uncovering information about where and why carbon is generated in the manufacturing distribution and disposal of products will also help drive collaboration with partners and suppliers on carbon reduction initiatives and elevate consumer awareness reducing our energy use each division of pepsico is committed to achieving the 2015 reduction targets and has developed customized tactics to ensure their achievement continued energy efficiency improvements to minimize energy intensity of our productsdevelopment of additional renewable energy generation at our own facilities support for renewable energy generation outside our facilities through the purchase of renewable energy certificates and working cooperatively with our supply chain partners to share best practices in energy efficiency and sustainability improvement large reductions in the use of non renewable energy in the future will require innovative technologies hastening the development and application of these technologies will take bold steps such as the one frito lay has begun in an attempt to transform their casa grande ariz facility to a net zero manufacturing facility the goal of this project is to dramatically reduce the use of nonrenewable energy and water at an existing plant through implementation of transformational technology the first stage will involve installation of a water recovery and reuse process that is expected to reduce water consumption by over 80 this project is under way with planned start up in 2010 the

citizenship report 2008 download our sustainable agriculture policy pepsico has implemented numerous strategies at the regional and brand levels to support and drive our agricultural and environmental policies several more are highlighted below as they relate to each of the six objectives 1 water management pepsico aims to optimize the applied water footprint to crops and to reduce water waste during irrigation as well as responsibly manage runoff risks of pollution or contamination of ground or surface water with pesticides nutrients or soil in china pepsico invested in a potato farm in the inner mongolian desert we installed the necessary infrastructure roads electric supply water conserving pivot irrigatorsand soil conserving crops sea willows trees to protect from erosion due to sandstorms by partnering with the local farmers we established a rotation of commercially viable crops winter wheat potato sorghum and corn with an initial water savings of 50 by moving from traditional flood irrigation to pivot we are continuing this evolution from pivot to drip irrigation with the aim of conserving 70 of the water needed over traditional farming methods the equivalent of avoiding additional water consumption of nearly 025 billion liters per year for the operation a critical component of the community engagement portion of this project besides the farmer interest is the installation of local libraries to promote literacy and education in the communities 2 soil conservation and preservation pepsico aims to preserve and improve soil fertility and nutrients minimize soil loss through erosion and avoid soil damage due to disease and contamination frito lay north america has developed and implemented protocols to wash potatoes at the farm to reduce eliminate the residual soil shipped to our plants thereby allowing this soil to be redistributed at the farm rather than disposed of through the plants waste water discharge and also reducing diesel fuel requirements in china through various collaborations our foods team is successfully growing potatoes under desert conditions pepsico installed the infrastructure needed for transportation planted erosion protective crops and replaced the traditional practice of flood irrigation with water sparing pivots by utilizing in plant conservation approaches coupled with the installation of pivot irrigation systems in 2006 our china team saved over a billion liters of water compared to the prior year the china team is also evolving further from pivot to drip irrigation in 2008with the aim of reaching 70 water conservation for these systems as part of this collaborative effort with the communities our local business is also building libraries for local children to improve their education and literacy in brazil a soil conservation initiative for potatoes has been ongoing and involves minimal soil preparation to reduce soil degradation along with a fuel consumption analysis to decrease fuel use by reducing tractor use and machinery size sustainability benefits reduced soil erosion water use and diesel consumption along with reduced potato losses due to soilborne diseases resulting in a 5 water reduction and 20 savings on irrigation costs 3 agrochemical management pepsico aims to reduce the use of pesticides nutrients and other agrochemicals by optimizing agricultural operations pepsico supports sustainable practices that substitute natural controls for agrochemicals foster ecosystem balance reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and reduce crop losses frito lay north america initiated an organic line of snacks including tostitos organic blue corn tortilla chips cheetos natural white cheddar puffs and lay is natural country bbq potato chips the company will follow the u s department of agriculture is standards in labeling organic products environmental sustainability frito lay has also developed potato varieties that store longer and are resistant to disease and better adapted to adverse climatic conditions allowing frito lay north america to grow its potatoes in the most efficient agronomic areas in the u s this results in higher production per acre which minimizes the use of all farm inputs including energy water fertilizer pesticides and herbicides in saudi arabia and egypt climate and soil moisture measurement and recording systems were implemented to potato crop fields to forecast blight disease with a view toward more optimized use of chemicals this has resulted in fewer chemicals being used and greater disease control these systems are now also installed in pakistan 4 energy management pepsico aims to optimize the use of energy in crop production and management of agricultural waste to improve economics for the farm and reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions quaker supplies over 200 million pounds of oat hulls as raw material ingredients and as a renewable source of fuel for the generation of steam at the university of iowa one hundred percent of the oat hulls are utilized as either a raw material or fuel source reducing dependence on less renewable sources of fuel generation of steam through use of oat hulls as fuel source reduces dependence and use of non renewable fuel sources 5 farm economics and land management pepsico supports sustainable agriculture practices that enable farmers to improve product value by maximizing the desired outputs of an agricultural system while minimizing the required inputs and avoiding any negative impacts to the farm and surrounding environment pepsico

commitment foundation hwcf is a powerful example of our commitment to making a difference the organization brings together a network of more than 255 retailers food and beverage manufacturersrestaurants sporting goods and insurance companies and trade associations to help reduce obesity especially childhood obesity for example the together counts program is an hwcf public education campaign that has raised awareness about the importance of achieving an active healthy lifestyle with nearly 15 million u s students pepsico and the pepsico foundation contributed a total of

the 16 food and beverage companies that are members of hwcf had reduced 64 trillion calories from the marketplace in 2012 compared to 2007 in the u s this achievement well exceeded their commitment to collectively reduce 15 trillion calories from the food supply by 2015 this reduction equates to 78 calories per person per day in the u s product choice the hwcf calorie reduction achievement is proof

and saturated fats and developing a broader portfolio of product choices for the past five years we have been working to deliver great tasting snacks with lower levels of sodium and saturated fats and delicious beverages with fewer or no added sugars physical activity event sponsored by the healthy weight commitment foundation we are continuing to work toward our ambitious reduction goals in sodium saturated fats and added sugars even though progress in some areas is slower than we would like human sustainability goals our human sustainability goals are as follows reduce the average amount of saturated fats per serving in key global food brands in key countries by 15 percent by 2020 against a 2006 baseline reduce the average amount of added sugars per serving in key global beverage brands in key countries by 25 percent by 2020 against a 2006 baseline reduce the average amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands in key countries by 25 percent by 2020 against a 2006 baseline 6 this goal was reset to 2020 after strategic review of sodium reduction progress see page 17 for a full discussion in our last report we added a calculation of tonnage removed using the standard methodology employed by hwcf while a global average per serving reduction metric provides a macro view of our progress we believe that sharing market level data gives stakeholders a better understanding of where our efforts are taking hold and so both are used in this report pepsico sustainability report 2013 like many other companies we used our first round of goal setting to set stretch commitments in order to inspire activity and assure that we took action to identify challenges we face on our journey we remain steadfastly committed to these reductions in added sugars saturated fats and sodium and believe we will ultimately be successful despite challenges affecting our rates of progress 14 pepsico sustainability report 2013 pepsico offers three distinct product

the 2006 baseline saturated fat on a global average per serving basis we have reduced saturated fats by approximately 3 percent compared to the 2006 baseline in 2013 we removed more than 2100 metric tons of saturated fats from key global brands in key markets as compared to 2006 one challenge to meeting our saturated fats reduction goal is higher volume growth in developing and emerging markets where healthier oils are less accessible and more costly which has slowed progress against our reduction goal we continue to monitor our progress closely and are aggressively exploring healthier oil options in our developing and emerging markets we are seeing tremendous potential to expedite our progress with changes in how we produce our products and the oil we use for examplein the u s we have reduced the saturated fats content of lay is and ruffles by 45 percent and 34 percent respectively since 2006 by switching from cottonseed oil to a blend of sunflower and other oils in 2013 we launched three air popped potato chip products with walkers pops in the u k smith is popped in australia and lay is air pops in the u s in addition we are exploring new technologiessuch as air popping to provide lower fat options in 2013 and early 2014 we successfully created three air popped potato chip products with the launch of walkers pops in the u k smith is popped in australia and lay is air pops in the u s air popped chips have a crispy and crunchy texture with half the fat of regular potato chips these innovations in production recipes and technology are a testament to our commitment to

introduction of new products as well as volume shifts for key brands in our portfolio we removed approximately 402000 metric tons of added sugars from our total beverage portfolio in north america u s and canada as compared to 2006 reducing added sugars in key global brands has continued to be challenging but we are making progress in places such as russia brazilsaudi arabia the u k and canada in 2013the u k launched trop50 with 50 percent less sugar than regular tropicana and russia launched lipton ice tea with 30 percent less sugar than regular lipton ice tea pepsico mexico reduced sugar in both mirinda and manzanita sol by 25 percent per serving our commitment to reduce added sugars continues to be challenging because of consumer preference and a global trend away from existing diet sodas consumers in many major markets are demanding natural alternatives to low calorie sweeteners andas a result we have accelerated our research and technology investments to address this pepsi cola products philippines associate at a bottling plant in san fernando the philippines demand sweeteners naturally low in caloriessuch as stevia are becoming increasingly available for example pepsi next in australiafrance canada and the netherlands is made with stevia and is a step toward achieving a meaningful reduction in added sugars we continue to explore ways to reduce added sugars through

foods that are better for you in 2013 pepsico mexico reduced sugar in mirinda by 25 per serving sodium we have made progress on all of our goals however we have more work to do to meet our sodium reduction goal we believe that we will be successful but that it will take more time than originally anticipated as a result we have extended the deadline to 2020 which is in line with target dates for reductions in saturated fats and added sugars we are also committed to supporting the world health organization is who sodiumreduction strategies called for in the who global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013 2020 and we continue to work toward further sodium reduction in our products to that end we have achieved noteworthy success in sodium reductions in individual markets for example in china and the u k we already met the 25 percent sodiumreduction target compared to our 2006 baseline pepsico brazil canada mexico and russia have each achieved more than 10 percent sodium reduction in key brands compared to their respective 2006 baselines these countries have taken the lead globally in our sodium reduction efforts and set the example for what is possible as we look to leverage our global scale and integrate their best practices we continue to prioritize the reduction of sodium in our flavored products and in 2013mexico

weaving sustainability into the very fabric of our organization is a way to help f uture proof our business for the changing world around us at pepsico we focus on three pillars of sustainability human environmental and talent we are working to improve the nutritional profile of our products and offer a wider selection of nutritious foods and beverages in response to growing consumer demand we are striving to reduce our impact on the environment and conserve natural resourcesreducing our operating costs in the process and we are continuously investing to build a diverse and engaging culture inside pepsico that allows us to attract the next generation of talent we need to propel our company forward these three pillars form the foundation of what we call performance with purpose and they help to drive our financial results the report that follows describes the significant progress we made in each of these areas in 2014 we are particularly proud to report that pepsico achieved four of our environmental goals ahead of schedule as one of north america is largest fleet operators pepsico utilizes all electric and hybrid trucks and uses alternative fuels to increase efficiency and cut emissions it is clear that in the years and decades aheadthe private sector will be increasingly impacted by global environmental and social challenges that no single company industry government or nongovernmental organization ngo can address alone collaborative solutions in which we all play our role hold the key to meaningful and lasting progress the strongest cross sector partnerships flourish when each member engages in constructive dialogue this dialogue is at times lacking today for example the relationship between corporations and some ngos can be purely adversarial while ngos should absolutely push hard for companies to change they should also acknowledge when companies set thoughtful goals and take serious steps to achieve them we share many common objectives and must find more opportunities to join hands rather than simply pointing fingers for our part pepsico is fully committed to engaging partners who seek progress on our shared challenges we are proud of the relationships we have built with many highly respected organizations around the world moving forward we intend to expand and strengthen these partnerships the ngo community brings in depth experience and local knowledge that is critical to solving big problems and we will continue seeking new opportunities to work together on topics most significant to our business and on which we can make a meaningful impact simply put we need cooperation at all levels as such the private sector must step forward and offer its unique capabilities to develop new solutions uncover new opportunities

and wellness challenges in malnutrition and health and wellness are having a significant impact on societies around the world according to the world food programme enough food is made to feed everyone around the world yet nearly 900 million people still go to bed hungry each night mostly in emerging markets at the same time we know from the world health organization who that in developed countries more than 19 billion adults were overweight in 2014 studies link the growing rates of over nutrition and obesity worldwide to a rise in chronic diseases such as cancercardiovascular disease and diabetes against this troubling backdrop many consumers are increasingly focused on making more nutritious or informed choices when shopping for food and beverages yet this task is often met with mixed messaging around dietary guidelines ingredients and processes from different authorities and stakeholders around the world the truth is that what we choose to eat and drink is inherently cultural and extremely personal trying to make the right decisions on what to feed ourselves and our families has never been more complicated at m re fin e pr our ov po id e c rtfo l le ar io c ho n ut ic ri tio es n in fo r today pepsico is world class research development r d team is advancing our work in this area driving innovation across our product portfolios and creating new opportunities

to support collaborative solutions as one of the world is leading food and beverage companies we at pepsico are taking steps to enable consumers to make more informed choices and we are looking to capture the growth opportunity presented by offering more nutritious options in fact in 2014 about 20 percent of our net revenues came from our nutrition businesses we continue to focus on ways to reduce sodium added sugars and saturated fats in our foods and beverages we also work to clearly label what is in our products and we aim to sell and market our products responsibly especially when it comes to young consumers we call this focus on our products human sustainability pepsico sustainability report 2014 pepsico turkey has delivered reductions in sodium saturated fats and added sugars and offers a range of convenient products including tropicana which uses popular local fruits human sustainability for more information see our microsite human sustainability is our strategic approach to health and nutrition in our product portfolio and is a key pillar of performance with purpose in 2009 pepsico set ambitious human sustainability goals underpinned by metrics and policiesand we are pleased to share our progress with you below continue to refine our food and beverage choices to meet changing consumer needs by reducing sodiumadded sugars and saturated fats and developing a broader portfolio of product choices 02 sodium our 2020 goal is to reduce the average sodium 10 amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands in key countries by 25 percentcompared to a 2006 baseline in 2014 all 10 key countries we track for these goals achieved sodium reductions in fact through 2014 china and the u k have already met our 25 percent reduction target in key brands on a global average per serving basis we reduced sodium by more than 10 percent and removed more than 1800 metric tons from key global food brands in key countries in 2014 compared to 2006 advances in manufacturing technology and recipe innovation have helped us maintain the taste our consumers expect while reducing sodium content our primary challenge in meeting this goal is consumer acceptance of reduced sodium products in countries like the u s and saudi arabiaand we continue to prioritize its reduction in our flavored chips as some seasonings can be high in sodium we will continue to invest in r d toward sodium reductions to help people achieve levels recommended by public health experts such as the who added sugars we set a goal to reduce the average amount of added sugars per serving in our beverages in key countries by 25 percent by 2020 compared to a 2006 baseline although our goal with respect to reducing added sugars applies only to key global beverage brands we measure our progress against all beverage brands seven of the 10 key countries we track for this goal have reduced added sugars in 2014 compared to our 2006 baseline two of these seven key countries added sugars pepsico sustainability report 2014 the u s and canada together reported removing approximately 434000 metric tons of added sugars from the total beverage portfolioup from 402000 in 2013 as a result of actively managing the portfolio and offering a mix of products despite this progress on a global average basis we saw a net increase in metric tons of added sugars in 2014 in certain key countries while there have been some successful products with reduced added sugars the original versions of our products are growing at faster rates due in part to consumer preference this increases the average added sugars per serving and thereby impacts the aggregated average our greatest challenges in meeting this goal will be our performance in india and china where the markets are growing so rapidly that it is more difficult to predict sales and consumer acceptability we are accelerating r d investments to uncover and develop great tasting sweeteners and flavors that are inherently low in calories and that we believe will enable us to make progress toward this goal saturated fats we set a goal of reducing the average amount of saturated fats per serving in key global food brands in key countries by 15 percent by 2020 compared to a 2006 baseline five of the 10 countries we measure against this goal have already met the 15 percent target and turkey has removed 35 percent of the saturated fats from its key brands in 2014 compared to 2006 on a global average per serving basis we reduced saturated fats by just over 2 percent and removed 1600 metric tons of saturated fats in 2014 compared to the 2006 baseline higher volume growth in markets where healthier oils are less accessible has proven to be a challenge for us and we continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce saturated fats and use healthier oils in our products 10 of our key countries have reduced average added sugars per serving in 2014 compared to our 2006 baseline broadening our portfolio in 2014 approximately 20 percent of net revenue came from pepsico is nutrition businesses we plan to further expand our more nutritious portfolio by building on our e xpertise in dairy hummus and baked grain

by 2030 it is expected that greater demand for food will require an increase in production of 50 percent or a substantial reduction in the amount of food currently wasted or lost 35 50 percent throughout the value chain and if ghg emissions continue unabated global average temperatures could exceed a rise of 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels by 2045 the 2 c increase is regarded by the scientific community as the upper limit to minimize exposure to increasingly dangerous forest fires extreme weather drought and other impacts moreover these acute global problems will need to be addressed all while demand for the world is resources is increasing at an unprecedented rate managing the interrelationship between agriculture climate change energy and water will be crucial for

customers investors communities governments and ngos demand action they want a more focused more integrated approach that places sustainability at the heart of business operations at pepsi co we recognize that the futures of our company communities and planet are all inextricably linked that reality has been driven home again and again in recent years first by the covid 19 pandemic then the deadly conflict in ukraine through it all climate change has continued to increase its impact on our fragile ecosystems leading to extreme weather crop failures and changes in the range and abundance of certain plants and animals all of these issues have resulted in a collision of food shortages supply chain bottlenecks and a refugee crisis unlike anything europe has seen since world war ii in this context we have been thinking hard about what it means to be a truly sustainable company one that creates growth and value for all of our stakeholders we know that to be successful five years 10

approach pep pillars our agricultural footprint covers approximately 7 million acres and our supply chain supports more than 100 000 agricultural jobs worldwide we work with tens of thousands of farmers to source more than 25 crops and ingredients from more than 30 countries around the world the goal is a sustainable food system that respects natural resources and makes a positive impact on the people and communities we work with and serve it s better for people better for the planet and better for our business we are taking a landscape approach to advancing regenerative agriculture marked by collaboration between stakeholders within a designated region often spanning multiple crops sectors and land uses to advance shared sustainability goals while reconciling and optimizing multiple social economic and environmental objectives and because real change requires long term consistent effort we have launched several initiatives tackling some of our key commodities with this approach in the midwest u s mexico and southeast asia and plan to expand into new priority landscapes as we progress on our positive agriculture journey pepsi co s business starts with agriculture a steady sustainable supply of crops is central to our business positive agriculture 1 2 2021 pepsi co esg summary agriculture climate related impacts like excessive heat drought or flooding can impact

regenerative agriculture metric in 2021 progress presented here reflects our first year tracking this metric and builds on years of partnership and investment in sustainable agriculture 3 definitions of regenerative agriculture vary and we re working across stakeholder groups to align on a standard definition 4 in the u s we helped farmers plant cover crops on over 85 000 acres an example of how using this regenerative agriculture practice can result in up to a 38 net reduction in on farm greenhouse gas ghg emissions including soil carbon sequestration approach we define regenerative agriculture3 as a set of farming principles and practices that improve and restore ecosystems while building resilience our approach is outcome oriented and to some extent we are practice agnostic that s because every farming community is different with different needs we re tracking how soil health greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction and carbon sequestration watershed management biodiversity and the livelihoods of agricultural workers are improving there are some practice categories we ve identified that help drive those results and we are working on scaling them regenerative techniques not only protect against soil erosion and water depletion but they can also help farmers grow more food on the same amount of land these techniques typically require fewer inputs so they can also lead to higher margins and greater profitability for our farmers in 2021 we launched an internal co investment fund to incentivize our local teams to design and scale innovative solutions that contribute to our positive agriculture agenda now in its second year the positive agriculture outcomes fund provides a unique mechanism that reduces the risk and cost of projects with long term sustainable business potential to date nearly 2 million has been granted through the fund in addition we understand societal concerns around pesticides and are actively seeking continuous improvements in agricultural practices that minimize pesticide and other agrochemical use we established a cross functional global pesticide council composed of senior leaders across key functions to evaluate pesticide issues and direct the company s policies and programs the council has developed a five year strategic plan with clear deliverables including industry benchmarking and centralized global scientific and regulatory tracking we also engage with multi stakeholder groups peer companies and ngos to develop promote and adopt best practices related to responsible use of pesticides net r

collaboration with our internal experts industry peers and cross sector partners we have developed a practice bank of those activities and practices that contribute to our regenerative agriculture goals a database that we introduced in may 2022 to our farmers and suppliers it s the reason why we joined forces with several strategic partners worldwide to understand the specific needs to fight climate change in every sector in which we operate alongside organizations such as ciat international center for tropical agriculture giz foundation for food and agriculture research u s farmers and ranchers alliance world farmers organization agro scout and others we are supporting farmers to implement adaptive practices reduce ghg emissions in agriculture and strengthen their field knowledge and management to respond quickly in a targeted way so we can all continue driving the pep agenda forward we actively support farmers in our supply chain with programs to make it easier for them to adopt regenerative practices in the u s we helped farmers plant cover crops on over 85 000 acres resulting in up to a 38 net reduction in on farm ghg emissions including soil carbon sequestration1 and provided support to more than 600 farmers in north american farmland by the end of 2021 our demonstration farms program showcases practices that are leading to the commercialization of innovative ag tech and the scaling of proven practices that lead to regenerative outcomes the demonstration farms enable the farmers we work with to share their firsthand experiences which encourages broader adoption in 2021 we worked with 20 different partners to demonstrate farming best practices in areas such as nutrients water use efficiency and precision farming in 2021 our partnerships yielded value for farmers the environment and the business percent increases observed in a control plot vs a demonstration plot in 28 demonstration farms in india we saw average yield improvements of almost 7 and reduced ghg emissions by more than 7 resulting in farmer income increase of 55 per acre on average in thailand we worked with the department of agriculture and other partners to implement integrated pest and nutrient management and install drip irrigation systems on our demonstration farms resulting in an average yield increase of 25 on seven farms a 23 carbon emissions reduction and a more than 40 reduction in water use in irrigation in mexico we demonstrated ways to save water through different irrigation techniques and improvements in existing irrigation systems we reduced water use in irrigation by 36 on average while increasing potato yields by 8 by the end of 2021 we had 72 regenerative demonstration farms as part of the program and over 600 farmers transitioned from demonstration into broader landscape impact programs to scale up proven innovation in a landscape approach farmers in a region align around shared sustainability goals and commit to specific regenerative practices pepsi co and our partners support work within the landscape to spread the adoption of regenerative agriculture and deliver outcomes such as ghg emissions reduction through funding independent advisories for farmers facilitating coaching and peer support and financially incentivizing adoption of regenerative practices as we advance on our positive agriculture journey and more farms learn the benefits of regenerative agriculture and adopt its practices we expect to continue to expand into new landscapes and grow the number of regenerative farming acres we annually report toward our goal of 7 million by 2030 in 2021 we launched several landscape initiatives tackling some of our key commodities in the midwest u s mexico and southeast asia climate resilience is also a key priority to safeguard our operations for many years to come 1 for pepsi co s corporate ghg footprint the company follows the ghg protocol framework where any sequestration is kept separate from the three scopes of emissions positive agriculture6 2021 pepsi co esg summary healthy watershed goal approach advocate for and contribute to a measurable improvement in the health of high water

be cheery 3 data for 2021 not available as we measure this at least every three years through advocacy and our own initiatives including promoting regenerative techniques we re working to measurably improve the health of high water risk watersheds where we directly source our crops and aim for a more sustainable way to use this resource at the end of 2021 we sourced approximately 40 of our grower sourced key ingredients the building blocks of our beverages and convenient foods from areas of high water risk these efforts are designed to help ensure our continued access to the water we need for production as well as preserve water access for the communities in which we operate we ve targeted a goal of improving water use efficiency by 15 by 2025 compared to a 2015 baseline throughout our operations progress against this goal is measured at least every three years and was last measured in 2020 around the world it is a common practice to use flood or trench irrigation to bring water to crops causing farmers who use these methods to potentially lose up to 70 of the water used to runoff or evaporation in the search for a better solution we partnered with n drip an israeli company whose irrigation system is powered by gravity and harnesses the water saving benefits of high pressure drip irrigation without the need for the energy costs and water filtration associated with high pressure drip irrigation pepsi co aims to scale n drip s technology to help improve farmer livelihoods with higher yields reduced water consumption and reduced ghg emissions the goal is global adoption of n drip water efficiency technology across 10 000 hectares 25 000 acres by 2025 in 2022 we plan to expand n drip in india south africa and the united states as well as kick off a pilot in greece the n drip cost share project in india was made possible as a result of a grant from the positive agriculture outcomes fund granted thr ough our p ositive agricultur e outcome s fund 1 8

sourcing refers to meeting the independently verified environmental social and economic principles of pepsi co s sustainable farming program for supplier sourced crops sustainable sourcing is achieved through a third party standard that has been benchmarked as equivalent to the sfp or in limited regions a continuous improvement program addressing the main environmental and social risks with growing the relevant crop percentage of volume sustainably sourced and verified by third parties including volume of certified sustainable palm oil meeting roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo standard and volume of certified sustainable cane sugar meeting bonsucro or equivalent standard 2 cane sugar results reflect the exclusion of soda stream and pioneer foods approach we re already using sustainably sourced ingredients in many of the pepsi co products consumers know and love we ve established sustainable sourcing standards as a baseline expectation for our agricultural suppliers and we re supporting farmers in making the transition to more sustainable approaches these efforts aim to ensure a secure supply of key ingredients while helping improve the livelihoods of farmers in our supply chain around 50 of the volume of our key ingredients are bought directly from farmers through a grower group grower sourced while there are multiple tiers between the farmer and pepsi co for the other approximately 50 supplier sourced toward our 2030 goal of reaching 100 of sustainably sourced key ingredients in 2021 we achieved more than 90 on grower sourced crops as we continue to engage our main suppliers globally to achieve our goals we engage suppliers through two approaches high risk approach requires high risk commodities palm cane and soy and commodities grown in high risk markets to be verified certified to a sustainability standard recognized by pepsi co low and medium risk approach consists of working with suppliers to adopt a continuous improvement model requiring them to demonstrate active work and progress toward outcomes by 2030 these efforts seek to ensure a secure supply of key ingredients while helping improve the livelihoods of farmers in our supply chain sustainably source 100 of our key ingredients expanding to include not only our grower sourced crops potatoes whole corn and oats but also key crops from third parties such as vegetable oils and grains1 2 2021 50 0 2030 goal 100 positive agriculture8 2021 pepsi co esg summary we supported farmers in making the transition to more sustainable approaches positive ag supplier playbook in 2022 we launched a positive ag supplier playbook at our supplier summit a public resource for buyers and suppliers to activate the goal across our entire key ingredient footprint mexico in 2021 in mexico pepsi co partnered with a supplier to pilot the bonsucro smallholder standard which resulted in 25 smallholder producers becoming certified among the first in the country southeast mexico in 2021 in southeast mexico we launched agrovita a collaborative effort to strengthen the technical capabilities of 1 000 smallholders to implement regenerative agriculture increase women empowerment and reduce smallholder carbon footprint southeast asia in 2021 in collaboration with leading palm oil players we launched the rimba collective the largest private sector enabled forest conservation initiative in southeast asia for palm oil to deliver 1 billion for forest conservation and restoration positive agriculture9 2021 pepsi co esg summary improving livelihoods goal approach people are the foundation of the world s food system and our business to ensure the long term health of both it s essential for agricultural workers to earn a wage that enables them and their families to grow and thrive yet that s not always the reality in many parts of the world we support the advancement of farming practices to optimize crop yields respect human rights and plan to improve the livelihoods of more than 250 000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities by 2030 this includes economically empowering women we ve focused our efforts on our most vulnerable farming communities including smallholder farmers and farm workers women and minority farmers women farmers make up about 40 of the agricultural workforce in developing countries but are often denied key resources that could help them prosper these resources include among others access to land livestock education financial services agricultural advisory services technology and rural employment if women had equivalent resources it is estimated they could increase their yields by 20 30 and increase the agricultural output of their countries by up to 4 potentially reducing the number of hungry people in the world by 100

agricultural supply chains and communities the indicators are designed to be relevant across different crops scale of operations and geographies pepsi co and the pepsi co foundation promote greater diversity and inclusion in farm management including support for female farmers and people of color through partnerships with organizations like the u s agency for international development usaid inter american development bank iadb care and the national black growers council in 2021 we continued working with usaid on a 5 year 20 million partnership to support women owned and women led enterprises among pepsi co suppliers in rural farming communities in asia the middle east and latin america the programs will improve resiliency in these communities and show that inclusivity leads to better business results we launched the next generation agriculture fund with the iadb a partnership in which we aim to test and demonstrate the impact of gender smart solutions along our agricultural supply chains in dominican republic ecuador and guatemala this three year 2 million partnership between pepsi co lat am corporate affairs the global sustainability office s agriculture team and the iadb includes an innovative talent acquisition and development program as well as field activities that pilot the use of inclusive and gender smart solutions that enhance farmers resilience and contribute to pepsi co s positive agriculture goals our promotion of regenerative agriculture techniques and support for open source agricultural technology and information also helps improve farmer livelihoods regenerative practices can help farmers increase yield leading to higher margins and greater profitability our support programs such as cost sharing for cover crops and peer to peer learning at our demonstration farms help farmers ease the transition support for open source agricultural technology and information can have a similar impact we worked with corteva agriscience to sequence an entire oat genome and made it publicly available to enable the creation of more resilient productive and profitable varieties in addition we became a founding partner of ag mission an unprecedented initiative to reduce ghg emissions in agriculture with a 5 million commitment to expand our efforts toward creating a more sustainable planet across the board we see bilateral multilateral and pre competitive partnerships as critical to the ongoing success of pep the achievement of our 2025 and 2030 goals and the overall resilience and sustainability of our key supply chains they are instrumental in leveraging and mobilizing a wide range of technical and financial resources that support farmers as they make the transition to more regenerative and inclusive
