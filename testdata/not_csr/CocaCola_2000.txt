report ''unit case'' means a unit of 
measurement 
equal to 192 
U.S.  fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and ''unit case volume'' of the Company means the sum of (i) the number of unit cases sold by the Coca-Cola syrups

in equivalent 
unit cases) sold by The Minute Maid Company.
