Dear Shareholders: With profitable growth across all divisions,  on every continent and across both convenient food and beverage categoriesPepsiCo delivered a very strong 2005.  The company is continued focus on health and wellness,  and innovation — coupled with its efforts to build big,  muscular brands and powerful go-to-market systems — generated industry leading results.   Volume grew 7%.   Net revenue grew 11%.   Division operating profit grew 10%.   Earnings per share grew 15%. *  Total return to shareholders was 15% compared with 5% for the S&P.   Cash flow from operations was $59 billion and management operating cash flow was $42 billion. ** Steve Reinemund Chairman and Chief Executive Officer What is particularly pleasing about these results is the balance they represent.  Whether it is between foods and beverages,  North American and International operations,  or even different parts of the day,  our portfolio of leading brands finds convenient ways into consumers' lives any time of day,  anywhere across the globe.  That is why this year is report focuses on what your company is doing to capture growth opportunities on any given day across the world.  It is a departure from previous annual reports which focused primarily on each division is operating performance.  While you can still find division summaries in this report,  we want to give you a more holistic view of how your company is seeking to capture growth opportunities.  You'll see these opportunities addressed in the key themes in the pages that follow,  but we also recognize that there are specific questions to which many investors seek answers.  Over the last year,  we have

collected key questions shareholders most often ask about our businesses; they reflect issues we spend significant time and energy addressing.  And first,  on just about everyone is list,  is what PepsiCo is doing in the area of health and wellness.  
There is a lot in the press about the 'obesity epidemic. " How urgent is the obesity issue,  and does it pose a risk to PepsiCo is business? There is no question that obesity is a significant issue gaining increased attention and importance in many nations.  Public health is a complex issue that requires partnerships across public and private sectors to find solutions that help consumers.  That is why,  while we view this issue as a challenge,  we also see the growing interest in health and wellness as a growth opportunity.  Given that North America revenues from our Smart Spot eligible products — more than 250 products that contribute to healthier lifestyles — grew at more than two-and-one-half times the rate of the rest of our portfolio in 2005,  it is clear that our strategy is aligned with the interests of our consumers and retail partners.  And it is the right thing to do for our business.  As a result,  our commitment to health and wellness has never been stronger.  We believe the solution to consumers' health and wellness needs — and the obesity epidemic in particular — lies in the concept of energy balance; that is,  finding balance between the calories consumed and the calories burned.  It requires companies like PepsiCo to be part of the solution — a priority on which we will continue to take action.  Whether it is reformulating our products with lower sugar,  fat or sodium,  adding new or additional ingredients that deliver health benefits,  or developing entirely new products,  we have committed considerable resources to doing what we do best — giving consumers what they want.  We have also committed to supporting active lifestyles and marketing responsibly,  and I'd encourage you to read details surrounding all our work in health and wellness later in this report.  
Your commitment to the International business seems to be paying off.  What are the drivers of growth in your International business,  and do you expect the growth to continue at the same pace? The outstanding growth achieved by our International business in 2005 is the result of years of investment and the implementation of a deliberate strategy to create scale in key international markets that will deliver profitable growth.  As the fastest growing division at PepsiCo — and now the largest revenue generator — PepsiCo International is strategy clearly is delivering results.  To give more perspective on why we are encouraged about our international growth prospects,  the portfolio of international markets is both broadening and strengthening,  as we deliver exciting new products,  tailored to local tastes,  to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.  We are particularly pleased with our growing presence in key emerging markets such as Brazil,  China,  India and Russia.  We are very proud of the growth generated through our brands.  Our performance is directly attributable to the passionate people who run our businesses in our international markets,  each and every day of the year,  adapting our products,  packaging and distribution systems to a wide variety of tastes and market conditions.  We continue to expect our International business to grow at about twice the rate of our North American businesses,  though favorable global macroeconomics clearly contributed to our 2005 performance which exceeded that expectation.  
What is the role of acquisitions in PepsiCo is future growth? We continue to believe that small,  strategic,  or 'tuck in" acquisitions,  will help propel our future growth.  Our recent acquisitions of Sakata in Australia,  Star Foods in Poland,  Punica in GermanyP. J.  Smoothies in the United Kingdom and Stacy is Pita Chips in the United States,  are clear examples of how smaller acquisitions that offer considerable 
Management Operating Cash Flow ** $ in Millions 
synergies with our existing businesses can help us grow in new geographies and new categories.  In each case,  we exercise a disciplined approach to assessing any opportunity,  carefully reviewing both strategic and financial criteria to ensure a fit with PepsiCo.  It is important to understand that while acquisitions have a role to play in our growth plans,  we believe we'll continue to experience strong 'organic" growth in our existing portfolio of businesses.  They are equipped with big,  muscular brands,  they have room to grow,  and they receive constant investment and attention.  
The carbonated soft drink category in North America has slowed in recent years.  What does this trend mean for PepsiCo is growth prospects? While our carbonated soft drink business was down in North America in 2005,  we are convinced thatover time,  growth can be restored as we continue to invest in innovation for our carbonated beverages.  Our diet carbonated soft drinks continue to grow in North America,  an indication that consumers will remain engaged with the category if we offer carbonated soft drinks they desire.  Importantly,  if you look at the total liquid refreshment beverage (LRB) category in North America — meaning all beverage occasions except for coffeealcohol,  tap and bulk water — you'll see it is growing at about 25% annually.  This is consistent with historical growth rates for LRB,  and PepsiCo is very well positioned to capture this growth.  That is because we have an advantaged portfolio of non-carbonated beverages,  which is exactly where the growth in LRB is,  and where we believe it continues to head.  PepsiCo is line-up of waterssports drinks,  teas and energy drinks includes leading brands,  and they illustrate how an advantaged portfolio of non-carbonated beverages can deliver great products for consumers,  and solid returns for retailers and shareholders.

How are you preparing to grow PepsiCo is top line? In a word,  innovation — the lifeblood of any consumer products company.  PepsiCo views this capability as a critical and sustainable competitive advantage.  It is the reason we spend considerable time and dollars filling our pipeline with an array of consumer propositions to address needs for convenient foods and beverages.  We use a thoughtful and balanced approach to funding innovation and putting resources in place to support it.  Some examples of that balance include balancing good-for-you and better-for-you product innovation with resources earmarked for our fun-for-you portfolio.  In 2005,  for example,  our investment in new Aquafina FlavorSplash and new Gatorade Lemonade drove growth with our Smart Spot portfolio,  while Lay is Cheddar and Sour Cream

Potato Chips 
Tortilla Chips 
Corn Chip s 
flavored potato chips contributed to solid growth with our Lay is brand.  But it also means balancing investment between carbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  and balancing between 'close-in" ideas like line extensions,  and entirely new product platforms that don't exist today.  We have implemented new ways of coordinating the collection of insights from consumers and retail partners so we can better share those insights across our businesses,  and generate ideas that have a greater chance of success in the marketplace.  I think it is important to understand that innovation isn't limited to products.  Across PepsiCo,  we are constantly innovating to strengthen our go-to-market systems and to find structures that drive faster,  more efficient and more costeffective decision making.  A current example is our Business Process Transformation,  or BPT,  a comprehensive,  multi-year initiative that centers on moving all of PepsiCo to a common set of processes for key business activities,  with current efforts focused on North America.  
More than a year ago,  you announced PepsiCo is Business Process Transformation (BPT) initiative.  What are the objectives of this program,  and what is its status? Through larger acquisitions and mergers over the years,  such as Tropicana and Quaker,  we have recognized the need to seamlessly integrate formerly independent information systems.  We are also committed to harmonizing key business processes such as Finance,  Consumer Insights,  Purchasing and Supply Chain and continuously improving our customer service.  We are supporting these processes with common Information Technology applications,  linking our systems so that key pieces of data supporting all our businesses flow seamlessly from system to system.  2005 was a big year of preparation for the first deployment of our new,  integrated systemwhich started its phased roll out in early 2006.  In fact,  on January 16,  the very first of these new capabilities began its roll out.  Several of our North American plants,  along with our Global Procurement team,  now have streamlined tools and processes used for purchasing materials other than commodities,  packaging and ingredients.  Additional capabilities will be rolled out over the next several years.  When complete,  we expect to have an infrastructure that will support better,  faster decisionsallowing us to capture more growth opportunitiesand better serve our customers.  Importantly,  it will also leverage PepsiCo is scale for efficiency and effectiveness.  
On the cost side,  a number of key commodities have seen high rates of inflation.  How is PepsiCo managing in an environment of increasing costs? There is no doubt that 2005 was a challenging year for input costs — especially energy and plastics resin.  Between several major hurricanes hitting the United States and inflation,  we saw some expected and some unexpected pressure on our margins,  but we managed those cost pressures and met our financial targets.  And we expect 2006 to be challenging as welllargely reflecting increased energy and commodity costs.  However,  we have solid plans in place to offset these rising costs through productivity programs and hedging strategies,  and expect to carefully manage pricing to help offset some of the inflation.  
PepsiCo is businesses generate a great deal of cash,  and the Company is balance sheet is very conservative.  Why don't you put more debt on the balance sheet and use the proceeds to increase the dividend or increase share repurchases? PepsiCo does generate considerable cash,  and we are disciplined about how cash is reinvested in the business.  Over the past three years,  $57 billion has been reinvested in the businesses through capital expenditures and acquisitions,  and $120 billion has been returned to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  In essence,  any cash we have not reinvested in the business has been returned to our shareholders.  And,  we are pleased with our current capital structure and debt ratings,  which give us ready access to capital markets and keep our cost of borrowing down.  
PepsiCo is focus on people — specifically diversity and inclusion — has been a priority in previous reports.  What results have you delivered through this focus and what changes have you made? In terms of the diversity of our workforce,  we have seen a significant increase in the number of women and people of color who have joined PepsiCo in various functions and at various levels.  Since 2000the percentage of women in management positions in the United States has risen from 20% to 25%.  The number of people of color in management positions has climbed from 15% to almost 22% — we made a gain of about 2 points of growth in 2005 alone.  This change in the workforce has contributed to our growth through product ideasgreater insights about consumers and connections into growing urban and ethnic communities.  While a diverse workforce is important,  we must also create an inclusive environment where everyone — regardless of race,  gender,  physical ability or sexual orientation — feels valued,  engaged,  and wants to be part of our growth.  It is only through 
inclusion that we will fully unleash innovation and growth for our business.  To capture this potential,  we made some changes in 2005.  For example,  to put accountability for diversity and inclusion squarely in the hands of our people,  and into our divisions,  we formed the PepsiCo Diversity & Inclusion Governance Council.  Representatives from each division and various functions comprise the council,  and its chair reports directly to me.  I also asked each of my direct reports to take ownership for the development of specific employee groups.  Whether it is African AmericansLatinos,  white males,  women,  or other groups of PepsiCo employees,  each has a voice at the most senior decision-making entity at your company.  
In the context of people issues,  corporate responsibility is a hot topic.  How are you ensuring PepsiCo associates are acting in accordance with the law,  and — beyond the law — doing the right thing? 
As we have with previous reports,  we have included a section on corporate social responsibility to highlight what we have accomplished in 2005,  and I invite you to visit our website as well to read our report in detail.  More importantly,  I hope the contents of this annual report — along with even more details that are published on our website — will help you understand that your company is addressing the challenges ahead with the strength of muscular brands,  a growing and powerful go-to-market system,  a commitment to innovation,  and passionatediverse people committed to growing the business in responsible ways.  This is the PepsiCo that is poised to deliver on our commitment to responsible growth at any timeand on any day.

Growth is our reason for being.  In fact,  growth is so much a part of PepsiCo is DNA that it is reflected in our valu es as our commitment to sustaine d growth.  Fundamentally,  there are two way s for a corporation to generate prof itable growth for its shareholders: by incr easing revenues and decreasing cost s.  It is a relatively simple concept,  but the longer a company is in business and the bigger it gets,  the more difficult growth is to achieve.  And in acco mplishing these most basic — and difficult — priorities over time,  the single biggest contributor to sustained growth lies in how the enterprise consistently delivers top-line growth and bottom-line perf ormance.  Over time,  the way a com pany delivers growth will define the diffe rence between its success and failu re.  
PepsiCo Values venient PepsiCo is the leading con y in the pan com ge food and bevera United States.  
'Sustained Growth" means consisten t growth for our business as well as our people — growth year after year.  'Empowered People" is the second piece of that commitment,  as the decisions that drive the business come from tens of thousands of PepsiCo asso ciates throughout the world who developmanufacture and deliver our prod ucts.  Empowered people act and think in ways that get the job done,  and innovate to find new ways to achieve growth.  'Responsibility and Trust" is the third piece of our commitment.  It articulates that acting responsibly and earning the trust of our shareholders,  cust omersconsumers and other stakeholders is a necessity for growth.  Our grow th must come the right way.  It takes a lifet ime to build that trust,  and a sing le misstep can destroy it.  Winning is only wort h it if is done the right way — acti ng in a responsible way that will build trus t.  
Top Line: Our Competitive Advant ages 
Growing revenues,  or the top line ,  requires constant care and inve stment in our competitive advantages.  These are the strengths we bring to the mar ketplace that set us apart.  These include our qua lity brands — products known and trusted by consumers around the world.  We constantly revitalize these brands with packaging and product improvements and consumer promotions to keep them stro ng.  When an opportunity to add new products that complement our port folio comes along,  we consider building them from within or acquiring new brands through smaller 'tuck in" acquisiti ons,  which can be integrated easi ly with our lines of business.  Our ability to innovate is another competitive advantage.  We look for opportunities to capitalize on the value of our brands by creating new products and varieties.  By innovating to mee t consumer needs and preferenceswe fill 
consumption gaps and contribute to creating both healthier and indu lgent choices for consumers,  and bringing more enjoyment to their lives.  Bringing those products to consume rs is where our third major competi tive strength comes into play: our stro ng,  established delivery systems.  The y incl ude direct-store-delivery,  where our own associates load and set up the shel ves; warehouse systems,  where retailers store and replenish product; and dedicated teams to supply foodservice and vending customers.  The strength and span of our systems help us quickly intro duce a product into the market — whic h helps us put our products within easy reac h whenever a consumer is thirsty or hungry.  
Bottom Line: A Constant Focus 
Through our Business Process Tran sformation initiative,  we are equally focused on reducing expenses to produce a healthy bottom line.  We are stre aml inin g our processes by employing new tech nology to meet customer and busi ness need s.  We are finding new ways to capture the full value of every penny we earn ,  such as using a new treasury management program to invest revenues the sam e day we receive them.

PepsiCo now has 17 powerful brands known around the world that each generate annual retail sales of more than $1 billion.  
Early in the year,  Pepsi-Cola North America capitalized on our leading Aquafina brand with FlavorSplash,  a zero-calorie water made with natural fruit flavors and sweetened with Splenda no-calorie sweetener.  Our SoBe team built on the strength of its South Beach Diet program-endorsed Lean line with two new flavors: Lean Energy and Lean Mango Melon.  The Pepsi-Lipton Tea Partnership unveiled a new Diet Sweet version of ready-to-drink Lipton Iced Tea.  We also kept our carbonated soft drink brands top of mind.  Building sales of our flagship Pepsi brand,  Pepsi-Cola introduced Pepsi Lime and Diet Pepsi Lime,  a pair of colas featuring the popular lime flavor.  Pioneering a new category of 'energy sodas, " Pepsi-Cola launched MDX,  a beverage touting the familiar citrus flavor of Mountain Dew,  but fueled by a 'power pack" of ingredients including ginsengguarana,  taurine and D-ribose.  The march of our new products continued when Tropicana introduced Tropicana Pure Premium Essentials with Fiber — the first national orange juice with added fiber.  It delivers as much fiber as a whole orange in every 8-ounce glass.  Then we gave lemonade a new meaning with the introduction of a Gatorade Lemonade,  a line that combines the refreshing taste of lemonade with the scientifically supported formula of Gatorade Thirst Quencher.  At Frito-Lay North America,  we reformulated all our Quaker Chewy granola bars to remove trans fat — plus we reformulated many of them to reduce sugar by 25% and add calcium.  Many of these bars now bear the Smart Spot symbol and our new package graphics reinforce the linkage to Quaker Oatmeal.  In our Oberto meat snacks line,  distributed by Frito-Lay,  we introduced Oh Boy! Oberto Beef Jerky Crisps,  a firstof-its-kind snack that bridges the gap between beef jerky and traditional snack chips.  At our Quaker Foods business,  we added to our successful Life Cereal line with the introduction of Life Vanilla Yogurt Crunch — combining Life Cereal with yogurt-coated clusters while delivering nine essential vitamins and minerals and providing a good source of calcium and fiber.  Quaker also introduced new Weight Control instant oatmeal,  a quick,  convenient way to eat a nutritious breakfast that is high in fiber and a good source of protein,  and Quaker Oatmeal-To-Go bars,  which provide all the nutrition of a bowl of instant oatmeal.

Hundreds of innovations help drive our growth in international markets.  Pepsi Cino,  the first cola-coffee flavor combination from a major beverage company,  was a dynamic new entry to the carbonated soft drink arena.  7UP H2O,  a sugar-free sparkling water infused with the flavor of 7UP,  was launched in Argentina and proved highly appealing to consumers interested in lighter beverages.  In China,  the relaunch and expansion of Gatorade helped us capture a solid position in the growing sports drink category.  And we expanded Tropicana in EuropeAsia and the Middle East.  
Capturing Consumer Attention with Packaging Packaging captures attention and gives us an opportunity to tell consumers about our brands.  For example,  Lipton Original received a makeover.  It is now in 16-ounce glass bottles that include a logo noting the brand is naturally protective antioxidants.  We introduced new striking black and silver graphics to highlight reformulated Pepsi ONE.  SoBe Beverages celebrated its tenth anniversary by unveiling new graphics for the entire 20-ounce product line,  scheduled to be on the shelves in 2006.  The Tropicana Light  n Healthy packaging was the first juice beverages to carry Weight Watchers' proprietary POINTS values on the packaging.  Outside the United States,  one highlight of our packaging innovation was a new 7UP plastic bottle with a distinctive,  proprietary shape that features bold graphics and is attracting lots of attention on store shelves.  
Promotions that Keep Our Brands Top of Mind Pepsi-Cola used music to help keep our brands top of mind.  The Pepsi iTunes giveaway offered 200 million free songs.  In mid-year,  Pepsi and Yahoo! announced a partnership to bring music to fans with 'Smash on Yahoo! Music, " an adaptation of the 'Pepsi Smash" summer concert TV program.  With 'Call Upon Yoda, " an instant-win sweepstakes,  Pepsi-Cola took advantage of the release of the highly anticipated movie 'Star Wars: Episode III,  Revenge of the Sith. " Frito-Lay joined by launching Star Wars-inspired Twisted Cheetos snacks,  which temporarily turned the color of consumers' tongues into 'Yoda Green" or 'Darth Vader Dark. " Pepsi was back with our 'Go Pro" sweepstakes,  a sports fan is fantasy that offered the chance to win trips to select professional sporting events across the country.  Then Pepsi turned up the volume even higher with its highly successful Mountain Dew promotion that gave away an Xbox 360 next-generation video game and entertainment system every ten minutes.  Mountain Dew made news with Mountain Dew (MD) Films and Universal Pictures joint release of 'First Descent, " the story of the rise of snowboarding.  Our SoBe business kept the action going all year with concert tours,  support of major surfing eventssupercross/motocross racing and skateboarding — activities that reflect active lives of 'Team Lizard" fans.  Gatorade gave its brands local visibility through the Gatorade Athlete of the Year award program which recognizes young athletes.

PepsiCo beverages are dist ributed by a powerful go-to-market sys tem which includes company-owned ope rati independently-owned franchis onsed bottlers and warehouse delivery sys tems.  
Our goal is to have our products in arm is reach whenever and wherever consumers want them.  And we are delivering — literally.  For example,  our brands include seven of the 13 largest food and beverage brands sold in U.S.  supermarkets.  Whether they are new or brandloyal consumers,  each consumer must be able to find our products in order to buy them.  That is why the strength of our selling,  distribution and internal systems is so critical.  From stocking shelves and creating displays in supermarkets,  to making sure the small corner deli has our products,  our front-line teams go the distance.  They are supported by an infrastructure dedicated to streamlining our processes and enhancing our growth through efficiency.  For example,  we are consolidating global purchasing to ensure we leverage our spending,  and we are revamping our business processes to give our customers what they need.  
Our Distribution Systems Most of our sales are delivered through direct-store-delivery (DSD) distribution systemswhere a dedicated team delivers the product to the stores and places our products on the shelves.  This gives us the opportunity to merchandise our products and make sure they are always available.  It gives the route salesperson the ability to meet the specific needs of any retailer.  Our system reached hundreds of thousands of retail outlets this way,  from tiny convenience stores to the largest supermarkets,  helping us distribute new product offerings in record time.  In 2005,  we started to add 475 new distribution routes at Frito-Lay in the United States — our largest addition in nearly a decade.  Internationallyour sales force of almost 35000 reaches nearly every corner of the globe.  Our Gatorade and shelf-stable Tropicana juices,  as well as many of our Quaker and other less perishable products,  are delivered through one of the largest warehouse delivery systems in the world.  Tropicana Pure Premium comes fresh through a refrigerated warehouse or chilled direct-store-delivery system.  Our distribution systems are designed to meet the needs of our customers.  For example,  Frito-Lay sells its Gamesa cookies and crackers through warehouse,  third-party distributors,  direct shipment and DSD.  When taken together,  over the past three yearsPepsiCo products delivered through all these methods contributed more to the growth in U.S.  supermarkets than any other company.  An equally robust system is dedicated to delivering our products to foodservice and vending customers.  New beverage partners include Taco John is and Arby is — high-traffic restaurants.  Taco John is operates and franchises more than 400 quick-serve restaurants in 27 states.  Arby is consists of nearly 3500 restaurants worldwide,  including more than 1000 in the United States.  Pepsi-Cola expanded its partnership with Metromedia Restaurant Group (MRG),  which has more than 800 restaurants.  The new partnership adds Bennigan is and Steak & Ale restaurants to the existing relationship with Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses.

Business Process Transformation/Project One Up Execution begins long before our products are delivered.  PepsiCo is Business Process Transformation (BPT) initiative is addressing the changing market and needs of our customers.  In the past,  PepsiCo divisions operated on separate information systems and had varying business processes.  In 2004,  we embarked on a journey to change our business model to better meet the needs of our retail customers.  The most central piece of our BPT efforts is an implementation called Project One Up,  so named because it will allow us to 'one up" the competition.  It is a multi-year project to simplify and synchronize our business processes and tools into one common platform.  We believe Project One Up will help PepsiCo in key areas:  Customer insights — We will collect more and better consumer behavior and marketing insights to increase sales.   Procurement — We will consolidate and optimize purchasing to reduce costs and ensure supply.   Supply chain — We will manufacture and distribute our products faster and more efficiently,  based on the increased information and new processes.   Finance — We will consolidate billing and provide more complete and responsive financial data to our trading partners.   Go-to-market — We will share information throughout PepsiCo faster and with more efficiency,  improving customer service.  We have a dedicated team of representatives from various divisions and functions working on Project One Up.

Making Every Penny Count Innovation can improve our processes.  When our treasury team required a banking system with global visibility to optimize PepsiCo is investments,  they teamed with Citigroup to develop a web-based tool called 'TreasuryVision" that provides views of real-time balances,  cash positions,  investments and borrowings worldwide.  Every day,  in countries around the world,  our sales force receives payments from stores for products and deposits those funds across hundreds of bank accounts.  In the past,  there may have been a lag of up to several days before our treasury team had access to these funds.  The new system will provide visibility to these funds and will enable us to invest them more efficiently.

PepsiCo has always been a responsi ble corporation.  Our Worldwide Cod e of Conduct had guided our actions for decadesand we have been a consistent cont ributor to our communities and to the nonprofit organizations that support our soci ety.  We have been recognized as a leading company in areas such as diversity and inclu sion,  purchasing from women-owned and minority-own ed suppliers,  corporate governanceenvironmental stewardship and social leadership.  We provide our associates with a broad menu of benefits and competitive compen sation.  We recognize our responsi bility to consumers to provide safe,  quality products,  and to offer product choices that help them meet their needs,  whether it is a need for pure refreshment and fun,  or for foods and beverages that make it easier and more enjo yable for them to lead healthier livesWe recognize that is not enough.  
Our Sustainability Journey 
In 2003,  we took the first steps on a journey to become a more sust ainable corporation.  We voluntarily adopted the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines as a template for reporting on our econ omic,  environmental and social perf ormance — the 'triple bottom line" — and a mea sure of our sustainability.  In 200 4,  we took another important step with the establish ment of our Sustainability Task Forc e,  comprised of senior executives from all our divis ions.  Throughout 2004 and 2005,  the Sustainability Task Force defined our sustainability vision and we determined our key focus areas: values,  diversity and inclusion,  health and wellness,  and the environmentespecially water and packaging.  We placed emphasis on the development of environm ental standards and metrics.  The Sustainability Task Force,  work ing with PepsiCo is Environmental Task Forcedeveloped consistent metrics for tracking our progress in the areas of water and energy.  These measures are being introduc ed into all our divisions.  A sound Environmental Managem ent System (EMS) is basic to sust ainability.  In 2005,  PepsiCo developed a fram ework that establishes rigorous proc edures for managing our environmental impacts.  Prev iously,  each division had distinct envi ronmental programs and processes.  We have targeted 2006 to begin the process of implementing our new EMS framework across our businesses.  Further progress was made on our Capital Expenditure Filter,  a proc ess that ensures that sustainability issues are form ally considered in all major capital expenditure proposals.  We piloted the filter on two projects,  a new Gatorade plan t in Virginia and a new warehouse in Arizona.  The filte r proved to be a valuable tool in decision-making Contribution Summary PepsiCo Foundation Corporate Contributions Divisions Estimated In-Kind Donations Total 
The PepsiCo Foundation and PepsiCo committed $20 million in disaster relief related to the tsunami in Southeast Asia.

We are seeking opportunities to imp lement our minimization and opti mization philosophyboth reducing our impacts and seek ing ways to reach optimal solution s.  For example,  Gatorade is installing state-of-the-art high spee d lines that minimize product spill age.  The lines use advanced air rinsing of empty Gato rade bottles.  
Values Each year,  every PepsiCo associat e is asked to review our Worldwide Code of Conduct and recommit to living by it.  Associates rece ive training in the Code,  which is available in 38 languages and is accessible from both our internal and external websites.  In 2005we took additional steps to ensure that key associates underst and every aspect of our Code.  We developed online and written training and certification that app roximately 25000 executives and associates are required to complete.  We report the results of these programs to our Board of Dire ctors.  During the year,  we improved our Speak Up line — a free hotline oper ated by a third party — which PepsiCo associates may call to report any issue of concern,  incl uding those relating to values,  Code of Conduct and acco unting and auditing issues.  The line is accessible from anywhere around the world and calle rs may remain anonymous.  
Diversity and Inclusion We are becoming a much more dive rse and global company.  Actively working to create a more diverse workforce and supplier base helps us better understand custome rs and consumers.  A focus on developing an inclusive atmosphere where all associates feel they can succeed helps PepsiCo succeed.  Each of our employee networks is represented at the most senior leve ls by an executive reporting to our chief executive offic er.  Our U.S.  groups include Afric an-Americans,  LatinosAsian,  Women,  White Males,  Gay /Bisexual/Lesbian/Transgender (GB LT) and our newest group'Enable, " for individuals with diffe rent abilities.  We launched an electronic employe e newsletter dedicated to diversity and inclusion.

The franchise bottlers sell our brands as finished goods to independent distributors and retailers.  PBNA is volume reflects sales to its independent distributors and retailers,  and the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that franchise bottlers have reported as sold to independent distributors and retailers.  
Operating Profit Contribution to Growth 
PepsiCo International PepsiCo International (PI) manufactures through consolidated businesses as well as through noncontrolled affiliates,  a number of leading salty and sweet snack brands including Gamesa and Sabritas in MexicoWalkers in the United Kingdom,  and Smith is in Australia.  Further,  PI manufactures or uses contract manufacturersmarkets and sells many Quaker brand snacks.  PI also manufactures,  markets and sells beverage concentrates,  fountain syrups and finished goods under the brands Pepsi,  7UP,  Mirinda,  GatoradeMountain Dew and Tropicana.  These 
brands are sold to franchise bottlersindependent distributors and retailers.  However,  in certain markets,  PI operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities.  PI also licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its franchise bottlers.  PI reports two measures of volume.  Snack volume is reported on a system-wide basis,  which includes our own volume and the volume sold by our noncontrolled affiliates.  Beverage volume reflects company-owned and franchise bottler sales of beverages bearing our trademarks to independent distributors and retailers.  
Quaker Foods North America Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) manufactures or uses contract manufacturersmarkets and sells cereals,  rice,  pasta and other branded products.  QFNA is products include Quaker oatmeal,  Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups,  Quaker grits,  Cap n Crunch and Life ready-to-eat cerealsRice-A-Roni,  Pasta Roni and Near East side dishes.  These branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers.  
Our Customers Our customers include franchise bottlers and independent distributors and retailers.  We normally grant our bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area.  These arrangements specify the amount to be paid by our bottlers for concentrate and full goods and for Aquafina royalties,  as well as the manufacturing process required for product quality.  Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  For our independent distributors and retailers,  these incentives include volume-based rebates,  product placement fees,  promotions and displays.  For our bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentives,  advertising support,  new product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include coupons,  pricing discounts and promotions,  such as sweepstakes and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting bottler media.  New product 
support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-of-purchase materials,  product placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  The level of bottler funding is at our discretion because these incentives are not required by the terms of our bottling contracts.  Retail consolidation has increased the importance of major customers and further consolidation is expected.  Sales to WalMart Stores,  Inc.  represent approximately 9% of our total worldwide net revenue; and our top five retail customers currently represent approximately 26% of our 2005 North American net revenue,  with Wal-Mart representing approximately 11%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  In addition,  sales to The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) represent approximately 10% of our total net revenue.  See 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 for more information on our anchor bottlers.  
Our customers include franchise bottlers and independent distributors and retailers.  Our Related Party Bottlers We have ownership interests in certain of our bottlers.  Our ownership is less than 50% and since we do not control these bottlers,  we do not consolidate their results.  We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of economic ownership in our income statement as bottling equity income.  We have designated three related party bottlersPBG,  PepsiAmericas,  Inc.  (PAS) and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (PBV),  as our anchor bottlers.  Our anchor bottlers distribute approximately 62% of our North American beverage volume and approximately 19% of our international beverage volume.  Our anchor bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above.  Approximately 8% of our total 2005 sales incentives are related to these bottlers.  See Note 8 for additional information on these related parties and related party commitments and guarantees.  
Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery,  broker-warehouse and foodservice and vending distribution networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needs,  product characteristics and local trade practices.  Direct-Store-Delivery We and our bottlers operate direct-storedelivery systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.  Direct-store-delivery enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  Direct-store-delivery is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  
Broker-Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,  have lower turnover,  and are less likely to be impulse purchases.  
Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks,  foods and beverages to third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators,  and for certain beverages,  distributes through our bottlers.  This distribution system supplies our products to schools,  businesses,  stadiumsrestaurants and similar locations.  
Direct-store-delivery enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  
Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against globalregional,  local and private label manufacturers on the basis of price,  qualityproduct variety and effective distribution.  In measured channels,  our chief beverage competitor,  The Coca-Cola Company,  has a slightly larger share of carbonated soft drink (CSD) consumption in the U.S, while we have a larger share of chilled 
juices and isotonics.  In addition,  The Coca-Cola Company maintains a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside North America.  Further,  our snack brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack industry worldwide.  Our snack brands face local and regional competitorsas well as national and global snack competitors,  and compete on issues related to price,  quality,  variety and distribution.  
Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products and the introduction of new products.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketingcoupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution networkallow us to compete effectively.  
tions.  Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our 
employees serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental compensation for their Board services.  
Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotia 28 
Our Business Risks We are subject to risks in the normal course of business due to adverse developments with respect to:  product demand our reputation information technology supply chain retail consolidation and the loss of major customers global economic and environmental conditions the regulatory environment workforce retention raw materials and energy competition,  and  market risks.  Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes.  We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profitswe must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Any significant changes in consumer preferences and our inability to anticipate and react to such 
Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends,  such as consumer health concerns about obesity,  product attributes and ingredients.  changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position.  Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends,  such as consumer health concerns about obesity,  product attributes and ingredients.  In addition,  changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a 
variety of factors,  including the aging of the general population,  changes in social trends,  changes in travel,  vacation or leisure activity patterns or a downturn in economic conditions,  which may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase premium branded products.  Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovation,  including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products,  and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  There can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products,  or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  
Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  If we fail to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  our reputation could be jeopardized.  Adverse publicity about these types of concernswhether or not valid,  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and 
delivery disruptions.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption,  misbranded or causes injury,  we may have to 
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time,  which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities could also jeopardize our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  
If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  our business could suffer.  We depend on information technology as an enabler to operating efficiently and interfacing with customers,  as well as maintaining financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate,  and effectively manage,  the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficienciesthe loss of customers,  business disruptionsor the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We have embarked on a multiyear Business Process Transformation (BPT) initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning applicationas well as the migration to common business processes across our North American operations.  There can be no certainty that 
these programs will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the application on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption.  
Our ability to make,  move and sell products is critical to our success.  As with all large systems,  our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting informationcorrupting information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.  
Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability to make,  move and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weathernatural disaster,  fire or explosion,  terrorismpandemic,  strikes or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occur,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  
Trade consolidation or the loss of any key customer could adversely affect our financial performance.  There is a greater concentration of our customer base around the world generally due to the continued consolidation of retail trade.  As retail ownership becomes more concentrated,  retailers demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  as larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and 
private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to these trends or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customersincluding our retailers and anchor bottlersto effectively compete.  Loss of any of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  See 'Our Customers, " 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers,  including our anchor bottlers.  
Our business may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic or environmental conditions or political or other developments and risks in the countries in which we operate.  Unfavorable global economic or environmental changes,  political conditions or other developments may result in business disruption,  supply constraints,  foreign currency devaluation,  inflation,  deflation or decreased demand.  Economic conditions in North America could also adversely impact growth.  For example,  rising fuel costs may impact the sales of our products in convenience stores where our products are generally sold in higher margin single serve packages.  Our international operations accounted for over a third of our evenue for the period ended December 312005.  Unstable economic and political conditions or civil unrest in the countries in which we operate could have adverse impacts on our business results or financial condition.  
Regulatory decisions and changes in the legal and regulatory environment could increase our costs and liabilities or limit our business activities.  The conduct of our businesses,  and the production,  distribution,  sale,  advertisinglabeling,  safety,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to 
foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  These laws and regulations may change,  sometimes dramatically,  as a result of political,  economic or social events.  Changes in laws,  regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment 
Changes in laws,  regulations or governmental policy may alter the environment in which we do business.  in which we do business and,  therefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  Such regulatory environment changes include changes in food and drug laws,  laws related to advertising and deceptive marketing practices,  accounting standards,  taxation requirementscompetition laws and environmental lawsincluding California Proposition 65 and the regulation of water consumption and treatment.  In particular,  governmental bodies in countries where we operate may impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may also have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctions,  which could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  See also 'Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance. " 
If we are unable to hire or retain key employees,  it could have a negative impact on our business.  Our continued growth requires us to develop our leadership bench and to implement programs,  such as our longterm incentive program,  designed to retain talent.  However,  there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees.  We compete to hire new employees,  and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Our 
operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employeeshigher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  
Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs or shortages of raw materials.  We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity pricesaffecting the cost of our raw materials and energy.  The raw materials and energy 
which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand,  weather conditionsagricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costs,  we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating income.  
Our business could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.  Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against globalregional and private label manufacturers on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and effective distribution.  Increased competition and anticipated actions by our competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in our market share,  either of which could adversely affect our results.  See 'Our Competition" for more information about our competitors.  
Market Risks We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange rates interest rates stock prices,  and  discount rates affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiativesglobal purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  Our hedging strategies involve the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we limit our 
exposure to individual counterparties to manage credit risk.  The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 for further 
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets 
and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to stock prices and discount rates.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  Commodity Prices Our open commodity derivative contracts had a face value of $89 million at December 31,  2005 and $155 million at December 25,  2004.  The open derivative contracts designated as accounting hedges resulted in net unrecognized gains of $39 million at December 31,  2005 and an unrecognized loss of $1 million at December 25,  2004.  We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have reduced our unrecognized gains on open contracts to $35 million in 2005 and increased our unrecognized losses to $9 million in 2004.  The open derivatives contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges resulted in net recognized losses of $3 million in 2005 and $2 million in 2004.  
We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have increased our recognized losses on open contracts to $4 million in 2005 and to $5 million in 2004.  In 2006,  we expect continued pricing pressures on our raw materials and energy costs.  We expect to be able to mitigate the impact of these increased costs through our hedging strategies and ongoing productivity initiatives.  Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate over a third of our net revenue of which Mexico,  the United Kingdom and Canada comprise nearly 20%.  As a resultwe are exposed to foreign currency risksincluding unforeseen economic changes and political unrest.  During 2005,  net favorable foreign currency,  primarily increases in the Mexican peso,  Brazilian real,  and Canadian dollar,  contributed over 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  
Currency declines which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in the income statement as incurred.  We may enter into derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $11 billion at December 31,  2005 and $908 million at December 25,  2004.  The contracts designated as accounting hedges resulted in net unrecognized losses of $9 million at December 31,  2005 and $27 million at December 25,  2004.  We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have resulted in unrecognized losses of $81 million in 2005 and $110 million in 2004.  The contracts not designated as accounting hedges resulted in net recognized gains of $14 million and less than $1 million at December 31,  2005 and December 25,  2004,  respectively.  These gains were almost entirely offset by changes in the underlying hedged itemsresulting in no net impact on earnings.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency 
interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our counterparty credit risk is considered low because these swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  Assuming year-end 2005 and 2004 variable rate debt and investment levelsa one point increase in interest rates would have decreased net interest expense by $8 million in 2005 and $11 million in 2004.  Stock Prices A portion of our deferred compensation liability is tied to certain market indices and our stock price.  We manage these market risks with mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts for the purchase of our stock.  The combined gains or losses on these investments are substantially offset by changes in our deferred compensation liability.  
Our Approach to Managing Risks The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives will necessarily involve taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we 
In 2005,  we continued our effort to drive risk mitigation focus to where risks can be most efficiently and effectively managed.  leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritizemanage,  monitor,  and communicate risks across the company.  This framework includes:  the PepsiCo Executive Risk Council (PERC),  comprised of a cross-functionalgeographically diverse,  senior management group which identifies,  assessesprioritizes and addresses primarily strategic and reputational risks;  Division Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet regularly each year to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address division-specific operating risks;  PepsiCo is Risk Management Officewhich manages the overall processprovides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PERC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties,  as well as to PepsiCo is Audit Committee; and  PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which confirms the ongoing effectiveness of the risk management framework through periodic audit and review procedures.  In 2005,  we continued our effort to drive risk mitigation focus to where risks can be most efficiently and effectively managed and reinforced ownership and accountability for risk management within the business.  Some highlights include: 
 With respect to product demand,  we continued to focus on the development of products that respond to consumer trends,  such as comsumer health concerns about obesity,  product attributes and ingredients,  including reformulating products to lower sugar,  fats,  and sodium; adding ingredients that deliver health benefits; and expanding our offering of portion-controlled packages.  Smart Spot eligible products continued to be the fastest growing part of our North American product portfolio.  We continued to focus on marketing our products in ways that promote healthier lifestyles.  We helped create and endorsed the American Beverage Association is new schools policy,  which defines the types of products that may be sold in schools.  We actively promoted healthy energy balance through our national sponsorship of America On the Move,  a program designed to help families take simple steps to maintain a healthy energy balance.   We enhanced the coordination of our Division-led product integrity efforts through the creation of the PepsiCo Product Integrity Council (PPIC),  a cross-functional forum to share leading practices and confer about areas of potential risk.  
Smart Spot eligible products continued to be the fastest growing part of our North American product portfolio.   We continued to enhance our internal IT infrastructure,  by consolidating and updating technology and retiring older technology,  as well as improving our information security capabilities.   We continued implementation of our BPT initiative,  which we believe will enable us to remain in step with the changing needs of our customers.  Overall BPT project governance is provided through steering committees headed by senior executives and a team is in place to drive effective risk man agement and quality processes and to build an internal control environment compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   We continue to assess our capability to mitigate potential business disruptions and evaluate an integrated approach to business disruption managementincluding disaster recovery,  crisis management,  and business continuity.   We established a compliance and ethics leadership structure,  appointing an SVPDeputy General Counsel who is focusing on business practices and complianceprioritizing projects to enhance the effectiveness of our compliance and 
We established a compliance and ethics leadership structure in 2005.  ethics program,  including developing a multilingual Code of Conduct training program that will be rolled out in 2006.   We have implemented human resource programs which focus on diversity and inclusion,  leadership development,  succession planning,  and employee work-life flexibility,  and are aimed at hiringdeveloping,  and retaining our talented and motivated workforce.  Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements We discuss expectations regarding our future performance,  such as our business outlook,  in our annual and quarterly reports,  press releases,  and other written and oral statements.  These 'forward-looking statements" are based on currently available competitive,  financial and economic data and our operating plans.  They are inherently uncertain,  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations.  We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  The above discussion of risks is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and future results.  
Our Critical Accounting Policies An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary Our critical accounting policies arise in to understand our financial results.  These policies may require conjunction with the following: management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding  revenue recognitionuncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly  brand and goodwill valuationsimpact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and  income tax expense and accrualsthe likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying  stock-based compensation expense,  and variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting  pension and retiree medical plans.  for stock-based compensation and pension plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve the choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  In connection with our ongoing BPT initiative,  we aligned certain accounting policies across our divisions in 2005.  We conformed our methodology for calculating our bad debt reserves and modified our policy for recognizing revenue for products shipped to customers by third-party carriers.  Additionally,  we conformed our method of accounting for certain costs,  primarily warehouse and freight.  These changes reduced our net revenue by $36 million and our operating profit by $60 million in 2005.  We also made certain reclassifications on our Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of 2005 from cost of sales to selling,  general and administrative expenses in connection with our BPT initiative.  These reclassifications resulted in reductions to cost of sales of $556 million through the third quarter of 2005,  $732 million in the full year 2004 and $688 million in the full year 2003,  with corresponding increases to selling,  general and administrative expenses in those periods.  These reclassifications had no net impact on operating profit and have been made to all periods presented for comparability.  There have been no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during 2005 that have had,  or are expected to have,  a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for warehouse distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our historical experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and 
out-of-date products.  Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for the products they distribute.  Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In addition,  DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  customer inventory levels are monitored.  As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of sales and totaled $89 billion in 2005,  $78 billion 
in 2004 and $71 billion in 2003.  Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  A number of our sales incentivessuch as bottler funding and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targets,  and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the 
period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  For interim reporting,  we estimate total annual sales incentives for most of our programs and record a pro rata share in proportion to revenue.  Certain arrangements extend beyond one year.  For examplefountain pouring rights may extend up to 15 years.  The costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the contract period as a reduction of revenue Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  and the remaining balances of $321 million at year-end 2005 and $337 million at year-end 2004 are included in current 
assets and other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts.  In 2005,  our method of determining the reserves was conformed across our divisions in connection with our BPT initiative,  as discussed above.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.  
Brand and Goodwill Valuations We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands and goodwill in acquisitions.  Upon acquisition,  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilitiesincluding brands,  based on estimated fair value,  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has significant market share in a stable macroeconomic environment and a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful liveswhich generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including the competitive environment,  market share,  brand history and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Goodwill,  including the goodwill that is part of our noncontrolled bottling investment balances,  and perpetual brands are 
not amortized.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that discounted future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value.  A perpetual brand is impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value,  the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows.  Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairmentthe asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on its discounted future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations,  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are consistent with our internal 
forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  As of December 312005,  we had $52 billion of perpetual brands and goodwill,  of which 70% related to Tropicana and Walkers.  
We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  
Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  See Note 5 for additional information regarding our tax reserves.  An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax benefits from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses 
that are not deductible in our tax returnand some differences reverse over timesuch as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have 
We repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the AJCA.  already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that tax jurisdiction.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but we have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) created a one-time incentive for U.S.  corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction.  As approved by our Board of Directors in July 2005,  we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In 2005,  we recorded income tax expense of $460 million associated with this repatriation.  Other than the earnings repatriatedwe intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and therefore have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  At December 31,  2005,  we had approximately $75 billion of undistributed international earnings.  In 2005,  our annual tax rate for continuing operations was 361% compared to 247% in 2004 as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2005 increased 114 percentage points primarily as a result of the AJCA tax charge and the absence of the 2004 tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain open tax items.  For 2006,  our annual tax rate is expected to be 280%,  primarily reflecting the absence of the AJCA tax charge and changes in our concentrate sourcing around the world.  
Stock-Based Compensation Expense We believe that we will achieve our best results if our employees act and are rewarded as business owners.  Thereforewe believe stock ownership and stockbased incentive awards are the best way to align the interests of employees with those of our shareholders.  Historically,  following competitive market practices,  we have used stock option grants as our primary form of long-term incentive compensation.  These grants are made at the current stock price,  meaning each employee is exercise price is equivalent to our stock price on the date of grant.  Employees must generally provide three additional years of service to earn the grant,  referred to as the vesting period.  Our options generally have a 10-year term,  which means our employees would have up to seven years after the 36 
vesting period to elect to pay the exercise price to purchase one share of our stock for each option exercised.  Employees benefit from stock options to the extent our stock price appreciates above the exercise price after vesting and during the term of the grant.  There have been no reductions to the exercise price of previously issued awards,  and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.  
We believe that we will achieve our best results if our employees act and are rewarded as business owners.  
Our new executive compensation program,  which became effective in 2004strengthens the relationship between pay and individual performance through greater differentiation in the amount of base paybonus and stock-based compensation based on an employee is job level and performance.  The new program results in a shift of both cash and stock-based compensation to our top performing executives.  In addition,  our new program provides executives,  who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performancewith a choice of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs).  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Each restricted stock unit can be settled in a 
share of our stock after the vesting period.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets.  We also continued,  as we have since 1989,  to grant an annual award of stock options to all eligible employees,  based on job level or classification under our broadbased stock option program,  SharePower.  As part of the new compensation program which began in 2004,  the SharePower program grant was reduced by approximately 50% for employees in the U.S.  and replaced with matching contributions of PepsiCo stock to our 401(k) savings plans.  
We did not reduce the SharePower award for international employees and continued using tenure,  in addition to job level and classification,  as a basis for the award.  For additional information on our 401(k) savings plans,  see Note 7.  Method of Accounting We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock-based compensation expense at the date of grant.  We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  under the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006.  We do not expect our adoption of SFAS 123R to materially impact our financial statements.  
Our Assumptions Our Black-Scholes model estimates the expected value our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions,  such as interest rates,  employee exercises,  our stock price and dividend yield.  Our weighted-average fair value assumptions include: 
Expected life Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
2006 Estimated Expense and Sensitivity of Assumptions Our stock-based compensation expense,  including RSUs,  is as follows: 
Stock-based compensation expense 
If we assumed a 100 basis point change in the following assumptions,  our estimated 2006 stock-based compensation expense would increase/(decrease) as follows: 
Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense andtherefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stockbased compensation expense is approximately 29% to FLNA,  22% to PBNA,  31% to PI,  4% to QFNA and 14% to corporate unallocated expenses.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Thereforeany variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  
The expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate,  volatility and dividend yield must be applied.  The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.  Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income,  share repurchases and stock price.  
If the expected life were assumed to be one year longer,  our estimated 2006 stock-based compensation expense would increase by $12 million.  If the expected life were assumed to be one year shorterour estimated 2006 stock-based compensation expense would decrease by $7 million.  As noted,  changing the assumed expected life impacts all of the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions as the risk free interest rate,  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are estimated over the expected life.  
Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generallyour share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts that vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost.  Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical plan obligations and associated expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of the benefits that employees earn while working,  as well as the present value of those benefits.  Annual pension and retiree medical expense 
The discount rate is based on interest rates for high-qualitylong-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities.  amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost),  (2) increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost),  and (3) other gains and losses as discussed below,  reduced by (4) expected return on plan assets for our funded plans.  Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense include: 
Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management is best judgment regarding future expectations.  Some of these assumptions require significant management judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expenses and obligations.  The assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses are determined as of September 30 (measurement date) and all plan assets and liabilities are generally reported as of that date.  At each measurement date,  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality,  long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities.  In the U.S.,  we utilize the Moody is AA Corporate Index yield and adjust for the differences between the average duration of the bonds in this Index and the average duration of our benefits liabilities based upon a published index.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience,  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return.  Our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk,  and cash requirements for benefit payments.  We use a third-party advisor to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long-term rate of return 
assumptions.  Our current investment allocation target for our U.S.  plans is 60% in equity securities,  with the balance in fixed income securities and cash.  Our expected long-term rate of return assumptions on U.S.  plan assets is 78%,  reflecting an estimated long-term return of 93% from equity securities and an estimated 58% from fixed income securities.  Approximately 80% of our pension plan assets relate to our U.S.  plans.  We use a market-related value method that recognizes each year is asset gain or loss over a five-year period.  Therefore,  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the other gains and losses calculation described below.  Other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions are also determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes which increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost) is included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of those expected to benefit,  which is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 13 years for retiree medical.  
 the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 
Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are the following: 
 certain employee-related factors,  such as turnover,  retirement age and mortality; 
Pension Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Expected rate of compensation increases Retiree medical Expense discount rate Current health care cost trend rate 
 for pension expense,  the expected return on assets in our funded plans and the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and  for retiree medical expense,  health care cost trend rates.  
Future Expense An analysis of the estimated change in pension and retiree medical expense follows: 
2005 expense Decrease in discount rate Increase in experience loss/(gain) amortization Impact of contributions Other,  including impact of 2003 Medicare Act 2006 estimated expense Our 2006 pension expense is estimated to be approximately $405 million and retiree medical expense is estimated to be approximately $126 million.  These estimates incorporate the 2006 assumptionsas well as the impact of the increased pension plan assets resulting from our discretionary contributions of $729 million in 2005 and the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) as discussed in Note 7.  Changes in our 2006 assumptions include updates to the lump sum discount rate for the U.S.  plans and to the mortality tables for certain international plans.  The estimated increase of $69 million in net experience loss amortization included in estimated 2006 pension expense primarily reflects the recognition of lower than expected returns and past asset losses,  which account for approximately $36 million of the increaseas well as assumption changes and demographic experience,  which account for approximately $20 million of the increase.  Pension service costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate but including the effect of demographic assumption changes,  as well as the effects of gains and losses due to demographics,  are reflected in division results.  The effect of changes in discount and asset return rates,  gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  and the impact of funding are reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  Approximately $26 million of the increased pension and retiree medical expense in 2006 will be reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  
Pension 
Retiree Medical 
Based on our current assumptions which reflect our prior experience,  current plan provisions,  and expectations for future experience,  and assuming the Board approves annual discretionary contributions of approximately $200 million,  we expect our pension expense to remain relatively flat in 2007.  In 2008,  we expect our pension expense to begin to decline,  with the expense dropping to approximately $305 million by 2011 as unrecognized experience losses are amortized.  If our assumptions and our plan provisions for retiree medical remain unchanged and our 
Our 2006 pension expense is estimated to be approximately $405 million and retiree medical expense is estimated to be approximately $126 million.  
an increase of approximately $16 million.  See Note 7 regarding the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  Future Funding We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions,  and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently deductible.  Our pension contributions for 2005 were $803 million,  of which $729 million was discretionary.  In 2006,  we expect contributions to be about $250 million with approximately $200 million expected to be discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be $85 million in 2006.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7.  
experience mirrors these assumptions,  we expect our annual retiree medical expense beyond 2006 to approximate $130 million.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  The estimated impact of a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate on 2006 pension expense is an increase of approximately $39 million.  The estimated impact on 2006 pension expense of a 25 basis point decrease in the expected rate of return assumption is 
Our Financial Results Items Affecting Comparability The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items: 
For the items and accounting changes affecting our 2003 results,  see Note 1 and our 2003 Annual Report.  53rd week In 2005,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each Decemberresulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  2005 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of 2005,  we incurred restructuring charges of $83 million to reduce costs in our operations,  principally through headcount reductions.  2004 Restructuring and Impairment Charges In the fourth quarter of 2004,  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of $150 million in conjunction with the consolidation of FLNA is manufacturing network in connection with its ongoing 
productivity program.  Savings from this productivity program have been used to offset increased marketplace spending.  AJCA Tax Charge As approved by our Board of Directors in July 2005,  in the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  in connection with the AJCA.  In 2005,  we recorded income tax expense of $460 million associated with this repatriation.  
Net Tax Benefits — Continuing Operations In the fourth quarter of 2004,  we recognized $45 million of tax benefits related to the completion of the U.S.  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for pre-merger Quaker open tax years.  In the third quarter of 2004,  we recognized $221 million of tax benefits related to a reduction in foreign tax accruals following the resolution of certain open tax issues with foreign tax authorities,  and a refund claim related to prior U.S.  tax settlements.  Tax Benefit from Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2004,  we reached agreement with the IRS for an open issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations which resulted in a tax benefit of $38 million.  
Results of Continuing Operations — Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below,  effective net pricing reflects the year-overyear impact of discrete pricing actions,  sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.  
Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e, kilos,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  
Total servings increased 7% in 2005 compared to 2004 as servings for beverages worldwide grew over 7% and servings for snacks worldwide grew 6%.  All of our divisions positively contributed to the total servings growth.  Total servings increased 6% in 2004 compared to 2003 as servings for beverages worldwide grew 7% and servings for snacks worldwide grew over 5%.  
Net Revenue and Operating Profit 2005 Net revenue increased 11% reflectingacross all divisions,  increased volumefavorable effective net pricing,  and net favorable foreign currency movements.  The volume gains contributed 6 percentage points,  the effective net pricing contributed 3 percentage points and the net favorable foreign currency movements contributed over 1 percentage point.  The 53rd week contributed over 1 percentage point to revenue growth and almost 1 percentage point to volume growth.  Total operating profit increased 13% and margin increased 02 percentage points.  Division operating profit increased 10% and margin decreased 02 percentage points.  The operating profit gains primarily reflect leverage from the revenue growthpartially offset by higher selling and distribution (S&D) expenses and increased cost of sales,  largely due to higher raw materialsenergy,  and S&D labor costs,  as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses.  In 2005,  division operating profit margin reflects our current year restructuring actions,  while total operating profit margin benefited from a favorable comparison to prior year restructuring and impairment charges.  The additional week in 2005 contributed over 1 percentage point to both total and division operating profit growth.  2004 Division net revenue increased 8%,  primarily due to strong volume gains across all divisions,  favorable product mix,  primarily 
Division net revenues Divested businesses Total net revenue Division operating profit Corporate unallocated Merger-related costs Impairment and restructuring charges Divested businesses Total operating profit Division operating profit margin Total operating profit margin 
at PBNA and PI,  and net favorable foreign currency movements.  The volume gains contributed over 4 percentage points,  the favorable mix contributed almost 2 percentage points,  and the net favorable foreign currency contributed almost 2 percentage points to division net revenue growth.  Total operating profit increased 10% and margin increased 03 percentage points.  Division operating profit increased 12% and division margin increased 05 percentage points.  These gains reflect leverage from the revenue growth,  partially offset by increased selling,  general and administrative expenses,  primarily corporate unallocated expenses.  In additiontotal operating profit growth reflects the absence of merger-related costs in 2004.  Corporate Unallocated Expenses Corporate unallocated expenses include the costs of our corporate headquarterscentrally managed initiatives such as our 
BPT initiative,  unallocated insurance and benefit programs,  foreign exchange transaction and certain commodity derivative gains and losses,  as well as profit-in-inventory elimination adjustments for our noncontrolled bottling affiliates and certain other items.  In 2005,  corporate unallocated expenses increased 14%.  This increase primarily reflects higher costs associated with our BPT initiative which contributed 7 percentage points,  increased support behind health and wellness and innovation initiatives which contributed 5 percentage points,  and Corporate departmental expenses and restructuring charges which each contributed 2 percentage points to the increase.  In 2005,  items of a nonrecurring nature included charges of $55 million to conform our method of accounting across all divisions,  primarily for warehouse and freight costs,  and a gain of $25 million in connection with the 
settlement of a class action lawsuit related to our purchases of high fructose corn syrup from 1991 to 1995.  In 2004,  we recorded a charge of $50 million for the settlement of a contractual dispute with a former business partner.  
In 2004,  corporate unallocated expenses increased 38%.  Higher employee-related costs contributed 18 percentage points of the increase,  an accrual recognized in the fourth quarter for the settlement of a contractual dispute with a former 
business partner represented 10 percentage points of the increase and higher costs related to our BPT initiative contributed 4 percentage points of the increase.  Corporate departmental expenses increased 2% compared to prior year.  
Other Consolidated Results Bottling equity income includes our share of the net income or loss of our noncontrolled bottling affiliates as described in 'Our Customers. " Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time.  Any gains or losses from these changes,  as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments,  are also included on a pre-tax basis.  We continue to sell shares of PBG stock to trim our ownership to the level at the time of PBG is initial public offering,  since our ownership has increased as a result of PBG is share repurchase program.  During 2005,  we sold 75 million shares of PBG stock.  The resulting lower ownership percentage reduces the equity income from PBG that we recognize.  2005 Bottling equity income increased 46% reflecting $126 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock,  as well as stronger bottler results.  In the first quarter of 2006,  PBG and PAS adopted SFAS 123R which will negatively impact our bottling equity income.  Net interest expense increased 4% reflecting the impact of higher debt levelssubstantially offset by higher investment rates and cash balances.  The tax rate increased 114 percentage points reflecting the $460 million tax charge related to our repatriation of undistributed international earnings,  as well as the absence of income tax benefits of $266 million recorded in the prior year related to a reduction in foreign tax accruals following the resolution of certain open tax items with foreign tax authorities and a 
Bottling equity income Interest expense,  net Annual tax rate Net income — continuing operations Net income per common share — continuing operations — diluted 
refund claim related to prior U.S.  tax settlements.  This increase was partially offset by increased international profit which is taxed at a lower rate.  Net income from continuing operations decreased 2% and the related net income per common share from continuing operations decreased 1%.  These decreases reflect the impact of the tax items discussed above,  partially offset by our operating profit growth,  increased bottling equity income,  which includes the gain on our PBG stock sale,  the impact of the 53rd week,  a favorable comparison to prior year restructuring and impairment charges,  and for net income per share,  the impact of our share repurchases.  2004 Bottling equity income increased 18%primarily reflecting increased earnings from our anchor bottlers and favorable comparisons from international bottling investments,  primarily as a result of the nationwide strike in Venezuela in early 2003.  Net interest expense declined 17% primarily due to favorable interest rates and higher average cash balances,  partially offset by higher average debt balances and lower gains in the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability.  
The offsetting increase in deferred compensation costs is reported in corporate unallocated expenses.  The annual tax rate decreased 38 percentage points compared to the prior yearprimarily as a result of tax benefits from the resolution of open items with tax authorities in both years,  as discussed in 'Items Affecting Comparability. " The tax benefits reduced our tax rate by 26 percentage points.  Increased benefit from concentrate operations and favorable changes arising from agreements with the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2003 also contributed to the decline in rate.  Net income from continuing operations increased 17% and the related net income per common share from continuing operations increased 18%.  These increases primarily reflect the solid operating profit growth and our lower annual tax rate.  The absence of merger-related costs in 2004 and increased bottling equity income also contributed to the growth.  
Results of Continuing Operations — Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions.  Prior year amounts exclude the results of divested businesses.  For additional information on these items and our divisions,  see Note 1.

(a) For beverages sold to our bottlers,  net revenue volume growth is based on our concentrate shipments and equivalents.  (b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding.  
Frito-Lay North America % Change Net revenue Operating profit 2005 Net revenue grew 8% reflecting volume growth of 45% and positive effective net pricing driven by salty snack pricing actions and favorable mix on both salty and convenience foods products.  Pound volume grew primarily due to mid singledigit growth in trademark Lay is potato chips,  high single-digit growth in salty trademark Tostitos,  double-digit growth in Santitas,  mid single-digit growth in trademark Cheetos,  high single-digit growth in Dips and Fritos,  and double-digit growth in Sun Chips.  These gains were partially offset by the discontinuance of Toastables and Doritos Rollitos.  Overall,  salty snacks revenue grew 8% with volume growth of 5%and convenience foods products revenue grew 13% with volume growth of 1%.  Convenience foods products revenue benefited from favorable mix.  The additional week contributed 2 percentage points to volume and net revenue growth.  Operating profit grew 6% reflecting positive effective net pricing actions and volume growth.  This growth was offset by 
higher S&D costs resulting from increased labor and benefit charges and fuel costs; higher cost of sales,  driven by raw materials,  natural gas and freight; and increased advertising and marketing costs.  Operating profit was also negatively impacted by more than 1 percentage point as a result 
FLNA volume grew 45% in 2005 and 3% in 2004.  of fourth quarter charges to reduce costs in our operations,  principally through headcount reductions.  The additional week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.  Products qualifying for our new Smart Spot program represented approximately 13% of net revenue.  These products experienced double-digit revenue growth,  while the balance of the portfolio had high single-digit revenue growth.  See our website at www, smartspot, com for additional information on our Smart Spot program.  
2004 Net revenue grew 5% reflecting volume growth of 3% and positive effective net pricing due to salty snack pricing actions and favorable mix.  Pound volume grew primarily due to new products,  single-digit growth in Lay is Classic potato chips,  strong double-digit growth in Variety Pack and mid single-digit growth in Tostitos and Fried Cheetos.  Lay is Stax and Doritos Rollitos led the new product growth.  These gains were partially offset by single-digit declines in Doritos and Fritos and double-digit declines in Rold Gold and Quaker Toastables.  Operating profit grew nearly 7% reflecting the positive pricing actions and volume growth.  Higher commodity costs,  driven by corn oil and energy costs were largely offset by cost leverage generated from ongoing productivity initiatives.  Smart Spot eligible products represented approximately 10% of 2004 FLNA net revenue.  These products experienced high single-digit revenue growth and the balance of the portfolio had mid singledigit revenue growth.  
PepsiCo Beverages North America % Change Net revenue Operating profit 2005 Net revenue grew 10% and volume grew 4%.  The volume increase was driven by a 16% increase in non-carbonated beverages,  partially offset by a 1% decline in CSDs.  Within non-carbonated beveragesGatorade,  Trademark Aquafina,  Tropicana juice drinks,  Propel and SoBe all experienced double-digit growth.  Above average summer temperatures across the countryas well as the launch of new products such as Aquafina FlavorSplash and Gatorade Lemonade earlier in the year,  drove Gatorade and Trademark Aquafina growth.  Tropicana Pure Premium experienced a low single-digit decline resulting from price 
Gatorade,  Trademark Aquafina,  Tropicana juice drinks,  Propel and SoBe all experienced double-digit volume growth in 2005.  increases taken in the first quarter.  The decline in CSDs reflects low single-digit declines in Trademark Pepsi and Trademark Mountain Dew,  slightly offset by low singledigit growth in Sierra Mist.  Across the brands,  a low single-digit decline in regular CSDs was partially offset by low single-digit growth in diet CSDs.  The additional week in 2005 had no significant impact on volume growth as bottler volume is reported based on a calendar month.  
Net revenue also benefited from 5 percentage points of favorable effective net pricing,  reflecting the continued migration from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages and price increases taken in the first quarter,  primarily on concentrate and Tropicana Pure Premium,  partially offset by increased trade spending in the current year.  The additional week in 2005 contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  Operating profit increased nearly 7%primarily reflecting net revenue growth.  This increase was partially offset by higher raw material,  energy,  and transportation costs,  as well as increased advertising and marketing expenses.  The additional week in 2005 contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth and was fully offset by a 1 percentage point decline related to charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2005 to reduce costs in our operationsprincipally through headcount reductions.  Smart Spot eligible products represented almost 70% of net revenue.  These products experienced double-digit revenue growth,  while the balance of the portfolio grew in the low single-digit range.  2004 Net revenue increased 7% and volume increased 3%.  The volume increase reflects non-carbonated beverage growth of 10% and a slight increase in CSDs.  The non-carbonated beverage growth was fueled by double-digit growth in GatoradeAquafina and Propel,  as well as the introduction of bottler-distributed Tropicana juice drinks.  Tropicana Pure Premium 
increased slightly for the year.  The carbonated soft drink performance reflects a low single-digit increase in Trademark Mountain Dew and a slight increase in Trademark Sierra Mist,  offset by a slight decline in Trademark Pepsi.  Across the trademarks,  high single-digit diet CSD growth was substantially offset by a low single-digit decline in regular CSDs.  The increase in Trademark Mountain Dew reflects growth in both Diet and regular Mountain Dew and the limited time only offering of Mountain Dew Pitch Blacksubstantially offset by declines in both Mountain Dew Code Red and LiveWire.  The performance of Trademark Pepsi reflects declines in regular Pepsi,  Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Blue,  mostly offset by increases in Diet Pepsi and the introduction of Pepsi Edge.  Favorable product mix contributed 3 percentage points to net revenue growth,  primarily reflecting a migration to non-carbonated beverages.  Additionallyconcentrate and fountain price increases taken in the first quarter contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  Operating profit increased 13% reflecting the net revenue growth,  partially offset by higher selling,  general and administrative costs,  as well as costs related to marketplace initiatives.  Smart Spot eligible products represented over 60% of net revenue.  These products experienced high single-digit revenue growth,  and the balance of the portfolio had mid single-digit revenue growth.  
PepsiCo International % Change Net revenue Operating profit 2005 International snacks volume grew 7%reflecting growth of 11% in the EuropeMiddle East & Africa region,  5% in the Latin America region and 6% in the Asia Pacific region.  Acquisition and divestiture activity,  principally the divestiture last year of our interest in a South Korea joint venture,  reduced Asia region volume by 11 percentage points.  The acquisition of a business in Romania late in 2004 increased the Europe,  Middle East & Africa region volume growth by 3 percentage points.  Cumulatively,  our divestiture and acquisition activities did not impact the reported total PepsiCo International snack volume growth rate.  The overall gains reflected mid single-digit growth at Sabritas in Mexico,  double-digit growth in India,  Turkey,  Russia,  Australia and Chinapartially offset by a low single-digit decline at Walkers in the United Kingdom.  The decline at Walkers is due principally to marketplace pressures.  The additional week contributed 1 percentage point to international snack volume growth.  Beverage volume grew 11%,  reflecting growth of 14% in the Europe,  Middle East & Africa region,  11% in the Asia Pacific region and 6% in the Latin America region.  Acquisitions had no significant impact on the reported total PepsiCo International beverage volume growth rate.  Broad-based increases were led by double-digit growth in the Middle East,  China,  ArgentinaVenezuela and Russia.  Carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages both grew at a double-digit rate.  The additional week had no impact on beverage volume growth as volume is reported based on a calendar month.  Net revenue grew 15%,  primarily as a result of the broad-based volume growth and favorable effective net pricing.  Foreign currency contributed almost 3 percentage 
points of growth reflecting the favorable Mexican peso and Brazilian real,  partially offset by the unfavorable British pound.  Acquisitions and divestitures contributed almost 2 percentage points of growth.  The additional week contributed 1 percentage point to revenue growth.  Cumulatively,  the impact of foreign currency,  acquisitions and divestitures,  and the additional week on net revenue was 5 percentage points.  Operating profit grew 21% driven largely by the broad-based volume growth and favorable effective net pricingpartially offset by increased energy and raw material costs.  Foreign currency contributed 4 percentage points of growth based on the favorable Mexican peso and Brazilian real.  The net favorable impact from acquisition and divestiture activityprimarily the acquisition of General Mills' minority interest in Snack Ventures Europe in Q1 2005,  contributed 2 percentage

The additional week contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth which was fully offset by a 1 percentage point decline in operating profit growth related to fourth quarter charges to reduce costs in our operations and rationalize capacity.  2004 International snacks volume grew 8%comprised of 7% in our Latin America region,  8% in our Europe,  Middle East & Africa region and 14% in our Asia Pacific region.  These gains were driven by high single-digit growth at Sabritas in Mexicostrong double-digit growth in India,  low

Beverage volume grew 12%,  comprised of 14% in our Europe,  Middle East & Africa region,  15% in our Asia Pacific region and 8% in our Latin America region.  Broad-based increases were led by doubledigit growth in the Middle East and Chinahigh single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in India,  Germany,  Russia and Venezuela.  Favorable comparisons as a result of the 2003 national strike in Venezuela and the German deposit law impact contributed to the growth in Venezuela and Germany.  Both carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages grew at double-digit rates.  Net revenue grew 14% driven by the broad-based volume growth and favorable mix.  Foreign currency impact contributed 4 percentage points of growth driven by the favorable British pound and europartially offset by the unfavorable Mexican peso.  Acquisitions contributed less than 1 percentage point.  Operating profit grew 25% driven largely by the volume and favorable mix.  The favorable comparison of certain reserve actions taken in 2003 on potentially unrecoverable beverage assets contributed 2 percentage points of growth.  Foreign currency impact contributed almost 3 percentage points of growth driven by the favorable British pound and euro,  partially offset by the unfavorable Mexican peso.

The volume increase reflects double-digit growth in OatmealAunt Jemima syrup and mix,  Rice-A-Roni and Pasta Roni,  as well as high single-digit growth in Cap n Crunch cereal and mid single-digit growth in Life cereal.  Higher effective net pricing contributed nearly 3 percentage points of growth reflecting favorable product mix,  the settlement of prior year trade spending accruals and price increases on ready-to-eat cereals taken in the third quarter of 2004.  Favorable Canadian exchange rates contributed nearly 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  The additional week in 2005 contributed approximately 2 percentage points to both net revenue and volume growth.  Operating profit increased 13% reflecting the net revenue growth.  This growth was partially offset by higher advertising and marketing costs behind programs for core brands and innovation,  as well as an unfavorable cost of sales comparison 
primarily due to higher energy and raw materials costs in the latter part of 2005.  The additional week in 2005 contributed approximately 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Our Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position Our strong cash-generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world.  Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow.  This cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating,  investing and financing needs.  In addition,  we have revolving credit facilities that are further discussed in Note 9.  Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.

Operating Activities In 2005,  our operations provided $59 billion of cash compared to $51 billion in the prior year.  The increase reflects our solid business results,  as well as lower taxes paid in the current year as 2004 tax payments included a $760 million tax payment related to our 2003 settlement with the IRS.  This increase was partially offset by $803 million of pension plan contributions in the current year,  of which $729 million was discretionary,  compared to pension payments of $458 million in the prior year,  of which $400 million was discretionary.  Investing Activities In 2005,  we used $35 billion,  primarily reflecting capital spending of $17 billionacquisitions of $11 billion,  primarily the $750 million acquisition of General Mills' minority interest in Snack Ventures Europeand net purchases of short-term investments of $10 billion.  These amounts were partially offset by the proceeds from our sale of PBG stock of $214 million.  In 2004,  we used $23 billion for investingprimarily reflecting capital spending of $14 billion and short-term investments of almost $10 billion.  In the first quarter of 2006,  we completed our acquisition of Stacy is Pita Chip Company which was funded with existing domestic cash.  This acquisition will be 
included in the first quarter of 2006 as an investing activity in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  We anticipate net capital spending of approximately $22 billion in 2006,  which is above our long-term target of approximately 5% of net revenue.  Planned capital spending in 2006 includes increased investments in manufacturing capacity to support growth in our China snack and beverage operations and our North American Gatorade business,  as well as increased investment in support of our ongoing BPT initiative.  We expect capital spending to return to our long-term targeted rate following 2006.  Financing Activities In 2005,  we used $19 billion,  primarily reflecting common share repurchases of $30 billion and dividend payments of $16 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $18 billion and stock option proceeds of $11 billion.  This compares to $23 billion used for financing in 2004,  primarily reflecting share repurchases at a cost of $30 billion and dividend payments of $13 billion,  partially offset by net issuances of short-term borrowings of $11 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of nearly $10 billion.  In 2004,  our Board of Directors authorized a new $70 billion share repurchase program.  Since inception of the new pro Use of Cash 
gram,  we have repurchased $51 billion of shares,  leaving $19 billion of remaining authorization.  We target an annual dividend payout of approximately 45% of prior year is net income from continuing operations.  Each spring we review our capital structure with our Board,  including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value,  and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  it is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities Capital spending Sales of property,  plant and equipment Management operating cash flow Management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return approximately all of our management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  However,  see 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.  Credit Ratings Our debt ratings of Aa3 from Moody is and A+ from Standard & Poor is contribute to our ability to access global capital markets.  We have maintained strong investment grade ratings for over a decade.  Our Moody is rating reflects an upgrade from A1 to Aa3 in 2004 due to the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows.  Each rating is considered strong investment grade and is in the first quartile of their respective 
ranking systems.  These ratings also reflect the impact of our anchor bottlers' cash flows and debt.

Financial Position Significant changes in our Consolidated Balance Sheet from December 25,  2004 to December 31,  2005 not discussed above were as follows: 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business,  nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers,  noncontrolled affiliates or third parties.  However,  certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us.  As of year-end 2005,  we believe it is remote 
 Other assets increased primarily reflecting our increased pension contributions in the current year.   Income taxes payable increased primarily reflecting $460 million of taxes accrued related to our repatriation of international earnings in connection with the AJCA to be paid in the first quarter of 2006.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions 
Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In additionwe include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our economic ownership interest.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Our share of the net income of noncontrolled bottling affiliates is reported in our income statement as bottling equity income.  Bottling equity income also includes any changes in our ownership interests of these affiliates.  In 2005,  bottling equity income includes $126 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock.  See Note 8 for additional information on our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Our share of other noncontrolled affiliates is included in division operating profit.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  In 2005,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  
In connection with our ongoing BPT initiative,  we aligned certain accounting policies across our divisions in 2005.  We conformed our methodology for calculating our bad debt reserves and modified our policy for recognizing revenue for products shipped to customers by third-party carriers.  Additionally,  we conformed our method of accounting for certain costsprimarily warehouse and freight.  These changes reduced our net revenue by $36 million and our operating profit by $60 million in 2005.  We also made certain reclassifications on our Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of 2005 from cost of sales to sellinggeneral and administrative expenses in connection with our BPT initiative.  These reclassifications resulted in reductions to cost of sales of $556 million through the third quarter of 2005,  $732 million in the full year 2004 and $688 million in the full year 2003,  with corresponding increases to selling,  general and administrative expenses in those periods.  These reclassifications had no net impact on operating profit and have been made to all periods presented for comparability.  
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands and goodwill,  useful lives for intangible assets,  tax reserves,  stock-based compensation and pension and retiree medical accruals.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  See 'Our Divisions" below and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results,  see 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless noted,  and are based on unrounded amounts.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the 2005 presentation.  
ning in the fourth quarter of 2005,  we began centrally managing commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  Certain of the commodity derivativesprimarily those related to the purchase of energy for use by our divisions,  do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.  Such derivatives are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized as a component of corporate unallocated expense.  These gains and losses are reflected in division results when the divisions take 
delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  division results reflect the contract purchase price of the energy or other commodities.  Division results are based on how our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer evaluates our divisions.  Division results exclude certain Corporate-initiated restructuring and impairment charges,  mergerrelated costs and divested businesses.  For additional unaudited information on our divisions,  see 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Our Divisions We manufacture or use contract manufacturers,  market and sell a variety of saltysweet and grain-based snacks,  carbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  and foods through our North American and international business divisions.  Our North American divisions include the United States and Canada.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for certain allocation methodologies for stock-based compensation expense and pension and retiree medical expense,  as described in the unaudited information in 'Our Critical Accounting Policies.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for direct-storedelivery (DSD) and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-ofdate products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for warehouse distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our historical experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and outof-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customers,  Wal-Mart and PBG.  Wal-Mart represents approximately 9% of our net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart; and PBG represents approximately 10%.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  
sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Other marketplace spending includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities and is reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Advertising expenses were $18 billion in 2005$17 billion in 2004 and $16 billion in 2003.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:  media and personal service prepayments promotional materials in inventory,  and  production costs of future media advertising.  Deferred advertising costs of $202 million and $137 million at year-end 2005 and 2004,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to our customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $89 billion in 2005$78 billion in 2004 and $71 billion in 2003.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements extend beyond one year.  For example,  fountain pouring rights may extend up to 15 years.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the contract period and the remaining balances of $321 million at December 31,  2005 and $337 million at December 25,  2004 are included in current assets and other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our 
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less which we do not intend to rollover beyond three months.  
Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $41 billion in 2005$39 billion in 2004 and $36 billion in 2003.  
Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which generally do not exceed 5 years.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $327 million at December 31,  2005 and $181 million at December 25,  2004.  
Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9.

Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Merger-Related Costs 2005 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of 2005,  we incurred a charge of $83 million ($55 million aftertax or $003 per share) in conjunction with actions taken to reduce costs in our operations,  principally through headcount reductions.  Of this charge,  $34 million related to FLNA,  $21 million to PBNA,  $16 million to PI and $12 million to Corporate (recorded in corporate unallocated expenses).  Most of this charge related to the termination of approximately 700 employees.  We expect the substantial portion of the cash payments related to this charge to be paid in 2006.  2004 and 2003 Restructuring and Impairment Charges In the fourth quarter of 2004,  we incurred a charge of $150 million ($96 million after-tax or $006 per share) in conjunction with the consolidation of FLNA is manufacturing network as part of its ongoing productivity program.  Of this charge $93 million related to asset impairmentprimarily reflecting the closure of four U.S.  plants.  Production from these plants was redeployed to other FLNA facilities in the U.S.  The remaining $57 million included employee-related costs of $29 millioncontract termination costs of $8 million and other exit costs of $20 million.  Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 700 employees.  Through December 312005,  we have paid $47 million and incurred non-cash charges of $10 millionleaving substantially no accrual.  In the fourth quarter of 2003,  we incurred a charge of $147 million ($100 million after-tax or $006 per share) in conjunction with actions taken to streamline our North American divisions and PepsiCo International.  These actions were taken to increase focus and eliminate redundancies at PBNA and PI and to improve the efficiency of the supply chain 
at FLNA.  Of this charge,  $81 million related to asset impairment,  reflecting $57 million for the closure of a snack plant in Kentucky,  the retirement of snack manufacturing lines in Maryland and Arkansas and $24 million for the closure of a PBNA office building in Florida.  The remaining $66 million included employeerelated costs of $54 million and facility and other exit costs of $12 million.  Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 850 sales,  distribution,  manufacturingresearch and marketing employees.  As of December 31,  2005,  all terminations had occurred and substantially no accrual remains.  Merger-Related Costs In connection with the Quaker merger in 2001,  we recognized merger-related costs of $59 million ($42 million after-tax or $002 per share) in 2003.

Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset is estimated useful life.  Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years,  based on average 2005 foreign exchange rates,  is expected to be $152 million in 2006,  $35 million in 2007,  $35 million in 2008,  $34 million in 2009 and $33 million in 2010.  Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on discounted future cash flows.  Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.  For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Nonamortizable Intangible Assets Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure that discounted future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value.  A perpetual brand is impaired if its book value exceeds its fair value.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value,  the asset is written down based on its discounted future cash flows to fair value.  No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations.  The change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets is as follows:

Carryforwards,  Credits and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $51 billion at year-end 2005 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $01 billion in 2006,  $41 billion between 2007 and 2025 and $09 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  In additioncertain tax credits generated in prior periods of approximately $394 million are available to reduce certain foreign tax liabilities through 2011.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit.  Undistributed International Earnings The AJCA created a one-time incentive for U.S.  corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 
85% dividends received deduction.  As approved by our Board of Directors in July 2005,  we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In 2005,  we recorded income tax expense of $460 million associated with this repatriation.  Other than the earnings repatriated,  we intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  therefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  At December 31,  2005,  we had approximately $75 billion of undistributed international earnings.  Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  During 2004,  we recognized $266 million of tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain open tax issues.  In additionin 2004,  we recognized a tax benefit of $38 million upon agreement with the IRS on an open issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations.  At the end of 2003 we entered into agreements with the IRS for open years through 1997.  These agreements resulted in a tax benefit of $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.  As part of these agreements,  we also resolved the treatment of certain other issues related to future tax years.  The IRS has initiated their audits of our tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  Our tax returns subsequent to 2002 have not yet been examined.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  Our tax reserves,  covering all federal,  state and foreign jurisdictions,  are presented in the balance sheet within other liabilities (see Note 14),  except for any amounts relating to items we expect to pay in the coming year which are included in current income taxes payable.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results. " 
Note 6 — Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  Employees at all levels participate in our stock-based compensation program.  In addition,  members of our Board of Directors participate in our stockbased compensation program in connection with their service on our Board.  Stock options and RSUs are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  our only active stock-based plan.  Stock-based compensation expense was $311 million in 2005,  $368 million in 2004 and $407 million in 2003.  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $87 million in 2005,  $103 million in 2004 and $114 million in 2003.  At yearend 2005,  51 million shares were available for future executive and SharePower grants.  For additional unaudited informa tion on our stock-based compensation program,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  SharePower Grants SharePower options are awarded under our LTIP to all eligible employees,  based on job level or classification,  and in the case of international employees,  tenure as well.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the day of grant and generally have a 10-year term with vesting after three years.  Executive Grants All senior management and certain middle management are eligible for executive grants under our LTIP.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the day of grant and generally have a 10-year term with vesting after three years.  There have been no reductions to the exer cise price of previously issued awards,  and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.  Beginning in 2004,  executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Each restricted stock unit can be settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets.  We granted 3 million RSUs in both 2005 and 2004 with weighted-average intrinsic values of $5383 and $4728,  respectively.  
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions include: 
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock-based compensation expense at the date of grant.  We adopted SFAS 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  under the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006.  We do not expect our adoption of SFAS 123R to materially impact our financial statements.

Note 7 — Pension,  Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the costs.  We use a September 30 measurement date and all plan assets and liabilities are generally 
reported as of that date.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost) is included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits.  The Medicare Act was signed into law in December 2003 and we applied the provisions of the Medicare Act to our plans in 2005 and 2004.  The Medicare Act provides a subsidy for sponsors of retiree medical plans who offer drug benefits equivalent to those provided under Medicare.  As a result of the Medicare Act Pension 2003 2005 
our 2005 and 2004 retiree medical costs were $11 million and $7 million lowerrespectively,  and our 2005 and 2004 liabilities were reduced by $136 million and $80 million,  respectively.  We expect our 2006 retiree medical costs to be approximately $18 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of the Medicare Act.

Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 
Pension Retiree medical 
These future benefits to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded pension plans.  Pension Assets The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience,  our pension plan investment guidelines,  and our expectations for long-term rates of return.  We use a market-related value method that recognizes each year is asset gain or loss over a five-year period.  Therefore,  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the value of pension plan assets that is used to calculate the expected return.  Our

Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 10% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2006.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 
2005 service and interest cost components 2005 benefit liability 
Savings Plans Our U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans,  which are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The 
pension plan investment guidelines are established based upon an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they are due.  Our investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectation.  Our target 
allocation and actual pension plan asset allocations for the plan years 2005 and 2004,  are below.  Pension assets include approximately 55 million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a market value of $311 million in 2005,  and 55 million shares with a market value of $267 million in 2004.  Our investment policy limits the investment in PepsiCo stock at the time of investment to 10% of the fair value of plan assets.  
5% in 2010 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability.  However,  the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits 
the impact.  A 1 percentage point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects: 
plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement.  We make matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of 
service.  In 2005 and 2004,  our matching contributions were $52 million and $35 million,  respectively.  
Note 8 — Noncontrolled Bottling Affiliates Our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates are PBG and PAS.  Approximately 10% of our net revenue in 2005,  2004 and 2003 reflects sales to PBG.  
The Pepsi Bottling Group In addition to approximately 41% and 42% of PBG is outstanding common stock that we own at year-end 2005 and 2004respectively,  we own 100% of PBG is class B common stock and approximately 7% of the equity of Bottling Group,  LLC,  PBG is 
principal operating subsidiary.  This gives us economic ownership of approximately 45% and 46% of PBG is combined operations at year-end 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  In 2005,  bottling equity income includes $126 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock.  
PBG is summarized financial information is as follows:

Related Party Transactions Our significant related party transactions involve our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  We sell concentrate to these affiliateswhich is used in the production of carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated bever Net revenue Selling,  general and administrative expenses Accounts and notes receivable Accounts payable and other current liabilities Such amounts are settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables.  See Note 9 regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt.  In addition,  we coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the negotiation and purchase of sweeteners and other raw materials 
ages.  We also sell certain finished goods to these affiliates and we receive royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products.  Sales of concentrate and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding.  For further unaudited information 
Our investment in PBG,  which includes the related goodwill,  was $400 million and $321 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year-end 2005 and 2004,  the calculated market value of our shares in PBG,  excluding our investment in Bottling Group,  LLCexceeded our investment balance by approximately $15 billion and $17 billion,  respectively.  
Our investment in PAS,  which includes the related goodwill,  was $292 million and $253 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year-end 2005 and 2004,  the calculated market value of our shares in PepsiAmericas exceeded our investment balance by approximately $364 million and $277 million,  respectively.  In January 2005,  PAS acquired a regional bottler,  Central Investment Corporation.  The table above includes the results of Central Investment Corporation from the transaction date forward.  
on these bottlers,  see 'Our Customers" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows: 
requirements for certain of our bottlers with suppliers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the 
contracting party,  we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  
Note 9 — Debt Obligations and Commitments Short-term debt obligations Current maturities of long-term debt Commercial paper (33% and 16%) Other borrowings (74% and 66%) Amounts reclassified to long-term debt Long-term debt obligations Short-term borrowings,  reclassified Notes due 2006-2026 (54% and 47%) Zero coupon notes,  $475 million due 2006-2012 (134%) Other,  due 2006-2014 (63% and 62%) Less: current maturities of long-term debt obligations 
The interest rates in the above table reflect weighted-average rates as of year-end.  
Short-term borrowings are reclassified to long-term when we have the intent and ability,  through the existence of the unused lines of credit,  to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.  At year-end 2005,  we maintained $21 billion in corporate lines of credit subject to normal banking terms and conditions.  These credit facilities support short-term debt issuances and remained unused as of December 312005.  Of the $21 billion,  $135 billion expires in May 2006 with the remaining $750 million expiring in June 2009.  In addition,  $181 million of our debt was outstanding on various lines of credit maintained for our international divisions.  
These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are committed to the extent of our borrowings.  Interest Rate Swaps We entered into interest rate swaps in 2004 to effectively convert the interest rate of a specific debt issuance from a fixed rate of 32% to a variable rate.  The variable weighted-average interest rate that we pay is linked to LIBOR and is subject to change.  The notional amount of the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31,  2005 and December 25,  2004 was $500 million.  The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The swaps mature in 2007.  
At December 31,  2005,  approximately 78% of total debt,  after the impact of the associated interest rate swaps,  was exposed to variable interest rates,  compared to 67% at December 25,  2004.  In addition to variable rate long-term debt,  all debt with maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.  Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps In 2004,  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge the currency exposure on U.S.  dollar denominated debt of $50 million held by a foreign affiliate.  The terms of this swap match the terms of the debt it modifies.  The swap matures in 2008.  The unrecognized gain related to this swap was less than $1 million at December 31,  2005,  resulting in a U.S.  dollar liability of $50 million.  At December 25,  2004,  the unrecognized loss related to this swap was $3 million,  resulting in a U.S.  dollar liability of $53 million.  We have also entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure on U.S.  dollar denominated intercompany debt of $125 million.  The terms of the swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The swaps mature over the next two years.  The net unrecognized gain related to these swaps was $5 million at December 31,  2005.  The net unrecognized loss related to these swaps was less than $1 million at December 25,  2004.  
Long-Term Contractual Commitments 
(a) Excludes current maturities of long-term debt of $143 million which are classified within current liabilities.  (b) Includes approximately $13 million of long-term commitments which are reflected in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
The above table reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 31,  2005 based on year-end foreign exchange rates.  
Most long-term contractual commitments,  except for our long-term debt obligations,  are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Non-cancelable operating leases primarily represent building leases.  Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges and orange juices to be used for our Tropicana brand beverages.  Non-cancelable marketing commitments primarily are for sports marketing and with our fountain customers.  Bottler funding is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis.  See Note 7 regarding our pension and retiree medical 
obligations and discussion below regarding our commitments to noncontrolled bottling affiliates and former restaurant operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business,  nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers,  noncontrolled affiliates or third parties.  However,  certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us.  In connection with these transactions,  we have guaranteed $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt through 2012 and $28 million of YUM! Brands,  Inc.  (YUM) outstanding obligations,  primarily 
property leases,  through 2020.  The terms of our Bottling Group,  LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the structure of PBG is separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling Group,  LLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed.  Our guarantees of certain obligations ensured YUM is continued use of certain properties.  These guarantees would require our cash payment if YUM failed to perform under these lease obligations.  See 'Our Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Note 10 — Risk Management We are exposed to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange risks interest rates stock prices,  and  discount rates affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a result,  any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings 
impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related gain or loss and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction,  we recognize the related gain or loss in net income in that period.  We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we limit our exposure to individual counterparties to manage credit risk.  Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders,  pricing agreements,  geographic diversity and derivatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than two years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for natural gas and diesel fuel.  For those derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  However,  our commodity cash flow hedges have not had any significant ineffectiveness for all periods presented.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify gains of $24 million related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate over a third of our net revenue of which Mexico,  the United Kingdom and Canada comprise nearly 20%.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks from unforeseen economic changes and political unrest.  On occasion,  we enter into hedgesprimarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rates.  Ineffectiveness on these hedges has not been material.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  These swaps are entered into 
concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  These swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  
Stock Prices The portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on certain market indices and on our stock price is subject to market risk.  We hold mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts to manage this risk.  Changes in the fair value of these investments and contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and are offset by changes in the related compensation liability.  
Fair Value All derivative instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.  The fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices.  Book and fair values of our derivative and financial instruments are as follows: 
Book Value 
Fair Value

Included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet under the captions noted above or as indicated below.  In addition,  derivatives are designated as accounting hedges unless otherwise noted below.  (a) Book value approximates fair value due to the short maturity.  (b) Principally short-term time deposits and includes $124 million at December 31,  2005 and $118 million at December 25,  2004 of mutual fund investments used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.  (c) 2005 asset includes $14 million related to derivatives not designated as accounting hedges.  Assets are reported within current assets and other assets and liabilities are reported within current liabilities and other liabilities.  (d) 2005 asset includes $2 million related to derivatives not designated as accounting hedges and the liability relates entirely to derivatives not designated as accounting hedges.  Assets are reported within current assets and other assets and liabilities are reported within current liabilities and other liabilities.  (e) Included in current assets and other assets.  (f) Asset included within other assets and liability included in long-term debt.  (g) Reported in other liabilities.  
This table excludes guarantees,  including our guarantee of $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt.  The guarantee had a fair value of $47 million at December 31,  2005 and $46 million at December 25,  2004 based on an external estimate of the cost to us of transferring the liability to an independent financial institution.  See Note 9 for additional information on our guarantees.  
Note 11 — Net Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations Basic net income per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if 
in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 30 million shares in 2005,  70 million shares in 2004 and 490 million shares in 2003 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these 
options were out-of-the-money.  Out-of-themoney options had average exercise prices of $5377 in 2005,  $5288 in 2004 and $4827 in 2003.  
The computations of basic and diluted net income per common share from continuing operations are as follows: 
2005 Net income Preferred shares: Dividends Redemption premium Net income available for common shareholders Basic net income per common share Net income available for common shareholders Dilutive securities: Stock options and RSUs ESOP convertible preferred stock Unvested stock awards Diluted Diluted net income per common share 
Note 12 — Preferred and Common Stock As of December 31,  2005 and December 25,  2004,  there were 36 billion shares of common stock and 3 million shares of convertible preferred stock authorized.  The preferred stock was issued only for an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) established by Quaker and these shares are redeemable for common stock by the ESOP participants.  The preferred stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of $546 per share.  At year-end 2005 and 
2004,  there were 803953 preferred shares issued and 354853 and 424853 shares outstanding,  respectively.  Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into 49625 shares of common stock.  The preferred shares may be called by us upon written notice at $78 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  As of December 31,  2005,  03 million outstanding shares of preferred stock with a fair value of $104 million and 17 million 
2005 Preferred stock Repurchased preferred stock Balance,  beginning of year Redemptions Balance,  end of year 
shares of common stock were held in the accounts of ESOP participants.  As of December 25,  2004,  04 million outstanding shares of preferred stock with a fair value of $110 million and 18 million shares of common stock were held in the accounts of ESOP participants.  Quaker made the final award to its ESOP plan in June 2001.

Note 13 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive income is a measure of income which includes both net income and other comprehensive income or loss.  Other comprehensive loss results from items deferred on the balance sheet in shareholders' equity.  Other comprehensive (loss)/income was $(167) million in 2005$381 million in 2004,  and $405 million in 2003.  The accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive loss were as follows: 
Currency translation adjustment Cash flow hedges,  net of tax(a) Minimum pension liability adjustment(b) Unrealized gain on securities,  net of tax Other Accumulated other comprehensive loss 
(a) Includes net commodity gains of $55 million in 2005.  Also includes no impact in 2005,  $6 million gain in 2004 and $8 million gain in 2003 for our share of our equity investees' accumulated derivative activity.  Deferred gains/(losses) reclassified into earnings were $8 million in 2005,  $(10) million in 2004 and no impact in 2003.  (b) Net of taxes of $72 million in 2005,  $77 million in 2004 and $67 million in 2003.  Also,  includes $120 million in 2005,  $121 million in 2004 and $110 million in 2003 for our share of our equity investees' minimum pension liability adjustments.  
(a) Includes accounts written off.  (b) Includes collections of previously written-off accounts and currency translation effects.  (c) Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the average,  first-in,  first-out (FIFO) or last-in,  first-out (LIFO) methods.  Approximately 17% in 2005 and 15% in 2004 of the inventory cost was computed using the LIFO method.  The differences between LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing these inventories were not material.  (d) In 2005,  these amounts include the impact of our acquisition of General Mills,  Inc.  is 405% ownership interest in SVE for $750 million.  The excess of our purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is $250 million and is included in goodwill.  We also reacquired rights to distribute global brands for $263 million which is included in other nonamortizable intangible assets.
