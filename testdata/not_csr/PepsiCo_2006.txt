years,  your company has led the industry with over 8% top line growth,  double-digit EPS growth and approximately $26 billion in operating cash flow.  During this period,  we have returned approximately $20 billion to you,  our shareholders.  What allows us to deliver these kinds of consistent results? It is an ideal match of PepsiCo people,  capabilities and great brands with opportunity.  Specifically,  this includes our structural advantages,  capability advantages and our unique people culture.  For example:  We sit squarely in the sweet spot of the Food and Beverage space — convenience.   We have a big global reach — with tremendous opportunity for continued growth.   Our go-to-market systems provide us with a mosaic of distribution arms that reach everywhere we operate cost effectively and with great efficiency and speed — ensuring our products are always available.   We have demonstrated that we have the strategic acuity to spot shifting consumer interests,  such as the move to non-carbonated beverages and the increasing focus on health and wellness.   We know how to build a brand is personality and leverage our mega-brands,  not only into line extensions but also into entirely new platforms.   We have a track record of success in acquiring attractive tuck-in businesses and then integrating them quickly and efficiently.   Our people provide an overwhelming advantage.  They are passionate about what they do and pride themselves on results.  Add to this the diversity we cultivate and the personal ownership our associates take in the businessand you have a sense of our unique culture.  We,  and all our associates across the globe,  believe PepsiCo is delivering more than just financial performance.  We are a 
11:41 PM 
company with an increasingly deep sense of awareness of the world around us and the needs of its inhabitants.  We believe this is a company with a heart,  and recognize the role leading companies like ours play in society.  It inspires us to focus on delivering Performance with Purpose — something we intend to continue doing.  
Human Sustainability It is not about growing a business for the next quarter or the next year.  It is about growing a business profitably for the long term.  We believe we can do this in ways directly related to our business,  beginning with our products.  We have a fundamental belief that humans need to be nourished in multiple dimensions — ranging from simple treats to healthier eats.  We call this human sustainability,  and we are continuously transforming our portfolio of products to meet consumer needs.  We have improved the nutritional profiles of our global,  flagship brands by changing to healthier oilsreducing sugar and sodium content,  and by expanding the range of products we offer.  This includes products ranging from indulgences — or treats — to good-for-you products that offer functional benefits like hydration or heart health.  In fact,  our products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles — what we call 'Smart Spot" eligible products — represented over two-thirds of our growth in North America in 2006.  These products meet authoritative nutrition statements set by the National Academy of Sciences and the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration or provide other functional benefits.  And we have set a goal of deriving 50% of all our U.S.  revenues with Smart Spot eligible products by 2010.  We are supplementing our portfolio transformation with efforts to educate consumers about the importance of active lifestyles and nutritional balance.  We have committed to helping them understand that,  along with the calories they put in their bodies,  they must ensure they are burning calories as well.  And we are proactively collaborating with policy makers to help consumers live healthier lives.  In 2006PepsiCo worked with the Clinton Foundation,  the American Heart Association and its partners in the American Beverage Association to develop policies for selling beverages in U.S.  schools,  and followed up with a

 Very Special Thanks In 2007,  we celebrate a lifetime of leadership for a very prominent member of the PepsiCo family.  Earning his place in PepsiCo history as a world-class Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSteve Reinemund is leaving a legacy of growth through his work in transforming our portfolio to address health and wellness consumer needs,  building a diverse and inclusive environment for our people and driving the company is Power of One capabilities.  And as he is done each of these,  he is reinforced a culture committed to driving business results the right way: connected to clearly articulated values.  It was under Steve is leadership that PepsiCo defined our Values,  so we now have a common commitment and understanding of the principles that guide us.  He is been an excellent partner and superb mentoras well as a great friend.  We will all miss him when he steps down as Chairman in May,  along with three other directors who are retiring.  Each has made a lasting contribution to our success.  
Steve Reinemund Steve began his career with PepsiCo in 1984 at Pizza Hutwhich was then part of our restaurant division.  He served as Chief Executive Officer there before going on to lead Frito-Lay North America and then our worldwide snack operations.  He moved to headquarters as PepsiCo is President and Chief Operating Officer in 1999,  and then served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from 2001 to 2006.  During this timehe increased PepsiCo revenues by more than $11 billion,  and net income and earnings per share more than doubled.  In the process,  the annual dividend doubled and the company is market capitalization surpassed $100 billion.  
Board of Directors Retiring this year are three members of the Board of Directors who have been with us a total of 46 years combined: Bob AllenJohn Akers and Frank Thomas.  Bob served on our Board for 17 years,  and since 2000 he has been Presiding Director.  He set a high standard for this critical new role with his firm and steady direction.  John joined our Board 16 years ago and was Chair of our Compensation Committee and a continuous source of sage advice.  Frank provided 13 years of service and was a chief contributor to our business strategies and people planning,  and was an invaluable source of counsel to all of us.  Each of these individuals has provided excellent counsel and perspective and has given us the full value of his experience.  We shall miss them greatly.  We are pleased to have the depth of experience of Sharon Rockefeller,  who will become Presiding Director.  In addition,  we announced in February that Cynthia Trudell left our Board to become PepsiCo is Senior Vice President and Chief Personnel Officer,  a role she has already assumed.  We thank her for her years of service on the Board and look forward to her continued contributions to PepsiCo as she uses her experience to drive our business growth while motivating,  developing and caring for the employees who make our businesses successful.

similar agreement for snacks in U.S.  schools.  In fact,  PepsiCo is the only company to have participated in the development of both policies.  We are introducing health and wellness programs in markets around the world.  And in countries such as Mexicothe United Kingdom and Brazil,  we have established advisory boards to help guide our efforts.  No matter where we are,  the safety and integrity of our products is our single highest priority.  It is our duty as a responsible company.  People buy our brands because they know they can count on consistent quality — every time.  We follow very rigorous standards of safety and quality.  Our standards are equally rigorous in New York,  London and Beijing as they are wherever else we operate.  We stand behind each and every product we sell.  
Environmental Sustainability The second way PepsiCo can give back to the global community it serves is through its work with environmental sustainability.  By fully understanding our environmental impact,  we can find ways to conserve and replenish the planet is natural resources.  In doing what is right for the business,  we can do what is right for the global community.  PepsiCo has focused its environmental sustainability efforts on water,  energy and packaging — areas where we can make the biggest impact.  Reducing waste water,  establishing rainwater collection capabilities,  using more recyclable materials in our packaging and using alternative energy sources are just a few of the priorities we have set for ourselves.  Success with each of them translates into financial benefits for the business.  Our accountability as a global corporate citizen extends to other social issues as well.  We have established programs to help our associates and communities combat HIV/AIDS.  Our associates are volunteering in our communities,  and PepsiCo continually responds to calls for humanitarian aid.  
Talent Sustainability The third area of sustainability that we have chosen to focus on is talent sustainability — reflecting our belief that people hold the key to PepsiCo is success.  Our company is known to many as an academy company,  a place where people grow and business leaders develop.  We are also committed to building a work environment where all of our associates can achieve a better quality of life and know that,  as a businesswe cherish them.  The transitions we announced this year,  starting with the CEO and including several other senior executive roles,  show that we are not only committed to developing and retaining deep bench strength,  but that we are equally passionate about ensuring seamless transitions.  And while we certainly weren't looking for external recognition,  BusinessWeek bestowed its 2006 "smoothest handover" honors to PepsiCo,  saying,  "…the transition in October from Steven S Reinemund to Indra K.  Nooyi at the $33 billion PepsiCo was noticeably angst-free. " Whether it is managing transitions or running the business day-to-day,  PepsiCo is culture is renowned for its 'can-do" spiritsomething we consider part of our DNA.  Look no further than the marketplace challenges of any year to see our level of commitment to getting the job done.  In 2006,  whether it was skyrocketing fruit costs,  or ever-increasing competitive activity in categories or markets across the globe,  our people proved they are among the world is best.  
Our focus on people has never been more critical; the global competition for talent intensifies each year,  and the companies that win will be those that provide the most opportunity for personal and professional growth.  We firmly believe that PepsiCo is commitment to diversity and inclusion is creating that kind of environment.  To attract and retain the best and brightest,  we are working harder than ever to ensure our culture grows in its inclusive nature — that it becomes known as a premier place to work because every associate can bring his or her whole self to work.  When that happens,  we unleash the power of our people on innovative solutions that will grow your company.  Looking ahead,  our work plan is clear: we have a mandate to deliver Performance with Purpose.  We are well positioned to deliver financial performance,  consistent with our guidance,  and to do it with the goals of nourishing consumers,  replenishing the environment in which we operate and cherishing our people.  Our capabilities and strategies to deliver on this priority are highlighted in the pages that follow.  While we have much more to do,  we are making progress on delivering on our commitment to Purpose and are proud to share details with you in this publication.  As a result of our efforts,  the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index — an investment fund comprised of North American companies that excel in managing economic,  environmental and social results — added PepsiCo to its list in 2006.  
Our True North — Our Values Of course,  guiding our people and our culture is a set of values that helps ensure we achieve all results with integrity — the right way.  We want PepsiCo to continue to be viewed as a high-integrity company,  and we recognize and reward leaders who deliver results in ways that are consistent with our True North — our Values.  Since PepsiCo was formed in 1965,  each of the company is leaders — beginning with Don Kendall,  and including Wayne Calloway and Roger Enrico — has been passionately committed to operating a business with integrity,  one that delivers strong,  sustainable financial returns.  As we have co-authored PepsiCo is strategy over the last several years,  and conclude our own CEO transition,  above all we share an equally passionate commitment to our Values and to running a business that does better by doing betterachieving financial results while addressing environmental and social needs.  It is a legacy we both intend to leave.  And we believe there is no better,  more honorable,  or more strategic way to grow your company.

Questions & Answers 
U.S.  Category Leaders 
Our Chairman and President & Chief Executive Officer Perspective 
The questions below reflect key questions shareholders often ask about our businessesand are followed by joint responses from our Chairman,  Steve Reinemund,  and our President and Chief Executive Officer,  Indra Nooyi.  
Q: PepsiCo is product categories and their impact on health continues to capture media,  consumer and regulatory focus.  How is PepsiCo is portfolio faring in this environment? 
A: As the transformation of PepsiCo is portfolio continues,  we are able to add more choices for consumers to meet their needs for products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles,  and we are proud of each and every choice we offer.  Our efforts are galvanized by three imperatives: continue making our fun-foryou products more nutritious,  develop new products that address the needs of the entire food pyramid,  and try to ensure consumers never have to trade off nutrition and taste.  The range of product choices we offer grows each year,  as we develop or acquire new products or platforms that range from indulgent to good-for-you.  At the same timewe are improving the nutritional profiles of our larger,  core brands.  For example,  changing cooking oils to sunflower oil for both Lay is and Ruffles potato chips at FLNA and Walkers crisps in the United Kingdom reduces the saturated fat in these products without sacrificing taste.  And we are working on developing new sweeteners and adding more nutritious ingredients to our products — such as fiber to foods and beverages and omega-3 fatty acids to juices.  Our portfolio of more nutritious choices is working well in this environment,  evidenced by over two-thirds of our North America top line growth in 2006 being driven by products that are PepsiCo Smart Spot eligible — meaning they meet authoritative nutritional statements developed by the National Academy of Sciences or the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration.  
Q: What,  specifically,  is PepsiCo doing to address regulatory pressures relating to health concerns across the globe? 
On the regulatory and policy side,  we are firm believers in engaging a range of public and private experts to come to workable solutions on such things as how and where our products are sold and marketed.  We are actively engaged with policy and thought leaders,  as well as food and beverage industry leaders,  to reach decisions on steps we can 
take to support consumers in their quest for healthier lifestyles.  This includes insights from PepsiCo is Blue Ribbon Advisory Board,  a group of leading health and wellness experts and third-party advisors from across the globe,  as well as our Ethnic Advisory Boards who have provided insights relating to multicultural consumers.  Most recently,  PepsiCo is work in the United States with the Clinton Foundationthe American Heart Association and the beverage industry,  are examples of working proactively to set policies that put the right kinds of products in the right locations — in this case,  schools.  We are working in our international markets in much the same way.  An advantaged portfolio of good- and better-for-you products — products that are Smart Spot eligible — has provided,  and will continue to provide,  growth opportunities at what we call the intersection of business and public interests.  
Q: How are you approaching innovation as a means to growth? 
Carbonated Soft Drinks 
Sports Drink 
PET Water Brand (non-jug) 
Chilled Juices & Juice Drinks 
Innovation demands that we constantly look around the next corner to ensure we are providing products that our consumers and retail customers want.  We have a relentless focus on innovation,  as new products consistently deliver 15% to 20% of our total growth.  In 2006 alone,  our North American businesses introduced new products that totaled greater than $1 billion in retail sales.  More strategically said,  we are focused on game-changing innovation.  Clearly,  we need to keep our existing big brands fresh while developing products and venturing into new categories.  Through a disciplined approach to innovation,  we have developed a very strong pipeline for 2007 and beyond,  including new products like Flat Earth vegetable and fruit crisps from Frito-Lay,  and new beverage entries such as Izze,  a sparkling beverage made with 70% fruit juice,  and Naked Juice,  a line of all natural juices and juice smoothies,  acquired in January 2007.  And we'll expand on our successes,  such as introducing Baked Walkers crisps in the United Kingdom.  As the lifeblood of any successful consumer products company,  we expect innovation will continue to be a key tool for growth at PepsiCo going forward.

Q: How are you addressing rising input costs in your businesses? 
Tortilla Chips 
Structural inflation is a reality we believe will persist over the next few years.  Agricultural commodities,  energy and certain metals are in a period of protracted inflation that is unlikely to moderate until supply catches up.  Fortunately,  over the years we have demonstrated the resilience of the PepsiCo portfolio to navigate through these headwinds successfully.  And we are confident we will find innovative solutions to cover rising input costs.  It will mean pulling all available levers to address inflation,  as we have always donesuch as finding new productivity,  strategically hedging our input costs,  and executing prudent and judicious pricing.  
Q: How are you addressing the carbonated soft drink (CSD) category decline in North America? 
Corn Chips 
Extruded Snack 
Multigrain Snack 
Rejuvenating the CSD category requires us to deliver new products,  new packaging and new benefits to re-engage consumers.  2007 has one of the strongest line-ups of CSD innovation we have had in many years.  In essence,  we plan to build a new category for us of  isparkling" beverages.  Whether it is through Izze sparkling beverages,  our new Jazz line,  increased distribution of Pepsi Max throughout our system,  new 'choreography" packaging for Pepsi,  or other new product and packaging news for Diet Pepsi,  Mountain Dew and Sierra Mistwe believe we have got an impressive lineup ready for the marketplace.  And we are supporting our new products as we continue to support our established core brands.  Looking ahead,  we have increased our investment in truly breakthrough innovations to come,  like new sweeteners that we believe hold the power to restoring CSD category growth.  
Q: You have had good success promoting senior executives from within the company.  What are you doing to ensure you maintain a strong bench and good succession planning? 
We announced a number of senior executive changes this year,  ranging from CEO to senior executive talent of our operating divisions.  Because of the deep bench strengthwe were able to provide opportunities to current PepsiCo executives — ensuring smooth transitions and tapping into literally hundreds of years' worth of experience within the company.  
If anything,  this series of moves underscores the importance of continuously building bench strength in our management group.  We continue to place a high priority on sustaining our pool of executive talent,  and we clearly understand that in the global competition for talent our people planning processes must be world class.  
Q: How will Indra Nooyi is appointment to CEO change PepsiCo is strategic focus or priorities? 
Our transition of the CEO role is as seamless a transition as any PepsiCo has ever done,  largely reflecting the fact that we have co-authored the strategies the company is pursuing.  There are no major new strategies that have been put into place since the transition took effect in October of 2006,  and we continue to aggressively pursue those strategies that have been driving the company is growth.  
Q: How will PepsiCo is work with diversity and inclusion,  and its work with corporate social responsibility and corporate governance evolve under new leadership? 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion as a means to drive our growth remains steadfast.  We continue to see the impact of our efforts in our business results,  as consumer product offerings,  promotions and customer programming benefit from the diverse and inclusive workforce and environment we are building.  Our focus on corporate responsibility has always been strong and will even be stronger as we contribute to societal growth and help address societal problems.  Some would say we have a moral and social obligation.  Others would say it is simply good business.  Either way,  we have a major role to play.  Similarly for corporate governance,  we continue to find ways to strengthen our approach,  our tools and our reporting in the name of transparency for our shareholders and the range of constituents who track our business.  For example,  in 2006,  PepsiCo participated in a pilot program at the SEC to test a new electronic filing system.  These kinds of priorities,  which tie directly to our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship,  will remain front and center.

Q: Where is PepsiCo in its investment in business process transformation,  and specifically its SAP implementation? 
Business Process Transformation (BPT) is a multi-year transformation effort to simplify and synchronize our business processes and tools into one common platform.  In 2006,  we began implementing SAP.  We streamlined our indirect procurement system across our U.S.  divisions,  and for QuakerTropicana and Gatorade,  we also streamlined customer orders,  implemented a more efficient system for assessing and tracking capital expenditures and advertising and marketing spending,  and provided common demand forecasting capability.  The project has an attractive business case including both IT cost savings and operating productivity.  Additionally,  we expect benefits from increased business information.  
Q: International has been a big 
Juice fruit beverages (acquired January 2,  2007).  Each acquisition gives us a new opportunity for growth,  whether through new product categories or greater reach into emerging retail channels.  Internationally,  we completed the acquisitions of Duyvis nuts in the Netherlands and Star Foods snacks in Poland,  as well as Bluebird snacks in New Zealand in early 2007.  Here again,  each provides opportunity for growth through new geographies and new product lines internationally.  Before any acquisition is made,  we apply a disciplined approach to evaluating returns on the investment within a reasonable period and focus on ensuring these businesses add profitable growth to PepsiCo.  We feel very good about these acquisitions,  and their integration is proceeding well.  Going forward,  you can expect us to continue acting on our stated strategy of smaller,  tuck-in acquisitions as a means to help us grow.  
contributor to PepsiCo is growth over the past few years.  How do you plan to sustain this growth? 
Q: What is the next big Power of 
A: PepsiCo International continues to be 
Our Power of One initiatives — those directed at accelerating growth for PepsiCo and our retailers through the power of the entire PepsiCo portfolio — are most definitely moving to a new level.  In 2006,  we conducted 'Innovation Summits" with our customers to share a holistic view of how shopping and eating habits are fragmenting.  Using the insights from these summits,  we have worked with our retail partners and tailored our product offerings — by account — to maximize the potential of our categories and boost performance and results.  But our partnerships with customers go beyond top-line driving initiatives.  We have expanded it to include end-to-end supply chain efficiencies.  We are refreshing our selling and merchandising activities and critically reviewing all touch points with our customers to eliminate inefficiencies like out-of-stocks and reduce 'pain points, " if any.  This initiative extends beyond PepsiCo to include our bottling partners — members of the extended PepsiCo family who work hand in hand with us on all of our initiatives.  
the growth engine for the company — delivering on our expectations to grow at about twice the rate of our North American businesses.  Growth internationally across a wide range of markets is strong.  We believe the strong growth achieved by our PepsiCo International business in 2006 reflects the work of a world-class management team,  years of investment,  and the implementation of a deliberate strategy to create scale in key international markets that will deliver profitable growth.  The portfolio of international markets continues to broaden and strengthen as we deliver exciting new products,  tailored to local tastes,  to consumers in approximately 200 countries.  And in developing and emerging markets in particular,  growth in per capita GDP levels continues to generate increased demand for our products.  
Q: PepsiCo made a number of acquisitions in 2006 — both in North America and internationally.  How is the integration of these businesses going? And what kinds of mergers and acquisitions activity can we expect to see going forward?

Our Capability Advantages Our capability advantages include the strategic acuity necessary to anticipate consumer needs and innovate to fulfill them.  Early on,  we anticipated consumers moving from carbonated soft drinks to non-carbonated beverages,  and we broadened our beverage portfolio to capture new growth in the non-carbonated segment.  Similarly,  we were among the first food and beverage companies to anticipate increased consumer interest in health and wellness and to recognize that we could help consumers live healthier lifestyles.  Along with knowing our customers,  we know our brands and how to build and market them.  Add to this our demonstrated ability to pinpoint,  acquire and integrate businesses — both big and small — and we believe our capability advantages will continue contributing to our strong performance.  We recognized the need to Strategic Acuity — Move broaden our portfolio early to Non-Carbonated on and moved to extend our Beverages presence in non-carbonated Carbonated beverages remain the most popular beverage category,  with some 95% of U.S.  households purchasing them.

Strategic Acuity — Health and Wellness Providing consumers with choices has long been a part of our mindset.  We introduced Diet Pepsi in 1964 and Reduced Fat Ruffles in the mid 80s.  We have historically supported active lifestyles as well.  Throughout the world,  PepsiCo is a frequent sponsor of sports and active lifestyles through our marketing and our charitable donations.  Our increasing commitment to health and wellness is reflected in the transformation of our portfolio,  such as through our acquisitions of Tropicana and Quaker.  That 
Our goal is to make our products available wherever there are hungry or thirsty people.

commitment is behind our creation of a Blue Ribbon Health and Wellness Advisory Board,  a group that provides expert advice on a variety of initiatives including new products,  nutrition news and exercise programs.  And it has driven our work to improve the nutritional profile of our existing product lines.  In 2003,  long before concerns about trans fats became the subject of mainstream mediaPepsiCo removed trans fats from Doritos,  Cheetos and Tostitos in the United States and Canada,  by converting to corn oil — a vegetable oil high in good fats,  mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.  In 2006,  we changed the oils in our Lay is and Ruffles brand potato chips in the United States and internationally in Walkers crisps,  moving to sunflower oil,  which is lower in saturated fat.  
We are pioneers in offering consumers smart choices.  In 2004,  we introduced the Smart Spot symbol in the United States,  a first-of-itskind designation that helps consumers identify PepsiCo products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles.  Products with the Smart Spot symbol meet nutrition criteria based on authoritative statements from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration and the National Academy of Sciences or provide other functional benefits.  More than 40% of our revenues in the United States and Canada come from products that are Smart Spot eligible.  
10:31 PM 
We have a growing portfolio of brands marketed internationally that provide a clear nutrition or health benefit — what we call 'Good for You. " In Mexico,  for example,  we are pioneering new technology to help preserve healthy nutrients in our products.  A current example is a baked potato stick called Nutritaswhich includes vegetables and is produced by microwave cooking,  steaming and slow baking.  We have introduced baked snacks in Mexico and the United Kingdom and will continue to offer more choices across the world.  Throughout 2006,  we continued adding products that fit into healthier lifestyles.  At the start of the year,  we acquired Stacy is Pita Chip Company,  a U.S. -based premium natural-snacks company.  In the water category we introduced SoBe Life Watera line of vitamin-enhanced water beverages.  At Frito-Laywe launched Tostitos Multigrain to bring wholesome grains to one of America is favorite tortilla chip brands,  and we introduced Baked! Cheetos and Doritos snacks in our line of 100-Calorie Mini Bites,  to take the guesswork out of portion control.  We introduced whole grain side dishes as part of our Rice-A-Roni brand.  We are addressing the needs of serious athletes as well,  with research-proven performance beverages like Gatorade Endurance Formula.  And this momentum has continued into 2007,  with the introduction of Gatorade AM Thirst Quencherwith flavors that appeal to morning exercisers.

Brand building is about extending a brand is image.  And we are adept at connecting local preferences to our global brands,  resulting in overall growth.  Take Lay is as an example: we have expanded it worldwidetailoring it to local palates.  We start with the well-known 'banner sun" brand,  and we cultivate the brand across our international markets — capitalizing on iconic names in their own right like Walkers in the United Kingdom,  Sabritas in Mexico,  and Matutano in Spain,  among others.  Then we extend the brand with flavors and seasonings geared to local tastes — chilies in Latin America,  beef and ketchup in Europe,  and prawn in Asia,  for example.  Next,  we branch into entirely new vari ations,  such as Lay is Artesanas and Lay is Mediterraneas made with olive oil.  We offer different kinds of chips,  like hard-bite kettle style chips and,  more recently,  natural and organic varieties.  We apply the same process to our other snack and beverage brands.  The room for growth is huge.  Recent examples of our brand building prowess from our beverage portfolio include our 2006 U.S.  introduction of Jazz from Diet Pepsi,  a low-calorie,  indulgent cola available in two flavors: Black Cherry French Vanilla and Strawberries & Cream.  We launched Pepsi Limón in Peru,  and in Argentina we introduce 7UP H2OH!,  a drink that bridges carbonated water drinks with flavored water.

Through our North American Coffee Partnership with Starbucks,  we introduced Starbucks Iced Coffee as well as Strawberries and Crème Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot Light.  Creating new products is not the only way we build brands.  We are experts at capturing consumer attention with our brands.  In 2006,  we solidified Pepsi is popularity among music fans when Grammy award-winning artist Mariah Carey wrote and recorded original ringtones for the Pepsi Cool Tones and Motorola Phones promotion.  In international markets,  a Pepsi advertising campaign included an engaging theme song called 'DaDaDa" that caught on by connecting soccer fans around the world.  We give our brands special attention.  For example,  in 2006 we unveiled new packaging and a new logo for Doritos tortilla chips to communicate the brand is powerful crunch

Similarly,  we kicked off the biggest marketing campaign for Cheetos in the brand is history.  And keep your eyes on Fritos corn chips as we celebrate the brand is 75th anniversary in 2007 with special retro packaging.  
Mergers and Acquisitions Our people have the skills to pinpoint,  acquire and seamlessly integrate businesses — big and small.  This has enabled us to successfully add large companies,  like Quaker and Tropicana,  and regularly add smaller 'tuck-in" deals that enhance and expand our existing operations.  These include our recent acquisitions of Izze Beverage Co.,  Naked Juice,  and Stacy is Pita Chip Company in the United States,  as well as Star Foods 
in Poland,  Bluebird Foods in New Zealand and Duyvis nuts in the Netherlands and Belgium.  We are disciplined buyerswith a rigorous process for due diligence to ensure that any potential acquisition makes complete sense from both a business and culture standpoint.  As diligent integrators,  we have a special understanding of the entrepreneurial nature of smaller 'tuck-in" acquisitions and exercise a thoughtful approach to helping these new businesses preserve and build upon their unique capabilities,  such as the high level of involvement Stacy is has with its consumers.  We not only sign the deals,  but we are committed to making them work.

Purpose Today is consumers increasingly view their spending decisions as a way to make a difference in the world.  They want to see their values reflected in the products they buy and their communities strengthened by the businesses they support.  At PepsiCo,  we believe we are in a perfect position to meet these needs.  We strive to do better by doing better.  In delivering on this commitment,  we have identified three areas where we believe we can have the most impact: human sustainability,  environmental sustainability and talent sustainability.  
Human Sustainability People need to be nourished in many ways,  ranging from what they eat to how they live.  We call this human sustainability,  and the areas where we can make the greatest difference are through the products we offer consumers and through our efforts to encourage consumers to adopt more active lifestyles.  As we pursue these priorities,  we tap into the deep expertise and counsel of our Blue Ribbon Health and Wellness Advisory Board,  established to help us address health and wellness opportunities.  
Products In the United States,  our Smart Spot symbol makes it easier for consumers to identify our products that are nutritiouscan contribute fiber,  vitamins or other important nutrientsor are reduced in fat,  sugar or sodium.  Products with the Smart Spot symbol meet nutrition criteria based on authoritative statements from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration and the National Academy of Sciences or provide other functional benefits.  Today,  more than 250 of our products carry the Smart Spot symbol.  On the front panel of the product packaging 
consumers see the green Smart Spot symbol that says 'Smart Choices Made Easy. " And on the back of the packaging we describe what makes each product a better choice.  As new technologies and ingredients become availablewe are committed to making our core products better choices.  For example,  Frito-Lay North America is Ruffles and Lay is potato chips and Walkers United Kingdom is snacks reduced the saturated fat in their leading potato crisp and chip brands by switching to sunflower oil,  which delivers improved nutrition without sacrificing taste.  
The PepsiCo Smart Spot symbol helps consumers select products such as Baked! Cheetos,  which are lower in calories.  
Active Lifestyles We are committed to helping consumers fight obesity and live healthier lives by supporting programs that help them engage in more active lifestyles.  Among the programs we are proud to sponsor is America On the Move (AOM),  a national effort in the United States dedicated to helping individuals,  families and communities make positive changes in their health and quality of life.  AOM recommends making small changessuch as walking 2000 more steps and consuming 100 fewer calories per day,  as a way for consumers to incorporate healthy habits into their everyday lives and avoid weight gain.  The African American and Latino communities face some of the greatest health risks.  That is why in partnership with the National Urban League and the National Council of La Razawe are using the messages and methods of AOM to promote healthier living among these constituencies.  We believe it is important to develop the habit of exercising early in life so we have many programs for young people.  In the United States,  our alliance with the YMCA,  the largest provider of fitness programs,  is expected to reach more than 
Our Mission We aspire to make PepsiCo the world is premier consumer products company,  focused on convenient foods and beverages.  We seek to produce healthy financial rewards for investors as we provide opportunities for growth and enrichment to our employeesour business partners and the communities in which we operate.  And in everything we do,  we strive to act with honesty,  openness,  fairness and integrity.  
nine million youths.  We have programs on the local level as well.  For example,  in Chicago through the Chicago Communities in Schools and the Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children (CLOCC) we are collaborating on an effort to pilot,  test and deliver a health promotion program in six Chicago communities and schools.  Outside the United Stateswe support initiatives such as the Gatorade Schools program in Brazil,  which encourages good nutrition and physical activity.  In Mexico,  we support a program to construct recreational areas in indigenous shelters in order to promote sports in these communities.  
School Programs We recognize the critical importance of helping children learn to make healthy food choices.  In 2006,  PepsiCo was the only company to be part of two historic agreements — one for beverages and one for snacks — to provide schools in the United States with products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles.  Through our partnership with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation — a joint initiative of the William J.  Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association — we will offer U.S.  schools products that meet specific nutritional guidelines.  Under the beverage guidelines,  we no longer will offer full-calorie soft drinks,  juice drinks or teas in any K-12 schools,  and we'll limit the calories and portion sizes of beveragesincluding sports drinks and juices.  On the snacks sidewe helped set the first-ever voluntary guidelines for what will be offered in U.S.  schools.  Both agreements represent a 
12:15 AM 
breakthrough step to adopt a practical policy for snackfood and beverage offerings in U.S.  schools.  
Marketing We have begun to enlist our products in promoting key issues.  Through the North American Coffee Partnershipour joint venture with Starbucks Coffee Companywe entered into an agreement to increase distribution of Ethos Water to retail stores in the United States.  For each bottle of Ethos Water that is sold,  a $005 donation is made to help children and their communities around the world get access to clean drinking water.  Frito-Lay is SunChips brand sponsored the Komen Race for the Cure National Volunteer Recognition Program in the United States.  The partnership included SunChips' 'Crunch for the Cure" pink bags,  with part of the proceeds going to the Susan G.  Komen Breast Cancer Foundation to support the fight against breast cancer.  
Through our North American Coffee Partnership,  our joint venture with Starbucks,  PepsiCo is working to increase distribution of Ethos Water,  which will donate $005 for every bottle sold to help children around the world get clean drinking water.  18 
Environmental Sustainability Environmental sustainability means replenishing resources we use — on our planet and in the communities we serve.  We have defined our focus areas to be water,  packaging and energy.  In our communities we are supporting the fight against HIV/AIDS as well as other philanthropic and volunteer activities.  
Water Our water program goals begin with making sure our practices are responsible.  We work closely with governmentsmunicipalities and technical experts when locating our facilities to ensure adequate quantity and quality of water supply.  We have programs to reduce our use of water and reuse water whenever possible.  Gatorade,  for example,  is reducing its water use by installing waterless rinsing systems to clean its bottles.  We are focused on finding new opportunities to save water.  For example,  across Frito-Lay North America our water conservation initiatives have reduced the quantity of water used in processing snack chips by more than onethird since 1999.  Where water shortages are an issue,  we recognize our responsibility to help make 
sure the communities in which we operate have access to sufficient water.  For example,  in India,  PepsiCo is supporting The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to help improve water processes and management.  These projects include an evaluation of water resources and preparation of area-wide management plans,  including the rejuvenation of traditional water systems.  The PepsiCo Foundation is working with the China Women is Development Foundation on a research initiative to expand availability of safe drinking water for the people of Western and Central China.  PepsiCo China is work with the Mothers' Water Cellar Project has already brought water to thousands of families in remote locations by building water storage wells and the capability to harvest rainwater.

Programs with the National Council of La Raza and the National Urban League encourage physical activity and healthier eating and address health concerns of African American and Latino consumers.  
Our Ethos Water distribution agreement has a goal of contributing at least $10 million by the end of 2010 to help children and their communities around the world get clean drinking water.  Our support of The Safe Water Network,  a not-for-profit organization we helped establish,  is focused on developing and deploying new affordable water purification technology to provide safe water to communities in need.  We also share our water expertise.  In India,  for examplewe have shown farmers techniques that save water by directly seeding rice paddiesrather than growing the rice through highly water-intensive conventional seeding.  
We begin with our operations.  For example,  in the United States today a 20-ounce Gatorade Thirst Quencher bottle weighs 10% less and uses 70% less packaging to deliver the product than the same size bottle sold in 1998.  Tropicana re-engineered the way it delivers apple juice concentrate in the United States.  Its move to recyclable 'flexi" bags eliminated nearly 43000 steel drums annually.  
Selected 2006 Environmental Honors For decades,  our snack food operations have recovered starch released in the potato chip making process.  In 2006our United Kingdom snack food operation received government approval for a process that creates foodgrade level starch,  much of which can be used in our own products.  Recycling is a way of life at PepsiCo.  The Frito-Lay directstore-delivery system enables our associates to recover delivery cartons after use.  A typical carton makes about six trips,  eliminating some 60 billion pounds of solid waste a year.  We helped found the National Recycling Partnershipan initiative to increase recycling across the United States.  And we have supported Keep America Beautiful is (KAB) Great American Cleanup,  the nation is largest voluntary clean-up program,  since its inception.  In 2006,  Pepsi-Cola North America partnered with Sam is Club and KAB in an innovative program called 'Return the Warmth. " KAB helped 
  PepsiCo: Vision for America Award from Keep America Beautiful.    Frito-Lay North America: Energy Star Partner of the Year from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE).    Frito-Lay San Antonio,  Texas: WaterSaver Award.    Frito-Lay California: Bakersfield and Modesto facilities won the state WRAP award for outstanding performance in reducing solid waste.  
communities recycle more than 36 million beverage bottles.  Sam is Clubs provided school grants,  as well as fleece jackets made with recycled plastic,  for needy children in the area.  Helping to reduce waste is just as important in our markets outside the United States.  In India,  for examplewe convert packaging film waste to boards,  building and furniture material.  
Energy 
Packaging We are committed to reducingreusing and recycling our packaging and waste.  To help us achieve our goals,  we have established a Sustainable Packaging Team.  Its objectives include developing alternative packaging material technologies and supporting responsible disposal practices.  
  PepsiCo China: four awards for Mothers' Water Cellar Project.  
 Pepsi-Cola North America program with Keep America Beautiful and Sam is Club encouraged recycling by providing grants to schools that recycled the most beverage containers and donating fleece jackets made with recycled plastic to needy children in the community.  
In 2006,  Frito-Lay was recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S.  Department of Energy (DOE) for energy conservation.  The EPA and DOE conferred Partner-of-The-Year in Energy Management to Frito-Lay North America for its voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency.  At Tropicana we reduced our electricity demand by eliminating some refrigeration 
and instead storing juice blends in aseptic tanks at above freezing temperatures.  The operation also co-generates power and heat to meet most of our on-site electricity needs.  Three of our Gatorade plants capture and reuse biogas,  a by-product of water treatment operations,  as boiler fuel.  One way we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions is by using alternative power

more and more.  For examplein Cupar,  Scotland,  our Quaker oat mill is using electricity from 100% renewable sources.  And at our Frito-Lay plant in Modesto,  California,  we are building a production line in which nearly three-quarters of the heat needed to produce SunChips brand multigrain snacks will come from solar thermal energy.  Our focus extends to the pages you are reading.  This 
annual report was made with recycled paper and 'Green Power, " which means that the power used in the creation of some of the paper was not from fossil fuel.  
HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS poses a major threat in many places where we operate,  especially in high risk countries such as South Africa,  India,  Russia,  China and Thailand.  Our global HIV/AIDS policy provides a template to help fight the pandemic,  and our associates have joined in the fight.  For example,  in South Africa our Simba associates serve as Peer Educators in the community.

Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  The level of bottler funding is at our discretion because these incentives are not required by the terms of our bottling contracts.  
Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  Retail consolidation continues to increase the importance of major customers.  In 2006,  sales to Wal-Mart represented approximately 9% of our total net revenue; and our top five retail customers represented approximately 26% of our 2006 North American net revenue,  with Wal-Mart representing approximately 13%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold 
by them to these retailers.  In additionsales to The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) represented approximately 10% of our total net revenue.  See 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 for more information on our anchor bottlers.  
Our Related Party Bottlers We have ownership interests in certain of our bottlers.  Our ownership is less than 50%,  and since we do not control these bottlers,  we do not consolidate their results.  We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of economic ownership in our income statement as bottling equity income.  We have designated three related party bottlers,  PBGPepsiAmericas,  Inc.  (PAS) and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (PBV),  as our anchor bottlers.  Our anchor bottlers distribute approximately 60% of our North American beverage volume and approximately 18% of our international beverage volume.  Our anchor bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above.  Approximately 8% of our total 2006 sales incentives are related to these bottlers.  See Note 8 for additional information on these related parties and related party commitments and guarantees.

Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery,  brokerwarehouse and foodservice and vending distribution networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needs,  product characteristics and local trade practices.  
bottlers.  Direct-store-delivery enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  Direct-store-delivery is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable We,  our bottlers and our distributors operate direct-store-delivery systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our 
have lower turnover,  and are less likely to be impulse purchases.  
Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks,  foods and beverages to third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  Our foodservice and vending sales force also distributes certain beverages through our bottlers.  This distribution system supplies our products to schoolsbusinesses,  stadiums,  restaurants and similar locations.  
Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against global,  regional,  local and private label manufacturers on the basis of pricequality,  product variety and distribution.  In measured channels,  our chief beverage competitor,  The Coca-Cola Company,  has a slightly larger share of carbonated soft drink (CSD) consumption in the U.S.,  while we have a larger share of chilled juices and isotonics.  In addition,  The Coca-Cola Company maintains a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside North 
America.  Further,  our snack brands hold significant leadership positions in the

Our snack brands face local and regional competi tors,  as well as national and global snack competitors,  and compete on issues related to price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products and the introduction of new products.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketing,  coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network,  allow us to compete effectively.  
Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations.  Our 
transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our employees serve on the boards of our 
anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental compensation for their Board services.

Our Business Risks We are subject to risks in the normal course of business due to adverse developments with respect to: 
 product demand our reputation information technology supply chain retail consolidation,  the loss of major customers and failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners global,  economic,  environmental and political conditions the regulatory environment workforce retention and outsourcing raw materials and other supplies competition,  and  market risks.

Any of these changes may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase our products.  Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovationincluding maintaining a robust pipeline of new products,  and the effectiveness 
advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  Our failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands,  as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  
Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  If we fail to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety

issues,  could also jeopardize our reputation.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  
If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  our business could suffer.  We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers,  as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of customers,  business disruptions,  or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We have embarked on a multi-year Business Process Transformation (BPT) initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application,  as well as the migration to common business processes across our operations.  There can be no certainty that these programs will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the application on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue.  Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information,  corrupting 
information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.  
Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability and that of our suppliersbusiness partners,  including bottlerscontract manufacturers,  independent distributors and retailers,  to makemove and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather,  natural disaster,  fire or explosion,  terrorismpandemics such as avian flu,  strikes or other reasons,  could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occur,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  
Trade consolidation,  the loss of any key customer,  or failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners could adversely affect our financial performance.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customersincluding our retailers and bottling partners,  to effectively compete.  There is a greater concentration of our customer base around the world generally due to the continued consolidation of retail trade.  As retail ownership becomes more concentrated,  retailers demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  as larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-tomarket systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to these trends or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing 
programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  Retail consolidation continues to increase the importance of major customers.  Sales to Wal-Mart represent approximately 9% of our total net revenue; and our top five retail customers currently represent approximately 26%

These percentages include concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  Loss of any of our key customers,  including WalMart,  could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore,  if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottlers through a combination of advertising and marketing support,  they may take actions thatwhile maximizing their own short-term profit,  may be detrimental to us or our brands.  Such actions could have an adverse effect on our profitability.  See 'Our Customers, " 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customersincluding our anchor bottlers.  
4:08 PM 
Our business may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic or environmental conditions or political or other developments and risks in the countries in which we operate.  Unfavorable global economic or environmental changes,  political conditions or other developments may result in business disruption,  supply constraintsforeign currency devaluation,  inflationdeflation or decreased demand.  Unstable economic and political conditions or civil unrest in the countries in which we operate could have adverse impacts on our business results or financial condition.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  accounted for 41% and 36% of our net revenue and operating profitrespectively,  for the year ended December 30,  2006.  Our continued success depends on our ability to broaden and strengthen our presence in emerging markets,  such as Brazil,  Russia,  India and China,  and to create scale in key international markets.  
Regulatory decisions and changes in the legal and regulatory environment could increase our costs and liabilities or limit our business activities.  The conduct of our businesses,  and the production,  distribution,  sale,  advertising,  labeling,  safety,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate.  These laws and regulations may changesometimes dramatically,  as a result of political,  economic or social events.  Such regulatory environment changes include changes in food and drug lawslaws related to advertising and deceptive marketing practices,  accounting standards,  taxation requirements,  competition laws and environmental lawsincluding laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment.  Changes in laws,  regulations or governmental policy and the related 
interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business andtherefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  In particular,  governmental bodies in jurisdictions where we operate may impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  For example,  Proposition 65 in California requires that a warning be given for any product that exposes consumers to a substance listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  If we were required to label any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in California under Proposition 65 ating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees,  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  In addition,  we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functionssuch as payroll processing and benefit plan administration,  to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform effectively we may not be able Our operations outside of the U.S.  to achieve the expected cost accounted for 41% and 36% of our net savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct revenue and operating profiterrors made by such service respectively,  for the year ended providers.

Our operare exposed to the market risks arising 
4:08 PM 
from adverse changes in commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy.  The raw materials and energy which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand,  weather conditions,  agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costs,  we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating income.  Our profitability may also be adversely impacted due to water scarcity and regulation.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world.  As demand for water continues to increase,  we and our business part Page 34 
ners may face disruption of supply or increased costs to obtain the water needed to produce our products.  
Our business could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.  Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against global,  regional and private label manufacturers on the basis of pricequality,  product variety and effective distribution.  Increased competition and anticipated actions by our competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in our market share,  either of which could adversely affect our results.  See 'Our Competition" for more information about our competitors.  
Market Risks We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in: 
 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange rates interest rates stock prices,  and  discount rates affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.  
In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are des34 
ignated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes,  and we limit our exposure to individual counterparties to manage credit risk.  The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 for fur Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements We discuss expectations regarding our future performance,  such as our business outlook,  in our annual and quarterly reports,  press releases,  and other written and oral statements.  These 'forward-looking statements" are based on currently available competitive,  financial and economic data and our operating plans.  They are inherently uncertain,  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations.  We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  The above discussion of risks is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and future results.  
ther discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to stock prices and discount rates.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  
Commodity Prices Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $55 million at December 30,  2006 and $89 million at December 31,  2005.  The open derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of less than $1 million at December 30,  2006 and $39 million at December 31,  2005.  We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have reduced our unrealized gains on open contracts to $2 million of unrealized losses in 2006 and $35 million of unrealized gains in 2005.  
10:20 PM 
Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $196 million at December 30,  2006 and $129 million at December 31,  2005.  The open derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net losses of $28 million in 2006 and $3 million in 2005.  We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have increased our net losses on open contracts to $31 million in 2006 and $4 million in 2005.  We expect to be able to continue to reduce the impact of increases in our raw material and energy costs through our hedging strategies and ongoing productivity initiatives.  
Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate approximately 40% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  the United Kingdom and Canada comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks,  including unforeseen economic changes and political unrest.  During 2006,  net favorable foreign currency,  primarily due to appreciation in the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
contributed almost 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  Currency declines which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  We 
may enter into derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $10 billion at December 30,  2006 and $11 billion at December 31,  2005.  The contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of $6 million at December 302006 and $9 million at December 312005.  We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have resulted in unrealized losses of $86 million in 2006 and $81 million in 2005.  The contracts not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting resulted in net losses of $10 million in 2006 and net gains of $14 million in 2005.  All losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net impact on earnings.  
Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our counterparty credit risk is considered low because these swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  Assuming year-end 2006 and 2005 variable rate debt and investment levels,  a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased net interest expense by $10 million in 2006 and $8 million in 2005.  
Stock Prices A portion of our deferred compensation liability is tied to certain market indices and our stock price.  We manage these market risks with mutual fund 
investments and prepaid forward contracts for the purchase of our stock.  The combined gains or losses on these investments are substantially offset by changes in our deferred compensation liability.  
Our Approach to Managing Risks The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives will necessarily involve taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritizemanage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes:  the PepsiCo Executive Risk Council (PERC),  comprised of a crossfunctional,  geographically diversesenior management group which identifies,  assesses,  prioritizes and addresses strategic and reputational risks;  Division Risk Committees (DRCs)comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet regularly each year to identify,  assessprioritize and address division-specific operating risks;  PepsiCo is Risk Management Officewhich manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PERC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties,  as well as to PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors; and  PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which confirms the ongoing effectiveness of the risk management framework through periodic audit and review procedures.  In 2006,  we continued to focus our mitigation efforts where it was determined that actions were necessary and appropriate to further reduce PepsiCo is exposure to risks,  integrating those efforts in our businesses' operating plans and budgets,  where accountabil 35

ity is assigned and performance measured.  Some highlights include:  To address certain risks related to the demand for our products,  such as consumer health concerns about product attributes and ingredientswe continued to focus on the development of products that respond to consumer trends,  including formulating products to lower sugar,  fats,  and sodium and adding ingredients and new products that can deliver nutritional benefits.  For example,  at FLNA we introduced a new portion control line of 100-calorie offerings,  and we also switched to NuSun sunflower oilan oil containing 90% mono- and polyunsaturated fats and less saturated fat than most other cooking oils,  for our Lay is and Ruffles potato chips.  Internationally,  we reduced the amount of saturated fats in our Walkers crisps in the United Kingdom by 70% and the amount of salt by 25%.  Beyond providing more nutritious product choices,  and in an effort to help address the growing concerns regarding childhood obesity trends in the U.S.,  we joined with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation — a joint initiative of the William J.  Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association — to set voluntary beverage guidelines for U.S.  schools that limit portion sizes and establish voluntary guidelines for snacks and side items in U.S.  schools.   To help ensure that we maintain our reputation for providing safe convenient foods and beverages,  we enhanced the coordination of our division-led product integrity efforts through the PepsiCo Product Integrity Council (PPIC),  a cross-functional forum to share leading practices and confer about areas of potential risk.  Through the PPIC,  we completed a third-party review of our food safety and food security programs which helped identify opportunities to better leverage internal best practices across all of our businesses.  Furthermore,  we enhanced our product sampling and testing protocols.   We continued to enhance our information technology infrastructure and 36 
application systems by upgrading our networks and updating or retiring older infrastructure and systems.  We signed a multi-year managed services contract to consolidate PI is technology infrastructure into three data centers and another multi-year services contract to provide and manage PI is data network.  The data center services will provide full system and data protection and backup and recovery capabilities,  and the data network services will enhance security and provide 24x7x365 monitoring and response capabilities.  We expect to fully implement both of these service contracts over the next three years.  
We continued to focus on leveraging diversity and inclusion,  ensuring we have the talent base necessary to lead our growing businesses.  
 With respect to our BPT initiative,  we continue to build on our learnings and incorporate these into the metrics used to monitor the project.  Specific actions taken this year include revising the overall project structure,  project resources and timelines.  We also continue to invest in process and control resources to build a more automated control environment that remains compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   To address supply chain risks,  we continued to assess our capability to mitigate potential business disruptions and increased the coordination of our efforts across IT disaster recovery,  crisis management and business continuity.  Having recognized the potentially significant impact of a pandemic such as avian influenza on our employees and our business,  we formed a cross-functional,  cross-divisional Pandemic Planning Team that worked to develop strategies and tactics to mitigate that impact.   Against a challenging trade environment,  we continued to work to ensure consistent and equitable trade 
practices across our customers,  to deliver value-added product innovation and differentiation,  to achieve the most effective trade spend across customers and channels through productivity programs,  and to more effectively communicate to our customers the economic advantages of our direct-store-delivery (DSD) system.   To address risks relating to legal and regulatory issues,  we have launched an enhanced PepsiCo Code of Conduct training program in multiple languages.  We also improved the functionality of our employee hotline to better enable reporting of compliance and ethics concerns and enhanced our process for handling reported incidents and ensuring appropriate corrective action.  Furthermore,  we completed environmental and health & safety audits that will help focus our mitigation efforts in these areas going forward.   As part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a talented workforce,  we continued to focus on leveraging diversity and inclusion,  designing the right organizational model to meet our business needs and ensuring we have the talent base necessary to lead our growing businesses.  Tactically,  we worked to expand the breadth and depth of our succession plans and reinforced our focus on managing our people through an increased emphasis on people development as part of our performance management process.   To manage our risks related to raw materials,  we continued to reduce our input cost volatility across our total portfolio by employing various hedging strategies where appropriate and as market opportunities arose.  We also continued to utilize our scale to achieve maximum value across our commodity portfolio and to ensure adequate supply.  In addition,  we have developed strategic global supplier solutions to help minimize volatility.

Our Critical Accounting Policies An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is Our critical accounting policies arise in necessary to understand our financial results.  These conjunction with the following: policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties revenue recognitionand as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact  brand and goodwill valuationsour financial results.  The precision of these estimates and  income tax expense and accrualsthe likelihood of future changes depend on a number of  stock-based compensation expense,  and underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension plans,  our critical  pension and retiree medical plans.  accounting policies do not involve the choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  In connection with our ongoing BPT initiative,  we aligned certain accounting policies across our divisions in 2005.  We conformed our methodology for calculating our bad debt reserves and modified our policy for recognizing revenue for products shipped to customers by third–party carriers.  Additionally,  we conformed our method of accounting for certain costs,  primarily warehouse and freight.  These changes reduced our net revenue by $36 million and our operating profit by $60 million in 2005.  
Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally,  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarlyour policy for warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our historical experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for the products they distribute.  
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In additionDSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  customer inventory levels are monitored.  
Our credit terms typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally.  As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $101 billion in 
2006,  $89 billion in 2005 and $78 billion in 2004.  Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalfsuch as payments for in-store displayspayments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targetsand accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncer 37

tain long-term estimates.  For interim reporting,  we estimate total annual sales incentives for most of our programs and record a pro rata share in proportion to revenue.  Certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rightsmay extend beyond one year.  The costs incurred to obtain incentive arrangements are recognized over no longer 
than the contract period as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $297 million at year-end 2006 and $321 million at year-end 2005 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts.  In 2005,  our 
method of determining the reserves was conformed across our divisions in connection with our BPT initiative,  as discussed above.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  
Brand and Goodwill Valuations We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands and goodwill in acquisitions.  Upon acquisition,  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities,  including brands,  based on estimated fair valuewith any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has significant market share in a stable macroeconomic environment and a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful liveswhich generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factorsincluding the competitive environmentmarket share,  brand history and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Perpetual brands and goodwillincluding the goodwill that is part of our noncontrolled bottling investment balances,  are not amortized.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined 
by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair 
We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  
value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeco nomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair valuewhich is based on its discounted future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations,  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  As of December 30,  2006,  we had $58 billion of perpetual brands and goodwill,  of which approximately 65% related to Tropicana and Walkers.

Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  See Note 5 for additional information regarding our tax reserves.  An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax benefits from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items.  In 2006,  we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $602 million (the '2006 Tax Adjustments"),  substantially all of which related to the Internal Revenue Service is (IRS) examination of our consolidated income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  The IRS issued a Revenue Agent is Report (RAR),  and we are in agreement with their conclusion,  except for one matter which we continue to dispute.  The agreed adjustments relate to transfer pricing and various other transactions,  including certain acquisitions,  the public offering 
of PBG,  as well as the restructuring of our international snack foods operations during that audit period.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanentsuch as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that tax jurisdiction.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) created a one-time incentive for U.S.  corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction.  In 2005,  we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely rein vested outside the U.S.  and recorded income tax expense of $460 million related to this repatriation.  Other than the earnings repatriated,  we intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future andtherefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  At December 30,  2006,  we had approximately $108 billion of undistributed international earnings.  In 2006,  our annual tax rate was 193% compared to 361% in 2005 as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2006 decreased 168 percentage points primarily reflecting the 2006 Tax Adjustments,  the absence of the 2005 AJCA tax charge and the resolution of certain state income tax audits in the current year.  In 2007,  our annual tax rate is expected to be 277%,  primarily reflecting the absence of the 2006 Tax Adjustments.

Stock–Based Compensation Expense We believe that we will achieve our best results if our employees act and are rewarded as business owners.  Therefore,  we believe stock ownership and stock-based incentive awards are the best way to align the interests of employees with those of our shareholders.  A majority of our employees participate in our stock-based compensation programs.  Stock option grants are made at the current stock pricemeaning each employee is exercise price is equivalent to our stock price on the date of grant.  Employees must generally provide three additional years of service to earn the grant,  referred to as the vesting period.  Our options generally have a 10-year term,  which means our employees would have up to seven years after the vesting period to elect to pay the exercise price to purchase one share of our stock for each option exercised.  Employees benefit from stock options to the extent our stock price appreciates above the exercise price after vesting and during the term of the grant.  There have been no reductions to the exercise price of previously issued awards,  and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.  Executives who are awarded longterm incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs).  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs.  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting periodgenerally three years.  Each RSU is settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.  Vesting of RSU awards 
for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets.  We also continued,  as we have since 1989,  to grant an annual award of stock options to all eligible employees,  based on job level or classification,  under our broad-based stock option programSharePower.  SharePower awards generally have a 10-year term and vest over three years.  
Method of Accounting We account for our employee stock options,  which include grants under our executive program and broadbased SharePower program,  under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  All stock grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period.  
recognized in excess of tax benefits previously established upon grant are reported as a financing cash inflow.  Prior to adoption,  such excess tax benefits were reported as an operating cash inflow.  Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2006 was approximately 28% to FLNA,  19% to PBNA,  32% to PI4% to QFNA and 17% to corporate unallocated expenses.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our Black-Scholes assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  
On January 1,  2006,  we adopted SFAS 123RShare-Based Payment.  Since we had previously accounted for our stock-based compensation under the fair value method,  our adoption did not significantly impact our financial position or our results of operations.  
On January 1,  2006,  we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  under the modified prospective method.

Our Assumptions Our Black-Scholes model estimates the expected value our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions,  such as interest rates,  employee exercises,  our stock price and dividend yield.  Our weightedaverage fair value assumptions include: Estimated 2007 Expected life Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
2007 Estimated Expense and Sensitivity of Assumptions Our stock-based compensation expense,  including RSUs,  is as follows: Stock-based compensation expense 
If we assumed a 100-basis-point change in the following assumptions,  our estimated 2007 stock-based compensation expense would increase/(decrease) as follows: 100-Basis-Point Increase 100-Basis-Point Decrease Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
The expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest ratevolatility and dividend yield must be applied.  The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.  Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net incomeshare repurchases and stock price.  
If the expected life were assumed to be one year longer,  our estimated 2007 stock-based compensation expense would increase by $7 million.  If the expected life were assumed to be one year shorter,  our estimated 2007 stockbased compensation expense would decrease by $8 million.  As noted,  changing the assumed expected life impacts all of the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions as the risk free interest rate,  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are estimated over the expected life.

Pension and Retiree Medical Plans assumptions to estimate the amount of Our pension plans cover full-time the benefits that employees earn while employees in the U.S.  and certain interworking,  as well as the present value of national employees.  Benefits are those benefits.

At each measurement date,  the disOur Assumptions count rate is based on interest rates for The determination of pension and high-quality,  long-term corporate debt retiree medical plan obligations and securities with maturities comparable to related expenses requires the use of those of our liabilities.  In the U.S.,  we 
use the Moody is Aa Corporate Index yield and adjust for differences between the average duration of the bonds in this Index and the average duration of our benefit liabilities,  based upon a published index.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience,  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for longterm rates of return.  Our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is established based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk,  and cash requirements for benefit payments.  We use a third-party advisor to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long-term rate of return assumptions.  Our current investment allocation target for our U.S.  plans is 60% in equity securities,  with the balance in fixed income securities.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%,  reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 93% from equity securities and 58% from fixed income securities.  We use a market-related value method that recognizes each year is asset gain or loss over a five-year period.  Therefore,  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the other gains and losses calculation described below.  Other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions are also determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of those employees expected to benefitwhich is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 13 years for retiree medical.

Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expenses are as follows: Pension Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Expected rate of salary increases Retiree medical Expense discount rate Current health care cost trend rate 
would increase pension expense.  The estimated impact of a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on 2007 pension expense is an increase of approximately $37 million.  The estimated impact on 2007 pension expense of a 25-basis-point decrease in the expected rate of return is an increase of approximately $16 million.  See Note 7 regarding the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  
Future Funding Future Expense The estimated changes in pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2006 expense Increase in discount rate (Decrease)/Increase in experience loss amortization Impact of contributions Other 2007 estimated expense 
Pension and retiree medical service costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate but including the effect of demographic assumption changes,  as well as the effects of gains and losses due to demographics,  are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate,  for retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension plans,  measured at a fixed discount rate,  and the effect of changes in discount rates,  gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006,  the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.  108,  Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108),  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements.  SAB 108 requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures.  On December 30,  2006,  we adopted SAB 108.  Our adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our financial statements.  
Based on our current assumptionswhich reflect our prior experience,  current plan provisions and expectations for future experience,  we expect our pension expense to decrease slightly in 2008declining to approximately $360 million by 2012 as unrealized losses are amortized.  If our assumptions and our plan provisions for retiree medical costs remain unchanged and our experience mirrors these assumptions,  we expect our annual retiree medical expense beyond 2007 to approximate $130 million.  
Sensitivity of Assumptions 
We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions,  and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently deductible.  Our pension contributions for 2006 were $59 million,  all of which were non-discretionary.  In 2007,  we expect to make contributions of up to $150 million with up to $75 million expected to be discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be approximately $85 million in 2007.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7.  
 decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions In July 2006,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No.  48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No.  109 (FIN 48),  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.  FIN 48 requires that we recognize in our financial statements,  the impact of a tax position,  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on auditbased on the technical merits of the position.  The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year,  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting prin ciple recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.  We do not expect our adoption of FIN 48 to materially impact our financial statements.  In September 2006,  the FASB issued SFAS 157,  Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157),  which defines fair valueestablishes a framework for measuring fair value,  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial statements.

2005 Restructuring Charges 
In 2005,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each Decemberresulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  
In 2005,  we incurred restructuring charges of $83 million to reduce costs in our operations,  principally through headcount reductions.  
2006 Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
In 2006,  we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $602 million,  substantially all of which related to the IRS is examination of our consolidated tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  
In 2006,  we incurred a charge of $67 million in conjunction with consolidating the manufacturing network at FLNA by closing two plants in the U.S, and rationalizing other assets,  to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies.  
2006 Tax Adjustments 
PepsiCo Share of PBG Tax Settlement In 2006,  the IRS concluded its examination of PBG is consolidated income tax returns for the years 1999 through 2000 (PBG is Tax Settlement).  Consequently,  a 
non-cash benefit of $21 million was included in bottling equity income as part of recording our share of PBG is financial results.  
AJCA Tax Charge In 2005,  we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  in connection with the AJCA and recorded income tax expense of $460 million related to this repatriation.

Results of Continuing Operations — Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below,  effective net pricing reflects the year–over–year impact of discrete pricing actionssales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.  
Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e, kilos,  gallons,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for singleserving sizes of our products.  
In 2006,  total servings increased 55% over the prior year,  as servings for beverages worldwide grew over 6% and servings for snacks worldwide grew 5%.  All of our divisions positively contributed to the total servings growth.  In 2005,  total servings increased 7% compared to 2004,  as servings for beverages worldwide grew over 7% and servings for snacks worldwide grew 6%.  
Net Revenue and Operating Profit 2006 Net revenue increased 8% primarily reflecting higher volume and positive effective net pricing across all divisions.  The volume gains and the effective net pricing each contributed 3 percentage points to net revenue growth.  Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point and foreign exchange contributed almost 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  The absence of the prior year is additional week reduced net revenue by over 1 percentage point and reduced volume growth by almost 1 percentage point.  Total operating profit increased 9% and margin increased 01 percentage points.  The operating profit gains reflect the net revenue growth,  partially offset by the impact of higher raw material and energy costs across all divisions.  The absence of the prior year is additional week reduced operating profit growth by over 1 percentage point.  
2005 Net revenue increased 11% reflectingacross all divisions,  increased volumefavorable effective net pricing and net favorable foreign currency movements.  The volume gains contributed 6 percentage points,  the effective net pricing contributed 3 percentage points and the net favorable foreign currency movements contributed over 1 percentage point.  The 53rd week contributed over 1 percentage point to revenue growth and almost 1 percentage point to volume growth.  
Change 
Total net revenue Operating profit FLNA PBNA PI QFNA Corporate unallocated Restructuring and impairment charges Total operating profit Total operating profit margin 
Total operating profit increased 13% and margin increased 02 percentage points.  The operating profit gains primarily reflect leverage from the revenue growth,  partially offset by higher selling and distribution (S&D) expenses and increased cost of sales,  largely due to higher raw materials,  energy and S&D labor costs,  as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses.  Total operating profit margin also benefited from a favorable comparison to prior year restructuring and impairment charges.  The additional week in 2005 contributed over 1 percentage point to total operating profit growth.  
Corporate Unallocated Expenses Corporate unallocated expenses include the costs of our corporate headquarters,  centrally-managed initiatives,  such 
as our BPT initiative in North Americaunallocated insurance and benefit programs,  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses,  and certain commodity derivative gains and losses,  as well as profit-in-inventory elimination adjustments for our noncontrolled bottling affiliates and certain other items.  In 2006,  corporate unallocated expenses decreased $55 million primarily reflecting the absence of a non-recurring charge of $55 million in the prior year to conform our method of accounting across all divisions,  primarily for warehouse and freight costs.  Higher costs associated with our BPT initiative of $35 million,  as well as the unfavorable comparison to the prior year is $25 million gain in connection with the settlement of a class action 45

In 2005,  corporate unallocated expenses increased 14%.  This increase primarily reflects higher costs associated with our BPT initiative which contributed 7 percentage points Page 46 
increased support behind health and wellness and innovation initiatives which contributed 5 percentage pointsand Corporate departmental expenses and restructuring charges which each contributed 2 percentage points to the increase.  In 2005,  items of a non-recurring nature included charges of $55 million to conform our method of 
accounting across all divisions,  primarily for warehouse and freight costs,  and a gain of $25 million in connection with the settlement of a class action lawsuit related to our purchases of high fructose corn syrup from 1991 to 1995.  In 2004,  we recorded a charge of $50 million for the settlement of a contractual dispute with a former business partner.  
Other Consolidated Results Bottling equity income includes our share of the net income or loss of our noncontrolled bottling affiliates as described in 'Our Customers. " Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time.  Any gains or losses from these changes,  as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments,  are also included on a pre-tax basis.  We continue to sell shares of PBG stock to reduce our ownership to the level at the time of PBG is initial public offering,  since our ownership has increased as a result of PBG is share repurchase program.  We sold 100 million and 75 million shares of PBG stock in 2006 and 2005respectively.  The resulting lower ownership percentage reduces the equity income from PBG that we recognize.  
2006 Bottling equity income increased 11% primarily reflecting a $186 million pretax gain on our sale of PBG stock,  which compared favorably to a $126 million pre-tax gain in the prior year.  The noncash gain of $21 million from our share of PBG is Tax Settlement was fully offset by lower equity income from our anchor bottlers in the current yearprimarily resulting from the impact of their respective adoptions of SFAS 123R in 2006.  Net interest expense decreased 33% primarily reflecting higher average rates on our investments and lower debt balances,  partially offset by lower investment balances and the impact of higher average rates on our borrowings.  
Change 
Bottling equity income Interest expense,  net Annual tax rate Net income — continuing operations Net income per common share — continuing operations — diluted 
The tax rate decreased 168 percentage points compared to prior year primarily reflecting the 2006 Tax Adjustments,  the absence of the 2005 AJCA tax charge and the resolution of certain state income tax audits in the current year.  Net income increased 38% and the related net income per share increased 40%.  These increases primarily reflect the 2006 Tax Settlement,  the absence of the AJCA tax charge and our solid operating profit growth.  
2005 Bottling equity income increased 46% reflecting $126 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock,  as well as stronger bottler results.  Net interest expense increased 4% reflecting the impact of higher debt levels,  substantially offset by higher investment rates and cash balances.  The tax rate increased 114 percentage points reflecting the $460 million AJCA tax charge,  as well as the absence 
of income tax benefits of $266 million recorded in 2004 related to a reduction in foreign tax accruals following the resolution of certain open tax items with foreign tax authorities and a refund claim related to prior U.S.  tax settlements.  This increase was partially offset by increased international profit which is taxed at a lower rate.  Net income from continuing operations decreased 2% and the related net income per common share from continuing operations decreased 1%.  These decreases reflect the impact of the tax items discussed above,  partially offset by our operating profit growthincreased bottling equity income,  which includes the gain on our PBG stock salethe impact of the 53rd week,  a favorable comparison to prior year restructuring and impairment chargesand for net income per share,  the impact of our share repurchases.

2006 Net revenue grew 3% and volume increased 1%.  The volume increase reflects mid-single-digit growth in Oatmeal,  high-single-digit growth in Life cereal and low-single-digit growth in Cap n Crunch cereal.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resources Our strong cash–generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world.  Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow.  This cash–generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating,  investing and financing needs.  In addition,  we have revolving credit facilities that are further discussed in Note 9.  Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday–related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.

Source of Cash 
Operating Activities In 2006,  our operations provided $61 billion of cash compared to $59 billion in the prior year.  The increase primarily reflects our solid business results.  Our operating cash flow in 2006 also reflects increased net tax payments over the prior year of $897 million,  which included $420 million related to our repatriation of international cash in 2005 in connection with the AJCA,  substantially offset by reductions in pension plan contributions over the prior year of $744 million.  
Investing Activities In 2006,  we used $194 million for our investing activities.  Capital spending of $21 billion and acquisitions of $522 million were mostly offset by net sales of short-term investments of $20 billion and proceeds from our sale of PBG stock of $318 million.  The increase in capital spending over the prior year primarily reflects increased investments at PI and in our North American Gatorade business,  as well as increased support behind our ongoing BPT initiative.  In 2005,  we used $35 billion,  primarily reflecting capital spending of $17 billion,  acquisitions of $11 billionprimarily the $750 million acquisition of General Mills' minority interest in Snack Ventures Europe,  and net purchases of 52 
short-term investments of $10 billion.  These amounts were partially offset by the proceeds from our sale of PBG stock of $214 million.  In the first quarter of 2007,  we completed our acquisition of Naked Juice Company which was funded with existing domestic cash.  This acquisition will be included in the first quarter of 2007 as an investing activity in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  We anticipate net capital spending of approximately $26 billion in 2007,  which is expected to be within our net capital spending target of approximately 5% to 7% of net revenue in each of the next few years.  Planned capital spending in 2007 includes increased investments at PI,  particularly in the developing and emerging markets,  and additional investments in manufacturing capacity to support our North American Gatorade business as well as other non-carbonated beverage businesses.  New capital projects are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must meet certain payback and internal rate of return targets.  
Financing Activities In 2006,  we used $60 billion for our financing activities,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our 
Use of Cash 
shareholders through common share repurchases of $30 billion and dividend payments of $19 billion.  Net repayments of short-term borrowings of $23 billion were partially offset by stock option proceeds of $12 billion.  In 2005we used $19 billion for our financing activities,  primarily reflecting share repurchases of $30 billion and dividend payments of $16 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $18 billion and stock option proceeds of $11 billion.  On May 3,  2006,  our Board of Directors authorized and publicly announced our new $85 billion repurchase program,  which expires on June 30,  2009.  Since inception of the new program,  we have repurchased $11 billion of shares,  leaving $74 billion of remaining authorization.  We have historically repurchased significantly more shares each year than we have issued under our stock-based compensation plans,  with average net annual repurchases of 14% of outstanding shares for the last five years.  We target an annual dividend payout of approximately 45% of prior year is net income from continuing operations.  Annuallywe review our capital structure with our Board,  including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.

2006 Net cash provided by operating activities Capital spending Sales of property,  plant and equipment Management operating cash flow 
Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value,  and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  it is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  The table above reconciles the net cash provided by operating activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to our management operating cash flow.  Management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return approximately all of our management operating cash flow to our shareholders 
Use of Cash 
through dividends and share repurchases.  However,  see 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.  
Credit Ratings Our debt ratings of Aa3 from Moody is and A+ from Standard & Poor is contribute to our ability to access global capital markets.  We have maintained strong investment grade ratings for over a decade.  Each rating is considered strong investment grade and is in the first quartile of their respective ranking systems.  These ratings also reflect the impact of our anchor bottlers' cash flows and debt.  
Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments 
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangementsother than in the normal course of business,  nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers,  noncontrolled affiliates or third parties.  However,  certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us.  At year-end 2006,  we believe it is remote that these guarantees would require any cash payment.  We do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing or disclosing assets or liabilities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In addition,  we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our economic ownership interest.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Our share of the net income of noncontrolled bottling affiliates is reported in our income statement as bottling equity income.  Bottling equity income also includes any changes in our ownership interests of these affiliates.  Bottling equity income includes $186 million and $126 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock in 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  See Note 8 for additional information on our significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  In 2005,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  
In connection with our ongoing BPT initiative,  we aligned certain accounting policies across our divisions in 2005.  We conformed our methodology for calculating our bad debt reserves and modified our policy for recognizing revenue for products shipped to customers by third-party carriers.  Additionally,  we conformed our method of accounting for certain costs,  primarily warehouse and freight.  These changes reduced our net revenue by $36 million and our operating profit by $60 million in 2005.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilities,  are included in cost of sales.  The costs of moving,  storing and delivering finished product are included in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported 
amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenuesexpenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  tax reserves,  stockbased compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands,  goodwill and other long-lived assets.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  See 'Our Divisions" below and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results,  see 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless notedand are based on unrounded amounts.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the 2006 presentation.  
fourth quarter of 2005,  we began centrally managing commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  Certain of the commodity derivatives,  primarily those related to the purchase of energy for use by our divisions,  do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.  Such derivatives are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  division results 
reflect the contract purchase price of the energy or other commodities.  Division results are based on how our President and Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and reallocates resources to our divisions.  Division results exclude certain Corporate-initiated restructuring and impairment charges.  For additional unaudited information on our divisions,  see 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Our Divisions We manufacture or use contract manufacturers,  market and sell a variety of salty,  sweet and grain-based snacks,  carbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  and foods through our North American and international business divisions.  Our North American divisions include the United States and Canada.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for certain allocation methodologies for stockbased compensation expense and pension and retiree medical expensesas described in the unaudited information in 'Our Critical Accounting Policies.

house-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our historical experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We are exposed 
to concentration of credit risk by our customers,  Wal-Mart and PBG.  In 2006Wal-Mart represented approximately 9% of our total net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart; and PBG represented approximately 10%.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.

Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to our customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $101 billion in 2006,  $89 billion in 2005 and $78 billion in 2004.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rights,  extend beyond one year.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over no longer than the contract period and the remaining balances of $297 million at December 302006 and $321 million at December 312005 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Other marketplace spending includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities and is reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Advertising expenses were $17 billion in 2006,  $18 billion in 2005 and $17 billion in 2004.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:  media and personal service prepayments promotional materials in inventory,  and  production costs of future media advertising.  Deferred advertising costs of $171 million and $202 million at yearend 2006 and 2005,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  
Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $46 billion in 2006$41 billion in 2005 and $39 billion in 2004.  
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less which we do not intend to rollover beyond three months.  
Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the softwarewhich approximate five to seven years.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $537 million at December 30,  2006 and $327 million at December 31,  2005.  
Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9.  
Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities.  These activities principally involve the development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing products,  improvement and modernization of production processes,  and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines.  Research and development costs were $344 million in 2006 and $340 million in 2005 and are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements As further discussed in Note 6,  we adopted SFAS 123R on January 1,  2006.  As further discussed in Note 7,  we adopted SFAS 158 on December 30,  2006.  In September 2006,  the SEC issued SAB 108 to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements.  SAB 108 requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures.  On December 30,  2006,  we adopted SAB 108.  Our adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our financial statements.  In July 2006,  the FASB issued FIN 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.  FIN 48 requires that we recognize in our financial statements,  the impact of a tax position,  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,  based on the technical merits of the position.  The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal yearwith the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.  We do not expect our adoption of FIN 48 to materially impact our financial statements.  In September 2006,  the FASB issued SFAS 157 which defines fair valueestablishes a framework for measuring fair value,  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial statements.

Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2006 Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2006,  we incurred a charge of $67 million ($43 million after-tax or $003 per share) in conjunction with consolidating the manufacturing network at FLNA by closing two plants in the U.S.,  and rationalizing other assets,  to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies.  The charge was comprised of $43 million of asset impairments,  $14 million of severance and other employee costs and $10 million of other costs.  Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 380 employees.  We expect all of the cash payments related to this charge to be paid by the end of 2007.  
2005 Restructuring Charges In 2005,  we incurred a charge of $83 million ($55 million after-tax or $003 per share) in conjunction with actions taken to reduce costs in our operations,  principally through headcount reductions.  Of this charge,  $34 million related to FLNA$21 million to PBNA,  $16 million to PI and $12 million to Corporate.  Most of this charge related to the termination of approximately 700 employees.  As of December 30,  2006,  all terminations had occurred and substantially no accrual remains.  
2004 Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2004,  we incurred a charge of $150 million ($96 million after-tax or $006 per 
share) in conjunction with the consolidation of FLNA is manufacturing network as part of its ongoing productivity program.  Of this charge,  $93 million related to asset impairments,  primarily reflecting the closure of four U.S.  plants.  Production from these plants was redeployed to other FLNA facilities in the U.S.  The remaining $57 million included employee-related costs of $29 millioncontract termination costs of $8 million and other exit costs of $20 million.  Employee-related costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 700 employees.  As of December 302006,  all terminations had occurred and substantially no accrual remains.

4:09 PM 
Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset is estimated useful life.  Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five yearsbased on average 2006 foreign exchange rates,  is expected to be $49 million in 2007,  $49 million in 2008$47 million in 2009,  $46 million in 2010 and $44 million in 2011.  Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on discounted future cash flows.  
Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.  For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Nonamortizable Intangible Assets Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair valueas determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a

reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair valuewe complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations.  The change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets is as follows:

Carryforwards,  Credits and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $61 billion at year-end 2006 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $02 billion in 2007$50 billion between 2008 and 2026 and $09 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  In addition,  certain tax credits generated in prior periods of approximately $339 million are available to reduce certain foreign tax liabilities through 2011.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit.  
Undistributed International Earnings The AJCA created a one-time incentive for U.S.  corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction.  In 2005,  we repatriated approximately $75 billion in earnings previously considered indefinitely rein Page 65 
vested outside the U.S.  and recorded income tax expense of $460 million related to this repatriation.  Other than the earnings repatriated,  we intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future andtherefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  At December 30,  2006,  we had approximately $108 billion of undistributed international earnings.  
Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  In 2006,  we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $602 million,  substantially all of which related to the IRS is examination of our consolidated income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  The IRS issued a Revenue Agent is Report (RAR),  and we are in agreement with their conclusion,  except for one matter which we continue to dispute.  The agreed adjustments relate to transfer pricing and various other transactions,  including certain acquisitions,  the public offering of PBG,  as well as the restructuring of our international snack foods operations during that audit period.  During 2004,  we recognized $266 million of tax benefits related to the 
favorable resolution of certain previously open tax issues.  In addition,  in 2004,  we recognized a tax benefit of $38 million upon agreement with the IRS on a previously open issue related to our discontinued restaurant operations.  The IRS has initiated their audits of our tax returns for the years 2003 through 2005.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interestin light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  Our tax reserves,  covering all federal,  state and foreign jurisdictions,  are presented on our balance sheet within other liabilities (see Note 14),  except for any amounts relating to items we expect to pay in the coming year which are included in current income taxes payable.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results. " As further discussed in Note 2,  we will adopt FIN 48 as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year.  
Note 6 — Stock–Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  A majority of our employees participate in our stock-based compensation programs.  In addition,  members of our Board of Directors participate in our stock-based compensation program in connection with their service on our Board.  Stock options and RSUs are granted to employees under the shareholderapproved 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  our only active stock-based plan.  Stock-based compensation 
expense was $270 million in 2006$311 million in 2005 and $368 million in 2004.  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $80 million in 2006,  $87 million in 2005 and $103 million in 2004.  Stock-based compensation cost capitalized in connection with our BPT initiative was $3 million in 2006$4 million in 2005 and none in 2004.  At year-end 2006,  36 million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.  For additional unaudited information on our stockbased compensation program,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options,  which include grants under our executive program and broad-based SharePower program,  under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  generally three years.  65 
9:20 AM 
Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% RSUs.  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Each RSU is 
accounted for our stock-based compensation plans under the fair value provisions of SFAS 123,  our adoption did not significantly impact our financial position or our results of operations.  Under SFAS 123R,  actual tax benefits recognized in excess of tax benefits previously established upon grant are reported as a financing cash inflow.  Prior to adoptionsuch excess tax benefits were reported as an operating cash inflow.  
settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets.  There have been no reductions to the exercise price of previously issued awards,  and any repricing of awards would require approval of our shareholders.  On January 1,  2006,  we adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method.  Since we had previously

Note 7 — Pension,  Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the costs.  We use a September 30 measurement date and all plan assets and liabilities are generally reported as of that date.  Other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our 
assumptions and from changes in our assumptions are also determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of those expected to benefit,  which is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 13 years for retiree medical.  On December 30,  2006,  we adopted SFAS 158 which requires that we recog Before Application of SFAS 158 Other nonamortizable intangible assets Other assets Total assets Accounts payable and other current liabilities Other liabilities Deferred income taxes Total liabilities Accumulated other comprehensive loss Total common shareholders' equity 
nize the overfunded or underfunded status of our Plans as an asset or liability on our December 30,  2006 balance sheet.  Subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.  SFAS 158 also requires that,  beginning in 2008,  our assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses be determined as of the balance sheet date,  and all plan assets and liabilities be reported as of that date.  In accordance with SFAS 158,  prior year amounts have not been adjusted.  The following illustrates the incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual line items on our balance sheet as of December 30,  2006:

Future Benefit Payments and Funding Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: Pension Retiree medical* 
*Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Act.  Subsidies are expected to be approximately $5 million for each of the years from 2007 through 2011 and approximately $40 million for 2012 through 2016.  
These future benefits to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded pension plans.  In 2007,  we expect to make pension contributions of up to $150 million with up to $75 million expected to be discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be approximately $85 million in 2007.  
Pension Assets The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience,  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for longterm rates of return.  We use a market-related value method that 
recognizes each year is asset gain or loss over a five-year period.  Therefore,  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the value of pension plan assets that is used to calculate the expected return.  Our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is established based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk,  and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they are due.  Our investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified 
equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectation.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments to enhance the overall return of the portfolio.  We use a third-party advisor to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long-term rate of return assumptions.  Our expected longterm rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%,  reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 93% from equity securities and 58% from fixed income securities.  Our target allocation and actual pension plan asset allocations for the plan years 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 
Actual Allocation Asset Category 
Target Allocation 
Equity securities Debt securities Other,  primarily cash Total 
Pension assets include 55 million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a market value of $358 million in 2006and 55 million shares with a market value of $311 million in 2005.  Our investment policy limits the investment in PepsiCo stock at the time of investment to 10% of the fair value of plan assets.  
Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 9% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2007.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2011 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical 1% Increase

Related Party Transactions Our significant related party transactions involve our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  We sell concentrate to these affiliates,  which they use in the produc 2006 
tion of CSDs and non-carbonated beverages.  We also sell certain finished goods to these affiliates and we receive royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products.  Sales of concentrate 
end 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  Bottling equity income includes $186 million and $126 million of pretax gains on our sales of PBG stock in 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  
Our investment in PBG,  which includes the related goodwill,  was $500 million and $400 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2006 and 2005respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year-end 2006 and 2005,  the calculated market value of our shares in PBG,  excluding our investment in Bottling Group,  LLCexceeded our investment balance by approximately $14 billion and $15 billion,  respectively.  
Our investment in PAS,  which includes the related goodwill,  was $316 million and $292 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2006 and 2005respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year-end 2006 and 2005,  the calculated market value of our shares in PepsiAmericas exceeded our investment balance by approximately $173 million and $364 million,  respectively.  In January 2005,  PAS acquired a regional bottler,  Central Investment Corporation.  The table includes the results of Central Investment Corporation from the transaction date forward.  and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding.  For further unaudited information on these bottlers,  see 'Our Customers" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.

These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows: 2006 
Net revenue $4837 Selling,  general and administrative expenses $87 Accounts and notes receivable $175 Accounts payable and other current liabilities $62 
Such amounts are settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables.  See Note 9 regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt.  
In addition,  we coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the negotiation and purchase of sweeteners and other raw materials requirements for certain of 
our bottlers with suppliers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting party,  we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  
Note 9 — Debt Obligations and Commitments 2006 Short-term debt obligations Current maturities of long-term debt Commercial paper (53% and 33%) Other borrowings (73% and 74%) Amounts reclassified to long-term debt 
The interest rates in the above table reflect weighted-average rates at year-end.  
In the second quarter of 2006,  we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit agreement which enables us to borrow up to $15 billion subject to customary terms and conditions.  Funds borrowed under this agreement may be used for general corporate purposesincluding supporting our outstanding commercial paper issuances.  The agreement terminates in May 2011 and replaces our previous $21 billion of credit facilities.  As of December 302006,  we have reclassified $15 billion of short-term debt to long-term based on our intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis.  In addition,  $394 million of our debt related to borrowings from various lines of credit maintained for our international divisions.  These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions 
and are fully committed to the extent of our borrowings.  In the third quarter of 2006,  we entered into a U.S.  $25 billion euro medium term note program.  Under the program,  we may issue unsecured notes under mutually agreed upon terms with the purchasers of the notes.  Proceeds from any issuance of notes may be used for general corporate purposes,  except as otherwise specified in the related prospectus.  As of December 30,  2006we have no outstanding notes under the program.  
Interest Rate Swaps We entered into interest rate swaps in 2004 to effectively convert the interest rate of a specific debt issuance from a fixed rate of 32% to a variable rate.  The variable weighted-average interest rate that we pay is linked to LIBOR and is subject to change.  The notional 
amount of the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 30,  2006 and December 31,  2005 was $500 million.  The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The swaps mature in May 2007.  At December 30,  2006,  approximately 63% of total debt,  after the impact of the related interest rate swaps,  was exposed to variable interest rates,  compared to 78% at December 31,  2005.  In addition to variable rate long-term debt,  all debt with maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.  
Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps In 2004,  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to hedge the currency exposure on U.S.  dollar denominated debt of $50 million held by a foreign affiliate.  The terms of this swap match the terms of the debt it modifies.  The swap matures in 2008.  The unrealized gain related to this swap was less than $1 million at December 30,  2006 and December 31,  2005resulting in a U.S.  dollar liability of $50 million.  We have also entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure on U.S.  dollar denominated intercompany debt of $95 million at December 30,  2006 and $125 million at December 31,  2005.  The terms of the swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The swaps mature in 2007.  The net unrealized loss related to these swaps was less than $1 million at December 30,  2006 and the net unrealized gain related to these swaps was $5 million at December 31,  2005.

Long-Term Contractual Commitments Payments Due by Period Long-term debt obligations(a) Interest on debt obligations(b) Operating leases Purchasing commitments Marketing commitments Other commitments 
(a) Excludes current maturities of long-term debt of $605 million which are classified within current liabilities,  as well as short-term borrowings reclassified as long-term debt of $1500 million.  (b) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 30,  2006.  The above table reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 30,  2006 based on year-end foreign exchange rates.  
Most long-term contractual commitments,  except for our long-term debt obligations,  are not recorded on our balance sheet.  Non-cancelable operating leases primarily represent building leases.  Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges and orange juice,  cooking oil and packaging materials.  Non-cancelable marketing commitments primarily are for sports marketing.  Bottler funding is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis.  See Note 7 regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations and discussion below regarding our commitments to noncontrolled bottling affiliates and former restaurant operations.  
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangementsother than in the normal course of business,  nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to our bottlers,  noncontrolled affiliates or third parties.  However,  certain guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation of our bottling and restaurant operations from us.  In connection with these transactions,  we have guaranteed $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt through 2012 and $23 million of YUM! Brands,  Inc.  is (YUM) outstanding obligations,  primarily property leases,  through 2020.  The terms of our Bottling Group,  LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the 
structure of PBG is separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling Group,  LLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed.  Our guarantees of certain obligations ensured YUM is continued use of certain properties.  These guarantees would require our cash payment if YUM failed to perform under these lease obligations.  See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Note 10 — Risk Management We are exposed to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange risks interest rates stock prices,  and  discount rates affecting the measurement of our pension and retiree medical liabilities.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through 
earnings.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earningsconsistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a resultany change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings 
impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related gain or loss and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transactionwe recognize the related gain or loss in net income in that period.  We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes,  and we 73 
4:09 PM 
limit our exposure to individual counterparties to manage credit risk.  
Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders,  pricing agreements,  geographic diversity and derivatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than two years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for natural gas and diesel fuel.  For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  However,  such commodity cash flow hedges have not had any significant ineffectiveness for all periods presented.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net gains of $1 million related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Derivatives 
used to hedge commodity price risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market each period and reflected in our income statement.  
Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate approximately 40% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  the United Kingdom and Canada comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks from unforeseen economic changes and political unrest.  On occasion,  we enter into hedges,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rates.  Ineffectiveness of these hedges has not been material.  
Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  These 2006

swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principalinterest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  These swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  
Stock Prices The portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on certain market indices and on our stock price is subject to market risk.  We hold mutual fund investments and prepaid forward contracts to manage this risk.  Changes in the fair value of these investments and contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and are offset by changes in the related compensation liability.  
Fair Value All derivative instruments are recognized on our balance sheet at fair value.  The fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices.  Book and fair values of our derivative and financial instruments are as follows: 2005

(f) Asset included within other assets.  (g) Reported in other liabilities.  
This table excludes guarantees,  including our guarantee of $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt.  The guarantee had a fair value of $35 million at December 30,  2006 and $47 million at December 31,  2005 based on a third-party estimate of the cost to us of transferring the liability to an independent financial institution.  See Note 9 for additional information on our guarantees.  74

Note 11 — Net Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations Basic net income per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include 
the effect that would occur if in-themoney employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 01 million shares in 2006,  30 million shares in 2005 and 70 million shares in 2004 were not included in the calculation of 
diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-themoney.  Out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $6524 in 2006,  $5377 in 2005 and $5288 in 2004.
