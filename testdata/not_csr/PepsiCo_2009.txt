Indra K.  Nooyi,  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Dear Fellow ShareholdersA Roman author said more than two millennia ago that anyone can steer the ship when the sea is calm.  The true test of endurance and stamina,  he went on,  is to navigate through rough waters.  Well,  this year has seen some of the roughest possible waters.  The economic tempest of 2008 turned into the perfect storm of 2009.  Business was battered by volatile commodity costs,  frozen credit markets,  fluctuating currencies and negative GDP rates.  At PepsiCo,  it seemed as if each day brought a new challenge.  Every one of them tested the strength and capabilities of our organization.  And I can declare with great pride that we passed the test of endurance and stamina wonderfully well.  We are a company with great resilience.  The ability of our associates to pull together has left me excited about our momentum from 2009 into 2010 and beyond.  I don't think this is due just to the ability of all the great people we have.  I think our company is more than the sum of those considerable parts; we draw extra strength from the solid foundation of values and principles upon which PepsiCo is built.  The business community and government did a great deal of soul-searching in the midst of the challenging global economyseeking to uncover the source of our world is financial problems and how best to share responsibility to address the situation.  As debates raged on issues that are core to a vibrant,  functioning marketplace,  it became increasingly clear as the year went on that corporate ethics are inexorably linked to a healthy economy.  A former American president,  Dwight Eisenhower,  once said,  'A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both. " The same is true of a company,  and the past 18 months have proved the wisdom of the remark.  Here at PepsiCo,  we are fortunate to have embedded Performance with Purpose into our culture and fabric long before this current downturn.  It is one of the fundamental factors that kept PepsiCo on the leading edge in 2009.  Our basic belief—that companies today must marry performance with ethical concerns—is resonating more than ever before.  For consumers,  this translates into receiving valueboth economic and social,  from trusted brands.  For governments and the wider public,  it translates into responsibility.  
This acknowledges that businesses have a responsibility to the communities in which they operate,  to the consumers they serve and to the environment whose resources they use.  We provide great-tasting products,  outstanding quality and supreme value to consumers worldwide,  while maintaining an underpinning of integrity and responsibility.  We have instilled this fundamental belief into all of our brands—Quaker Oats,  TropicanaSabritas,  Walkers,  Lay is,  Gatorade and Pepsi-Cola,  to name a few— to ensure we offer consumers a diverse portfolio of enjoyable and wholesome nutritious foods and beverages.  We take seriously our responsibility to find innovative ways to use less energywater and packaging,  our responsibility to hire local people in the communities where we operate,  create products designed for local tastes,  and partner with local producers and suppliers.  And,  we have expanded our responsibility to partner with local governments and NGOs to address the growing twin problems of malnutrition and obesity acute to different parts of the world.  Performance with Purpose means that we will continue to bring together what is good for society and what is good for business.  It encourages us to think globally while acting locally.  It has helped us break into new regions and harness local products and talent to drive our growth.  It drives our commitment to increase diversity in the workforce,  enhancing our ability to

It has helped us break into new regions and harness local products and talent to drive our growth.  It drives our commitment to increase diversity in the workforce,  enhancing our ability to 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
recruit the brightest and most talented associates from around the world.  And it helps keep us focused on staying strong over the long term so that we are well-prepared to capitalize on all growth opportunities.  Most importantly,  the promise of PepsiCo is to continue to generate solid value for our shareholders.  PEPSICO DELIVERED SOLID FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2009 Amidst the most challenging global macroeconomic environment in decades,  we demonstrated the strength and resilience of both our people and portfolio by delivering solid operating performance and generating significant operating cash flow.   Net revenue grew 5% on a constant currency basis. *  Core division operating profit rose 6% on a constant currency basis. *  Core EPS grew 6% on a constant currency basis. *  Management operating cash flow,  excluding certain itemsreached $56 billion,  up 16%. *  And,  we raised the annual dividend by 6%.  Let me oﬀer a few highlights from 2009: PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF) had another exceptional year with strong net revenue and operating profit growth despite significant commodity inflation.  We held or grew share across the region,  sustaining consumer momentum with solid innovation and targeted value oﬀerings.  Although all of Europe was hit hard by the economic recession,  PepsiCo Europe outpaced its peers and delivered solid results through excellent revenue management,  tight cost controls and outstanding productivity.  PepsiCo Asia Middle East and Africa (AMEA) had another excellent year,  with solid net revenue and operating profit growth driven by strong volume growth across the region,  with exceptional growth in our India beverage business.  PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB),  which faced considerable category pressures in North America,  continued to make significant progress in rejuvenating the entire beverage portfolio.  We successfully launched the Pepsi 'Refresh Everything" campaign,  gained traction on our Gatorade transformation to 'G, " * Core results and core results on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items.  Please refer to pages 91 and 92 for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP.  
and brought exciting innovation to market with the launch of zero-calorie SoBe Lifewater and Trop50 orange juice beverageboth naturally sweetened with purified stevia extract.  We also reached agreement on merging into PepsiCo our two anchor bottlers,  Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas,  in order to create a more agile,  eﬃcient,  innovative and competitive beverage system,  which will enable us to extend our leadership position in the North American Liquid Refreshment Beverage business.  With the merger of our anchor bottlers,  PepsiCo will be a nearly $60 billion company in terms of annual revenue.  We are the largest food and beverage business in North America and the second-largest food and beverage business in the world,  making us a critical partner for all retailers.  We will have a new business structure and,  as outlined below,  clear strategies to support continued strong growth—growth that will enable us to continue to be both an attractive place to work and an attractive investment.  STRATEGIES TO DRIVE OUR GROWTH We continue to focus on delivering top-quartile financial performance in both the near term and the long term,  while making the global investments in key regions and targeted product categories to drive sustainable growth.  The next chapter in our growth is founded on six long-term growth strategies: 1.  Expand the Global Leadership Position of Our Snacks Business.  PepsiCo is the global snacks leader,  with the No.  1 savory category share position in virtually every key region across the globe.  We have advantaged positions across the entire value chain in more than 40 developed and developing regions in which we operate as we capitalize on local manufacturing and optimized go-to-market capabilities in each region,  as well as the ability to introduce locally relevant products using global capabilities.  And we have significant growth opportunities as we expand our current businesses in these regions,  extend our reach into new geographies and enter adjacent categories.  Importantly,  we will continue to make our core snacks healthier through innovations in hearthealthier oil,  sodium reduction and the addition of whole grains,  nuts and seeds.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
2.    Ensure Sustainable,  Profitable Growth in Global  Beverages.  The merger with our anchor bottlers creates a lean,  agile organization in North America with an optimized supply chain,  a flexible go-to-market system and enhanced innovation capabilities.  When combined with the actions we are taking to refresh our brands across the entire beverage category,  we believe this game-changing transaction will enable us to accelerate our top-line growth and also improve our profitability.  We continue to see significant areas of global beverage growth,  particularly in developing markets and in evolving categories.  We will invest in those attractive opportunities,  concentrating in geographies and categories in which we are the leader or a close second,  or where the competitive game remains wide open.  Additionally,  we will use our R&D capabilities to develop low- and zero-calorie beverages that taste great and add positive nutrition such as fiber,  vitamins and calcium.  3.   U   nleash the Power of 'Power of One. " PepsiCo is in the unique position to leverage two extraordinary consumer categories that have special relevance to retailers across the globe.  Our snacks and beverages are both high-velocity categories; both generate retail traffic; both are very profitable; and both deliver exceptional cash flow.  The combination of snacks and beverages—with our high-demand global and local brands—makes PepsiCo an essential partner for largeformat as well as small-format retailers.  We will increasingly use this portfolio and the high coincidence of consumption of these products through integrated offerings (productsmarketing and merchandising) to create value for consumers and deliver greater top-line growth for retailers.  We also will be accelerating Power of One supply chain and back-office synergies in many regions to improve profitability and enhance customer service.  4.    Rapidly Expand Our 'Good-for-You" Portfolio.  PepsiCo currently has a roughly $10 billion core of 'Good-for-You" products anchored by: Tropicana,  Naked juice,  LebedyanskySandora and our other juice brands; Aquafina; Quaker Oats; 
Gatorade (for athletes); the new dairy joint venture with Almarai; and local 'Good-for-You" products and brands.  We will build on this core with an increasing stream of science-based innovation derived from the R&D capabilities that we have been ramping up over the past couple of years,  as well as from targeted acquisitions and joint ventures.  We will be investing to accelerate the growth of these platforms,  and we will use the knowledge from these initiatives to improve our core snack and beverage offerings and also to develop highly nutritious products for undernourished people across the world.  5.  C   ontinue to Deliver on Our Environmental  Sustainability Goals and Commitments.  We are committed to protecting the Earth is natural resources and are well on our way to meeting our public goals for meaningful reductions in water,  electricity and fuel usage.  Our businesses around the world are implementing innovative approaches to be significantly more efficient in the use of land,  energywater and packaging—and we are actively working with the communities in which we operate to be responsive to their resource needs.  In 2009,  we formalized our commitment to water as a human right,  and we will focus not only on world-class efficiency in our operations,  but also on preserving water resources and enabling access to safe water.  Our climate change focus is on reducing our carbon footprintincluding a reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions through continued improvement in energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources.  We actively work with our farmers to promote sustainable agriculture—and we are developing new packaging alternatives in both snacks and beverages to reduce our impact on the environment.  6.  C   herish Our Associates and Develop the Leadership to  Sustain Our Growth.  We have an extraordinary talent base across our global organization—in our manufacturing facilitiesour sales and distribution organizations,  our marketing groupsour staff functions and with our general managers.  As we expand our businesses,  we are placing heightened focus on ensuring that we maintain an inclusive environment and on 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
developing the careers of our associates—all with the goal of continuing to have the leadership talent,  capabilities and experience necessary to grow our businesses well into the future.

Better Choices—From Morning to Night The choices consumers make,  and the PepsiCo products they buy,  reflect not just who and where they are,  but also what they enjoy throughout the day.  After allwhen they eat better,  they feel better.  That is why our portfolio oﬀers diverse choices that deliver convenience,  aﬀordability and great taste.  For years,  we have been working to provide healthier snack and food choices for every occasion.  Frito-Lay led the 
industry as the first to remove trans fats from all its snack chip products.  Today,  whether it is Quaker Oatmeal or Lay is potato chips,  consumers around the world can choose products that are right for them and good for their families.  Parents can send their kids to school with our Quaker Chewy Bar,  a nutritious whole grain snack that contains no high fructose corn syrup.  For an afternoon snack,  a Quaker Galletas de Avena cookie delivers enjoyment with wholesome ingredients.  
For dinner,  Near East Pearled Couscous gives families the casual elegance of a chef-made,  budget-friendly meal while dining at home.  And for daytime snacks or late-night gatherings,  new Grain Waves with wholesome corn,  wheat and oats gives adults a healthier option.  Choices like these—along with active lifestyles—make it easier for consumers to enjoy the foods they like and achieve the energy balance they need to lead active lifestyles.  
Frito-Lay North America began to produce potato chips with sunflower oil in 2006; since then it has reduced saturated fats by 50 percent and removed trans fats from all products.  Between 2003 and 2008 in the United Kingdom,  our business reduced saturated fats in Walkers snacks and crisps by 70–80 percentand salt levels by 25–55 percent.

Around the world,  consumers love to snack—and many look to nuts and seeds to deliver rich sources of protein,  vitamin Emagnesium and other nutrients.  These benefits make nuts and seeds an especially relevant and fast-growing category— many of the products contribute to heart health and weight management in unique ways that many other snack categories cannot deliver.  We are building scale and advantage in this $14 billion global category by leveraging our strengths as the world is No.  2 nuts and seeds seller—and the only truly global competitor in our category.  Over the last several years,  we have generated solid revenue growth by bringing innovation to flavors,  textures,  forms and packaging through our go-to-market system.  And our nuts and seeds products stand out on grocery shelves,  sold under the brands consumers have come to know and trust—Frito-Lay in the United States,  Sabritas and Mafer in Mexico,  Simba in South Africa,  Duyvis in Holland,  Spitz in Canada,  Benenuts in France and Belgium,  Matutano in Spain and Portugal,  Nutrinut in Venezuela and Nobby is in Australia.

In Dallas,  working out of kid-friendly,  PepsiCo Hopebranded trucks,  our team entered underprivileged neighborhoods where children do not have access to traditional summer programs.  It delivered nutritious breakfasts that included milk,  an apple and a Quaker Oatmeal bar and snacks consisting of a Tropicana juice and a baked Frito-Lay product.  
Hope for Accessible Nutrition PepsiCo is promoting healthy eating worldwide by developing new products rich in whole grains,  fruits,  vegetablesfiber,  key vitamins and nutrients.  We also are taking aim at a much broader issue: how to bring sustainable nutrition to the world is most vulnerable and underserved populations.  In the United States,  PepsiCo Hope is our initiative to improve access to nutrition in urban communities.  In partnership with Central Dallas Ministries,  PepsiCo Hope in 2009 piloted a mobile feeding program in Dallas,  Texas,  delivering more than 50000 nutritious breakfasts and 
snacks—including many PepsiCo products—to underserved children.  Additionally in 2009,  the PepsiCo Foundation contributed more than $3 million to key academic and community organizations working to address nutritional challenges in the United States.  These organizations included Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition,  Children in Balance and the National Council of LaRaza,  Cuidemos Nuestra Salud.  We are also pursuing sustainable nutrition initiatives internationally as a first step to understand how local food quality price and access can contribute to hunger and malnutrition.  Along with global and local partners,  we are developing locally relevant fortified products and will use our supply chain to distribute them to hardto-reach communities in such countries as Nigeria and India.  Supporting international efforts to address chronic hunger in underserved communities,  the PepsiCo Foundation disbursed close to $4 million in grants during 2009 to organizations including the World Food Programme and Save the Children.

From Global Brands to Local Flavors Our global brands win consumers' trust with their quality and taste.  We further deepen our relationships with consumers through our local brands that appeal to their unique cultural norms,  tastes and aspirations.  In Russia,  we established our relationship with consumers 50 years ago when we introduced them to Pepsi.  At the start of 2009,  we added to our success in Russia with the launch of Lay is red-caviar-flavored chipswhich presented a uniquely Russian flavor that is a traditional symbol of the New Year holidays.  In the vibrant markets east of the Middle East,  we brought enjoymentfreshness and nutrition to family tea time with Aliva,  a new biscuit that combines wheat and lentils with the authentic local savory or sweet flavors that families in India prefer.  We also introduced Nimbooz lemon drink,  our own version of India is homemade Nimbu Pani,  allowing consumers of all ages to enjoy the goodness of lemon juice with no fizz,  no artificial flavors and the trustworthiness of our local brand.  Much of this innovation stems from the work of our local research teamswhich draw on their social,  cultural and nutritional knowledge to extend product lines and create new ones.  PepsiCo also created platforms for future innovation of more nutritiouslocally relevant products.  In 2009,  we established a joint venture with Calbee Foods,  Japan is leading snack company,  and we acquired Amacoco,  Brazil is largest coconut water company.  
Russia Russians got their first taste of Pepsi-Cola in 1959,  and it would become the first Western consumer product produced and sold in the USSR.  In 2009,  PepsiCo announced that it will invest $1 billion in Russia over three years to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity there and introduce agricultural technology to ensure the highest crop yields and quality standards.  This investment is expected to create 2000 jobs.  
Dubai In 2009,  PepsiCo and Dubai Refreshments Company celebrated 50 years of distributing beverages in Dubai and the Northern Emirates.  As the economy of Dubai has grown,  distribution of PepsiCo beverages has increased dramatically.

Contribute to a Healthier Planet We believe that we will do better by doing good for the planet— that there is a close connection between productive operations and environmental stewardship.  We are rethinking the way we operate our business to minimize our impact on the environment by finding innovative ways to grow,  source,  make,  package and transport our foods and beverages.  We are reaching out to local farmers,  governments and community groups to improve agricultural practices and improve crop yields through advanced agricultural technologies and practices.  We are forming local partnerships to better manage watersheds and improve access to safe water.  We are deploying processes and technologies that reduce the amount of energy and water required to manufacture our products,  and that make use of alternative energy sources.  This careful management of resources drives healthy business results and helps create a healthier future for our planet.  
 Green Future We operate in local communities around the world,  and we are investing in innovative ways to minimize our environmental impact.  We are building facilities that conserve energy and raw materials and reduce waste.  And across our operations,  we are working with environmental organizations to understand local ecological challenges and apply advanced,  scientifically based practices to address them.  In 2009,  we introduced new Sustainable Engineering Guide­ lines that apply to our new construction and major reengineering projects worldwide.  In the United States,  our corporate facility in Chicago meets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards for efficient and sustainable energy use and materials.  And in Chongqing,  China,  we opened a new beverage facility designed to use 22 percent less water and 23 percent less energy than the average PepsiCo plant in China.  The plant uses its innovative environmental management system to monitor water and energy use on every production line and every piece of equipment in real time.  These technologies will help the plant reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 3100 tons and conserve 100 million liters of water each year.  Working with national and local governments,  we also estab­ lished environmental and investment strategies for each region based on local needs.  In the Netherlands,  we are working with the local government and nearby companies to investigate how we can increase the amount of sustainable energy we produce instead of buying only renewable energy.  Through these and other environmentally responsible practices,  we are pursuing our goals to reduce our consumption of water by 20 percentelectricity by 20 percent and fuel by 25 percent per unit of production by 2015,  compared with our 2006 consumption.  18

Breaking Ground with Sustainable Packaging Packaging gives consumers a window into their favorite PepsiCo products,  carrying everything from nutrition labels to special oﬀers.  It can also reflect our commitment to a sustainable future.  We are looking at every part of the packaging process—from the way we select and design packages to how we procure and dispose of them.  And we continue to pursue innovative ways to reduce total volume,  recycle containersuse renewable resources and remove environmentally sensitive materials.  In Mexico,  we implemented the use of oxodegradable packaging for Stila baked 
snacks that reduces waste by degrading when exposed to air.  Frito-Lay has partnered with Terracycle to collect and extract materials from its snack chip bags for reuse in other consumer products.  In 2010,  we will launch SunChips 105-ounce bags made from plant-based renewable materials,  which are fully compostable in a hot,  active compost pile.  In the beverage aisle,  consumers are reaching for lighter packaging for Lipton Iced Tea in Russia,  and the new Eco-Fina Bottle of Aquafina water,  which contains 50 percent less plastic than our 2002 
bottle—saving 75 million pounds of plastic each year.  We are leading the industry in the use of post-consumer recycled PET.  We incorporate 10 percent recycled PET content in our carbonated soft drink (CSD) plastic bottles in the United States.  The new 32-ounce bottles of Naked Juice  areNEWabottle" is made from 100 percent post-consumer recycled PET resin,  a first for a nationally distributed brand in the United States.

Every Drop Counts We recognize water as a basic human right.  It is essential to our food and beverage business.  That is why our goal is to achieve positive water balance across all our businesses.  For every liter of water we use,  we intend to return one to the earth.  Our India beverage operations have already met the challenge.  In a region where monsoon rains can provide a much-needed source of water,  our manufacturing plants collect rainwater from their roofs and use it to rejuvenate surrounding aquifers so communities can access safe water and rural farmers can grow more crops.  We are also partnering with nongovernment organizations in such water-stressed regions as India,  China,  Ghana and Brazil to help install irrigation systemsimprove sanitation programs and construct community cisterns.  In addition,  we are also employing a variety of water conservation techniques ourselves—and sharing others with local farmers and communities.  In the United States,  our conservation programs are saving billions of liters of water.  We are cleaning Gatorade bottles with purified air rather than water.  We are using advanced filtration systems to recycle and reuse approximately 80 percent of the processed water used in production at our Frito-Lay facility in Arizona.  In the United Kingdom,  our Walkers business is working to capture the water in potatoes and use it to make our facilities self-sufficient for water.  And in China,  we are pioneering new agricultural methods to reduce the water used to grow the potatoes for Lay is potato chips by more than half.  These efforts are no drop in the bucket.  So far,  we have saved billions of liters of water.  But water will always be scarce,  and we are determined to do more.  Optimizing our efficient use of water is good for people,  good for the planet and good for business.  
Cultivating Local Opportunity At PepsiCo,  our agricultural heritage gives us a healthy respect for the grainsfruits,  vegetables and nuts that deliver great taste and nutrition.  We rely on local farmers to supply our network of global facilities with high-quality fruits and vegetables.  These strong partnerships help us ensure consistent freshness and quality,  increase crop yields,  reduce our carbon footprint and support families and communities.  In Mexico,  Sabritas creates a reliable and sustainable market for small and mid-sized corn farmers.  We invited them 
to become Sabritas supply chain partners and are working with the local Educampo Program to provide the seeds,  fertilizersagrochemicals and water usage guidelines that help farmers produce abundant crops.  This educational,  technical and financial support is enabling 297 producers in poor farming communities to cultivate new economic and social development opportunities while increasing their average crop yield by more than 165 percent.  Similar agricultural programs are reaping positive results in other countries as well.  In Russia,  when the economic 
downturn restricted available creditwe kept local farmers afloat with microcredits,  payments for crops,  seed credits and leases for agricultural machinery.  Our agro-manager teams also consulted with farmers and shared best practices.  And in Inner Mongolia,  China,  we introduced proven environmentally friendly irrigation and crop rotation practices that save water and help local potato farmers grow thriving crops in the middle of the desert.  These farmers are better able to make a sustainable living by selling their crops at competitive prices.  PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
 Big Step Toward a Reduced Carbon Footprint Market leadership is a familiar position for the Tropicana brand.  So it is no surprise that North America is juice leader would also become the first brand in the United States to certify with the Carbon Trust the carbon footprint of a product—in this case a 64-ounce carton of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice.  To measure its footprint,  Tropicana partnered with third-party experts at the Columbia Earth Institute and the Carbon 22 
Trust to study every facet of the product lifecycle—from growing and squeezing oranges to getting the juice to the store shelf.  The analysis found that each halfgallon carton of orange juice generates about 375 pounds (17 kilograms) of total carbon dioxide emissions.  This research is helping the brand improve its agriculturalmanufacturing,  transportation and packaging processes,  all while still delivering a delicious and healthy orange juice.  
We have completed similar projects with other products,  including Walkers Crisps,  which has reduced its carbon footprint by 7 percent since 2007.  Just as consumers can use this data to monitor their own carbon footprints,  we will use it as a benchmark for measuring carbon emissions going forward.  It will also help guide us as we make our operations more energy eﬃcient—and further reduce our environmental footprint.

Reducing Waste We are working to reduce our impact on landfills around the globe.  PepsiCo UK pledged in 2008 to achieve zero landfill waste across its total supply chain within 10 years.  To dateit has focused on reducing waste at its manufacturing sites.  With aggressive programs to recycle and reuse materialseight of these sites in 2009 had already met their goal of zero landfill waste.  The strong support of frontline associates was integral to each plant is successand PepsiCo UK is trying to extend its pledge across its supply chain.  The plants began by appointing marshals to help identify the different waste streams,  oversee correct removal and educate frontline associates on the need to recycle.  In Cupar,  Scotland,  the Quaker Oats factory 
replaced multiple contractors with a single partner who helped guide its waste strategy.  Similar programs are in place in the United States at Quaker,  Tropicana and Frito-Lay,  where the businesses are recycling more byproducts and also promoting household recycling.  Quaker Oats is using 100 percent of the oat,  incorporating oat kernels into whole grain foods while converting the outer hulls of oats into renewable biomass energy.  This practice,  in turn,  keeps waste from the milling process out of local landfills.  Tropicana launched a recycling initiative with Waste Management and its carton suppliers that increased access to curbside recycling of juice cartons nationwide by 26 percent in 2009.  
Quaker is using the power of the oat to fuel a local university.  The Quaker Cedar Rapids plant is converting oat hulls into a biomass alternative energy source that supplies 14 percent of the University of Iowa is power.

Either independently or through contract manufacturers,  we makemarket and sell a variety of convenient,  enjoyable and wholesome foods and beverages.  Our portfolio includes oat,  rice and grainbased snacks,  as well as carbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  in over 200 countries.  Our largest operations are in North America (United States and Canada),  Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Additional information concerning our divisions and geographic areas is presented in Note 1.  We are united by our unique commitment to Performance with Purpose,  which means delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet.  Our goal is to continue to build a balanced portfolio of enjoyable and wholesome foods and beverages,  find innovative ways to reduce the use of energywater and packaging and provide a great workplace for our employees.  Additionally,  we will respect,  support and invest in the local communities where we operate by hiring local peoplecreating products designed for local tastes and partnering with local farmers,  governments and community groups.  We make this commitment because we are a responsible company and a healthier future for all people and our planet means a more successful future for PepsiCo.  And in recognition of our continuing sustainability efforts,  we were again included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in September 2009.  These indices are compiled annually.  Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial conditions.  These indicators include market share,  volume,  net revenue,  operating profit,  management operating cash flow,  earnings per share and return on invested capital.  
Key challenges and Strategies for Driving Growth We remain focused on growing our business with the objectives of improving our financial results and increasing returns for our shareholders.  We continue to focus on delivering top-quartile financial performance in both the near term and the long termwhile making global investments in key regions and targeted product categories to drive sustainable growth.  We have identified the following key challenges and related competitive strategies for driving growth that we believe will enable us to achieve our objectives: 1.  Expand the Global Leadership Position of our Snacks Business Expanding our snacks businesses in developing and emerging markets is important to our growth.  In 2009,  we were the global snacks leader,  with the 1 savory category share position in virtually every key region across the globe.  We had advantaged positions across the entire value chain in more than 40 developed and developing regions in which we operate and were able to capitalize on local manufacturing and optimize go-to-market capabilities in each region,  as well as introduce locally relevant products using global capabilities.  And we have significant growth opportunities as we work to expand our current snacks businesses in these regions,  extend our reach into new geographies and enter adjacent categories.  We also intend to continue to make our core snacks healthier through innovations in heart-healthy oil,  sodium reduction and the addition of whole grains,  nuts and seeds.  2.  Ensure Sustainable,  Profitable Growth in Global Beverages The U.S.  liquid refreshment beverage category and challenging economic conditions facing consumers continue to place pressure on our global beverage business.  In the face of this pressure,  we are taking action to ensure sustainable,  profitable growth in our global beverage business.  We expect that the mergers with PBG and PAS will create a lean,  agile organization in North America with an optimized supply chain,  a flexible go-to-market system and enhanced innovation capabilities.  When combined with the actions we are taking to refresh our brands across the entire beverage category,  we believe this game-changing transaction will enable us to accelerate our top-line growth and also improve our profitability.  There continue to be significant areas of global beverage growthparticularly in developing markets and in evolving categories.  We will invest in those attractive opportunities,  concentrating in geographies and categories in which we are the leader or a close second,  or where the competitive game remains wide open.  Additionally,  we intend to use our research and development capabilities to develop low- and zero-calorie beverages that taste great and add positive nutrition such as fiber,  vitamins and calcium.

Management is Discussion and Analysis 3.  Unleash the Power of 'Power of One" Retail consolidation continues to increase the importance of our key customers.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  as well as retailers and our bottling partnersto effectively compete.  We are in the unique position to leverage two extraordinary consumer categories that have special relevance to retailers across the globe.  Our snacks and beverages are both high velocity categories; both generate retail traffic; both are profitable; and both deliver strong cash flow.  The combination of snacks and beverages—with our 'must have" global and local brands—makes us an essential partner for large-format as well as small-format retailers.  We expect to increasingly use this portfolio and the high coincidence of consumption of these products through integrated offerings (products,  marketing and merchandising) to create value for consumers and deliver greater top-line growth for retailers.  We intend to accelerate Power of One supply chain and back-office synergies in many regions to improve profitability and enhance customer service.  4.  Rapidly Expand our 'Good for You" Portfolio Consumer tastes and preferences are constantly changing and our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trendsincluding responding to consumers' desire for healthier choices.  We currently have a roughly $10 billion core of 'good-for-you" products anchored by: Tropicana,  Naked Juice,  Lebedyansky,  Sandora and our other juice brands; Aquafina; Quaker Oats; Gatorade (for athletes); the new dairy joint venture with Almarai; and local good-foryou products and brands.  We intend to build on this core with an increasing stream of science-based innovation derived from the research and development capabilities that we have been ramping up over the past couple of years,  as well as from targeted acquisitions and joint ventures.  We will be investing to accelerate the growth of these platforms,  and we will use the knowledge from these initiatives to improve our core snack and beverage offerings and also to develop highly nutritious products for undernourished people across the world.  5.  Continue to Deliver on Our Environmental Sustainability Goals and Commitments Consumers and government officials are increasingly focused on the impact companies have on the environment.  We are committed to protecting the earth is natural resources and are well on our way to meeting our public goals for meaningful reductions in waterelectricity and fuel usage.  Our businesses around the world are 
implementing innovative approaches to be significantly more efficient in the use of land,  energy,  water,  and packaging—and we are actively working with the communities in which we operate to be responsive to their resource needs.  In 2009,  we formalized our commitment to water as a human right,  and we will focus not only on world-class efficiency in our operations,  but also in preserving water resources and enabling access to safe water.  Our climate change focus is on reducing our carbon footprint,  including the reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions and continued improvement in energy use efficiency.  We actively work with our farmers to promote sustainable agriculture—and we are developing new packaging alternatives in both snacks and beverages to reduce our impact on the environment.  6.  Cherish our Employees and Develop the Leadership to Sustain Our Growth Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  This will be especially important during 2010 in connection with the integration efforts related to the proposed mergers with PBG and PAS.  We have an extraordinary talent base across our global organization—in our manufacturing facilities,  our sales and distribution organizations,  our marketing groups,  our staff functionsand with our general managers.  As we expand our businesseswe are placing heightened focus on ensuring that we maintain an inclusive environment and on developing the careers of our associates—all with the goal of continuing to have the leadership talent,  capabilities and experience necessary to grow our businesses well into the future.  As an example,  we are implementing tailored training programs to provide our managers and senior executives with the strategic and leadership capabilities required in a rapidly changing environment.  At PepsiCo,  everything we do is underpinned by our commitment to Performance with Purpose.  This means we deliver sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet.  For instance,  in addition to the long-term sustainability and talent-related commitments referenced above,  we also intend to respect,  support and invest in the local communities where we operate by hiring local people,  creating products designed for local tastes and partnering with local farmers,  governments and community groups.  Performance with Purpose has been the fundamental underpinning to our success in 2009 and has been recognized by publications and organizations from Fortune Magazine is

PAB is volume reflects sales to its independent distributors and retailers,  as well as the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that bottlers have reported as sold to independent distributors and retailers.  Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonalitytiming of product launches,  product mix,  bottler inventory practices and other factors.  While our revenues are not based on BCS volume,  we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our products at the consumer level.

For our bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentives,  advertising support,  new product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include coupons,  pricing discounts and promotions,  and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting bottler media.  New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-ofpurchase materials,  product placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  In 2009sales to Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  (Wal-Mart),  including Sam is Club (Sam is),  represented approximately 13% of our total net revenue.  Our top five retail customers represented approximately 33% of our 2009 North American net revenue,  with Wal-Mart (including Sam is) representing approximately 19%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  In addition,  sales to PBG represented approximately 6% of our total net revenue in 2009.  See 'Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG and PAS, " 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 for more information on our anchor bottlers.  Our related Party Bottlers We have ownership interests in certain of our bottlers.  Our ownership is less than 50%,  and since we do not control these bottlers,  we do not consolidate their results.  We have designated three related party bottlers,  PBG,  PAS and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (PBV),  as our anchor bottlers.  We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of economic ownership in our income statement as bottling equity income.  Our anchor bottlers distribute approximately 60% of our North American beverage volume and approximately 16% of our beverage volume outside of North America.  Our anchor bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above.  Approximately 8% of our total 2009 sales incentives were related to these bottlers.  See Note 8 for additional information on

Our share of income or loss from other noncontrolled affiliates is recorded as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  See 'Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG and PAS" for more information on our related party bottlers.  Our DistributiOn netwOrk 
Our products are brought to market through DSD,  customer warehouse and foodservice and vending distribution networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needsproduct characteristics and local trade practices.  Direct-store-Delivery We,  our bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.  DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  Customer warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,  have lower turnover,  and are less likely to be impulse purchases.  Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks,  foods and beverages to third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  Our foodservice and vending sales force also distributes certain beverages through our bottlers.  This distribution system supplies our products to restaurants,  businesses,  schoolsstadiums and similar locations.  Our COmpetitiOn 
Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against global,  regional,  local and private label manufacturers on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  In U.S.  measured channels,  our chief beverage competitor,  The Coca-Cola Company,  has a larger share of CSD consumption,  while we have a larger share of liquid refreshment beverages consumption.  In addition,  The Coca-Cola Company has a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside the United States.  Furtherour snack brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack industry worldwide.  Our snack brands face local,  regional and 
private label competitors,  as well as national and global snack competitors,  and compete on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products,  the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,  marketing programs and product packaging.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketingcoupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network,  allow us to compete effectively.  Other relatiOnships 
Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations.  Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our employees serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental compensation for their Board services.  Our business risks 
Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.  We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits,  we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position.  Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends,  including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness,  obesity,  product attributes and ingredients.  In addition,  changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factorsincluding the aging of the general population,  changes in social trends,  changes in travel,  vacation or leisure activity patterns,  weathernegative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in our industry,  a downturn in economic conditions or taxes specifically targeting the consumption of our products.  Any of these changes may reduce consumers'

Management is Discussion and Analysis willingness to purchase our products.  See also the discussions under 'The global economic downturn has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " and 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activitiesincrease our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovation,  including maintaining a robust pipeline of new productsand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,  marketing programs and product packaging.  Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal,  there can be no assurance as to our continued ability either to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products,  or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  Our failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands,  as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  If we fail to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  including with respect to raw materials obtained from our suppliers,  our reputation could be jeopardized.  Adverse publicity about these types of concerns or the incidence of product contamination or tampering,  whether or not valid,  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumptionmisbranded or causes injury,  we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time,  which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns,  our environmental impacts,  including agricultural materials,  packaging,  energy use and waste management,  or other 
sustainability issues,  could jeopardize our reputation.  In addition,  water is a limited resource in many parts of the world.  Our reputation could be damaged if we do not act responsibly with respect to water use.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  Trade consolidation,  the loss of any key customer,  or failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners could adversely affect our financial performance.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  as well as other retailers and our bottling partners,  to effectively compete.  There is a greater concentration of our customer base around the world generally due to the continued consolidation of retail trade.  As retail ownership becomes more concentrated,  retailers demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  as larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to these trends or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  Loss of any of our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore,  if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottlers through a combination of advertising and marketing support,  they may take actions that,  while maximizing their own short-term profit,  may be detrimental to us or our brands.  Such actions could have an adverse effect on our profitability.  In addition,  any deterioration of our relationships with our bottlers could adversely affect our business or financial performance.  See 'Our Customers, " 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers,  including our anchor bottlers.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
If we are unable to hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce,  it could have a negative impact on our business.  Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  We compete to hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  Furthermore,  if any of our key employees or key employees of either PBG or PAS depart because of issues relating to the PBG Merger and the PAS Merger (as defined in 'Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG and PAS") such as the uncertainty,  difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the post-merger entity,  our ongoing business could be harmed.  In addition,  our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employeeshigher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Our performance could be adversely affected as a result of unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the countries where we operate or if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets.  Our operations outside of the United States contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability.  Unstable political conditionscivil unrest or other developments and risks in the countries where we operate could also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Factors that could adversely affect our business results in these countries include: import and export restrictions; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets; regulations on the repatriation of funds which from time to time result in significant cash balances in countries such as Venezuela; and currency hyperinflation or devaluation.  In additiondisruption in these markets due to political instability or civil unrest could result in a decline in consumer purchasing power,  thereby reducing demand for our products.  We believe that our businesses in developing and emerging markets present an important future growth opportunity for us.  If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging and developing markets for any of the reasons described above,  as a result of increased competition in these countries from multinationals or local competitors,  or for any other reason,  our growth rate could be adversely affected.  See also 'Our performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. " 
Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costsreduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  The conduct of our businesses,  and the production,  distributionsale,  advertising,  labeling,  safety,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate.  These laws and regulations may change,  sometimes dramaticallyas a result of political,  economic or social events.  Such regulatory environment changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to advertising and deceptive marketing practices; accounting standards; taxation requirements,  including taxes specifically targeting the consumption of our products; competition laws; and environmental laws,  including laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment.  Changes in laws,  regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and,  therefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  Governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where we operate may also impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  For example,  studies are underway by various regulatory authorities and others to assess the effect on humans due to acrylamide in the diet.  Acrylamide is a chemical compound naturally formed in a wide variety of foods when they are cooked (whether commercially or at home)including french fries,  potato chips,  cereal,  bread and coffee.  It is believed that acrylamide may cause cancer in laboratory animals when consumed in significant amounts.  If consumer concerns about acrylamide increase as a result of these studies,  other new scientific evidence,  or for any other reason,  whether or not validdemand for our products could decline and we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products,  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are also subject to Proposition 65 in California,  a law which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance listed by that State as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold,  sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may also have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctionswhich could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  See also 'Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance. " If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  successfully implement our ongoing business transformation initiative or outsource certain functions effectively our business could suffer.  We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers,  as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of customers,  business disruptions,  or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We have embarked on a multi-year business transformation initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application,  as well as the migration to common business processes across our operations.  There can be no certainty that these programs will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the application on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue.  In addition,  we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions,  such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration,  to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform effectively,  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers.  Depending on the function involved,  such errors may also lead to business disruption,  processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach,  or harm employee morale.  
Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information,  corrupting information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.  The global economic downturn has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  The global economic downturn has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions in many of the countries in which we operate.  Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these unfavorable economic conditions,  including: adverse changes in interest rates or tax rates; volatile commodity markets; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace potentially impairing our ability to access the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us; the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions; reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down in the general global economy or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons to private label products or to less profitable channels; or a further decrease in the fair value of pension assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension plans.  The global economic downturn has also resulted in increased foreign exchange rate volatility.  We hold assets and incur liabilitiesearn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars.  As a result,  our profitability may be adversely impacted by an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates.  In addition,  we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our critical customers,  suppliers and distributors and any negative impact on our critical customers,  suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Our performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.  The food and beverage industries in which we operate are highly competitive.  We compete with major international food and beverage companies that,  like us,  operate in multiple geographic areas,  as well as regional,  local and private label manufacturers.  In many countries where we do business,  including the United StatesThe Coca-Cola Company,  is our primary beverage competitor.  We compete on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety,  distribution PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
marketing and promotional activity,  and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.  If we are unable to compete effectively,  we may be unable to gain or maintain share of sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets.  This may have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins.  Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs,  disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  We and our business partners use various raw materials and other supplies in our business,  including apple and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates,  aspartame,  corn,  corn sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruits and other fruits,  oats,  orangespotatoes,  rice,  seasonings,  sucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils,  and wheat.  Our key packaging materials include plastic resins including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resin used for plastic beverage bottles,  film packaging used for snack foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles and cardboard.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities due to their use in our plants and in the trucks delivering our products.  Some of these raw materials and supplies are available from a limited number of suppliers.  We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy.  The raw materials and energy which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand,  weather conditions,  agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costs we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating income.  In addition,  we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials.  Certain of these derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.  See also the discussion under 'The global economic downturn has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition., " 'Market Risks" and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  
Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability and that of our suppliers,  business partners,  including bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  independent distributors and retailers,  to make,  move and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to adverse weather conditions,  natural disaster,  fireterrorism,  the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities,  pandemicstrikes and other labor disputes or other reasons beyond our or their control,  could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occur,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Climate change,  or legal,  regulatory or market measures to address climate change,  may negatively affect our business and operations.  There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures,  weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity,  we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our productssuch as sugar cane,  corn,  wheat,  rice,  oats,  potatoes and various fruits.  We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change,  which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.  In additionnatural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.  The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional,  federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases.  In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that currently we are undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency,  we and our bottling partners may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery.  In particular,  increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result,  climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.

Management is Discussion and Analysis Risks RelAting to the MeRgeRs 
Failure to complete the PBg Merger and the PAs Merger may adversely affect our results of operations and prevent us from realizing the full extent of the benefits and cost savings expected from either or both of the PBg Merger and the PAs Merger.  The PBG Merger and the PAS Merger are each subject to the satisfaction or,  to the extent permissible,  waiver of certain conditions,  including,  but not limited to,  receipt of the necessary consents and approvals.  Although we expect to complete both of the Mergers,  it is possible that either the PBG Merger or the PAS Merger may not be completed.  Our relationship with PBG or PAS may suffer following a failure to complete the PBG Merger or the PAS Merger,  as applicable,  which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Failure to complete either Merger will also prevent us from realizing the full extent of the benefits and cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of both Mergers.  See also 'The Mergers are subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on us. " After completion of the Mergers,  we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits expected therefrom,  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock or other securities.  The success of the Mergers will depend,  in part,  on our ability to successfully combine our business with the businesses of PBG and PAS and realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from such combination.  While we believe that these cost savings estimates are achievable,  it is possible that we will be unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame,  or at all.  Our cost savings estimates also depend on our ability to combine our business with the businesses of PBG and PAS in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized.  If these estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to combine our business with the businesses of PBG and PAS successfully,  the anticipated cost savings and other benefits,  including expected synergies,  resulting from the Mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected,  and the value of our common stock or other securities may be adversely affected.  
Specifically,  issues that must be addressed in integrating our operations with the operations of PBG and PAS in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers include,  among other things:  integrating the manufacturing,  distribution,  sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems among the companies;  motivating,  recruiting and retaining executives and key employees;  conforming standards,  controls,  procedures and policiesbusiness cultures and compensation structures among the companies;  consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures;  consolidating sales and marketing operations;  retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;  identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;  coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and  managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of the Mergers.  Delays encountered in the process of integrating our business with the businesses of PBG and PAS could have an adverse effect on our revenues,  expenses,  operating results and financial condition after completion of the Mergers.  Although significant benefits,  such as increased cost savings,  are expected to result from the Mergersthere can be no assurance that we will realize any of these anticipated benefits after completion of either or both of the Mergers.  Additionally,  significant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with consummating the Mergers and integrating the operations of the companies,  with a significant portion of such costs being incurred through the first year after completion of the Mergers.  We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the businesses of PBG and PAS.  Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs,  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses,  will offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time,  no assurances can be given that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term,  or at all.  Furthermore,  the Mergers,  and the related integration effortscould result in the departure of key employees or distract management and employees from delivering against base strategies and objectives,  which could have a negative impact on our business,  andprior to the completion of the Mergers,  the businesses of PBG or PAS.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
The Mergers are subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on us.  Completion of each of the Mergers is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals,  including,  but not limited to,  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (the HSR Act) with respect to such Merger.  There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained,  andadditionally,  government authorities from which these clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the PBG Merger or the PAS Merger or require changes to their respective terms.  While under the terms of the Merger Agreementsneither we nor PBG or PAS is required,  in connection with the PBG Merger or the PAS Merger,  as applicable,  to enter into any agreement or other undertaking with any such governmental authority with respect to any of our respective or our respective material subsidiaries' material businesses,  assets or properties,  we,  PBG and PAS have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain governmental clearances or approvals necessary to complete the applicable Merger.  If,  in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete either the PBG Merger or the PAS Merger,  we become subject to any material conditions after completion of the PBG Merger or PAS Merger,  as applicable,  our business and results of operations after completion of the PBG Merger or PAS Mergeras applicable,  may be adversely affected.  In addition,  there can be no assurances that the Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will approve the consent decree (Consent Decree) we signed that was proposed by the Staff of the FTC.  If the Commissioners do not approve the Consent Decree,  the Mergers could be prevented or delayed.  Following completion of the Mergers,  a greater portion of our workforce will belong to unions.  Failure to successfully renew collective bargaining agreements,  or strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer.  Over 25% of current PBG and PAS employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire on various dates.  Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are 
unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms,  which could adversely impact our operating results.  The terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency after completion of the Mergers.  Any downgrade of our credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs.  Following the public announcement of the PBG Merger Agreement and the PAS Merger Agreement (as defined in 'Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG and PAS"),  Moody is Investors Service (Moody is) indicated that it was reviewing our ratings for possible downgrade.  Moody is has noted that the additional debt involved in completing the Mergers and our consolidated level of indebtedness following completion of the Mergers could result in a rating lower than the current rating level.  Also following the public announcement of the PBG Merger Agreement and the PAS Merger AgreementStandard & Poor is Ratings Services (S&P) indicated that its outlook on PepsiCo was negative and it could lower our ratings.  S&P has indicated that when additional information becomes available S&P will review whether,  following completion of the PBG Merger and the PAS Merger,  any of our senior unsecured debt will,  in S&P is viewbe structurally subordinated,  which could result in a lower rating for PepsiCo is debt securities.  A downgrade by either Moody is or S&P could increase our future borrowing costs.  Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements We discuss expectations regarding our future performance,  such as our business outlook,  in our annual and quarterly reports,  press releases,  and other written and oral statements.  These 'forward-looking statements" are based on currently available information,  operating plans and projections about future events and trends.  They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statements.  Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements,  which speak only as of the date they are made.  We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statementwhether as a result of new information,  future events or otherwise.  The discussion of risks below and elsewhere in this report is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange rates,  and  interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiativesglobal purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  See Note 9 for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.  Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularlyincluding a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk and generally settle with these financial institutions on a net basis.  The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  
Commodity Prices We expect to be able to reduce the impact of volatility in our raw material and energy costs through our hedging strategies and ongoing sourcing initiatives.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $151 million as of December 26,  2009 and $303 million as of December 27,  2008.  These contracts resulted in net unrealized losses of $29 million as of December 26,  2009 and $117 million as of December 27,  2008.  At the end of 2009,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instrumentsassuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2009 by $13 million.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $231 million as of December 26,  2009 and $626 million as of December 27,  2008.  These contracts resulted in net losses of $57 million in 2009 and $343 million in 2008.  At the end of 2009,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net losses in 2009 by $17 million.  Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 48% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising 16% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  During 2009,  net unfavorable foreign currencyprimarily due to depreciation of the Mexican peso,  British poundeuro and Russian ruble,  reduced net revenue growth by 5 percentage points.  Currency declines against the U.S.  dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  In addition,  we continue to use the official exchange rate to translate the financial statements of our snack and beverage businesses in Venezuela.  We use the official rate as we currently intend to remit dividends solely through the government PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI).  As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  the results of our Venezuelan businesses will be reported under hyperinflationary accounting.  This determination was made based upon Venezuela is National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) which indicated cumulative inflation in Venezuela in excess of 100% for the three-year period ended November 30,  2009.  Consequently,  the functional currency of our Venezuelan entities will be changed from the bolivar fuerte (bolivar) to the U.S.  dollar.  Effective January 11,  2010,  the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from 215 bolivars per dollar to 43 bolivars per dollar; howevercertain activities would be permitted to access an exchange rate of 26 bolivars per dollar.  In 2010,  we expect that the majority of our transactions will be conducted at the 43 exchange rate,  and as a result of the change to hyperinflationary accounting and the devaluation of the bolivar,  we expect to record a one-time charge of approximately $125 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In 2009our operations in Venezuela comprised 7% of our cash and cash equivalents balance and generated less than 2% of our net revenue.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  We may enter into derivativesprimarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two yearsto manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $12 billion as of December 26,  2009 and $14 billion as of December 27,  2008.  The contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of $20 million as of December 26,  2009 and net unrealized gains of $111 million as of December 27,  2008.  At the end of 2009,  we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses by $86 million.  The contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net gains of $1 million in 2009 and net losses of $28 million in 2008.  All losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Our interest rate and cross currency swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they modified.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross currency swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  Assuming year-end 2009 variable rate debt and investment levels,  a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $3 million in 2009.  Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives will necessarily involve taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritize,  manage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes:  The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC),  comprised of a crossfunctional,  geographically diverse,  senior management group which meets regularly to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address strategic and reputational risks;  Division Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet regularly to identifyassess,  prioritize and address division-specific operating risks;  PepsiCo is Risk Management Office,  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PRC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties,  as well as to PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors;  PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and  PepsiCo is Compliance Department,  which leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.

Management is Discussion and Analysis OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results.  These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve the choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presentedand have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:  revenue recognition brand and goodwill valuations income tax expense and accruals,  and  pension and retiree medical plans.  REvENUE RECOGNITION 
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally,  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarlyour policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for the products they distribute.  Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In additionDSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  we monitor customer inventory levels.  
As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $129 billion in 2009,  $125 billion in 2008 and $113 billion in 2007.  Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targetsand accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a yearand therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  For interim reporting,  we estimate total annual sales incentives for most of our programs and record a pro rata share in proportion to revenue.  Certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rightsmay extend beyond one year.  Payments made to obtain these rights are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $296 million at year-end 2009 and $333 million at year-end 2008 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,  the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  BRAND AND GOODwILL vALUATIONS 
We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands in acquisitions.  Upon acquisition,  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities,  including brands,  based on estimated fair value,  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill.  Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  such as marketplace participantsproduct life cycles,  market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance,  and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful lives,  which generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including market shareconsumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Perpetual brands and goodwill,  including the goodwill that is part of our noncontrolled bottling investment balances,  are not amortized.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flowsan impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair valuewhich is based on its discounted future cash flows.  Management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations,  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " 
We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  As of December 26,  2009we had $83 billion of perpetual brands and goodwill,  of which approximately 60% related to our Lebedyansky,  Tropicana and Walkers businesses.  Income Tax expense and accruals 
Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  In 2009,  our annual tax rate was 260% compared to 267% in 2008 as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2009 decreased 07 percentage points primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters and lower taxes on foreign results in the current year.  In 2010,  our annual tax rate is expected to be approximately the same as in 2009.

Management is Discussion and Analysis Pension AnD RetiRee MeDicAl PlAns 
Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost.  our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of the benefits that employees earn while workingas well as the present value of those benefits.  Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost),  (2) increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost),  and (3) other gains and losses as discussed below,  reduced by (4) expected return on plan assets for our funded plans.  Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense include:  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);  certain employee-related factors,  such as turnover,  retirement age and mortality;  for pension expense,  the expected return on assets in our funded plans and the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and  for retiree medical expense,  health care cost trend rates.  Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management is best judgment regarding future expectations.  Due to the significant management judgment involved,  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expenses and obligations.  At each measurement date,  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality,  long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities.  Prior to 2008,  we used the Moody is Aa Corporate Bond Index yield in the U.S.  and adjusted for differences between the average duration of the bonds in this Index and the average duration of our benefit liabilities,  based upon a published index.  As of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal 
year,  our U.S.  discount rate is determined using the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (Mercer Yield Curve).  The Mercer Yield Curve uses a portfolio of high-quality bonds rated Aa or higher by Moody is.  The Mercer Yield Curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively-managed securities and is reviewed annually based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditionstolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 89% from our equity allocations and 63% from our fixed income allocations.  Our target investment allocation is 40% for U.S.  equity allocations20% for international equity allocations and 40% for fixed income allocations.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  we use a market-related valuation method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) for securities included in our equity allocations over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  For all other asset categories,  the actual fair value is used for the market-related value of assets.  The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets is added to,  or subtracted fromother gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 12 years for retiree medical expense.  Effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year,  we amended our U.S.  hourly pension plan to increase the amount of participant earnings recognized in determining pension benefits.  Additional pension plan amendments were also made as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year to comply with legislative and regulatory changes.  The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan is liability and expense is reviewed annually.  Our review is based on our claim experience,  information provided by our health plans and actuaries,  and our knowledge of the health care industry.  Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics,  plan design,  new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.  Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: Pension Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Expected rate of salary increases Retiree medical Expense discount rate Current health care cost trend rate 
Based on our assumptions,  we expect our pension expense to increase in 2010,  as a result of assumption changes and an increase in experience loss amortization partially offset by expected asset returns on 2010 contributions.  The most significant assumption changes result from the use of lower discount rates.  Further,  we expect our pension expense to increase in 2010 as a result of our pending mergers with PBG and PAS.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  The estimated impact of a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on 2010 pension expense is an increase of approximately $32 million.  The estimated impact on 2010 pension expense of a 25-basis-point decrease in the expected rate of return is an increase of approximately $20 million.  See Note 7 regarding the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  
Future Funding We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions,  and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible.  Our pension contributions for 2009 were $12 billion,  of which $1 billion was discretionary.  In 2010,  we expect to make contributions of approximately $700 million with up to approximately $600 million expected to be discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical benefits are estimated to be approximately $100 million in 2010.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors,  such as changes in interest rates,  deviations between actual and expected asset returns,  and changes in tax or other benefit laws.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7.  Recent Accounting PRonouncementS 
In December 2007,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its guidance on accounting for business combinations to improve,  simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations.  The new accounting guidance continues the movement toward the greater use of fair value in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures.  We adopted the provisions of the new guidance as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year.  The new accounting guidance changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods.  Additionally,  under the new guidance,  transaction costs are expensed rather than capitalized.  Future adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year apply the new provisions and will be evaluated based on the outcome of these matters.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued new accounting and disclosure guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements.  This guidance amends the accounting literature to establish new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned

Management is Discussion and Analysis Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include energy,  fruit and other raw materials.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2009,  we recognized $274 million ($173 million after-tax or $011 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2008,  we recognized $346 million ($223 million after-tax or $014 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2007,  we recognized $19 million ($12 million after-tax or $001 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  
consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries.  We adopted the accounting provisions of the new guidance on a prospective basis as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year,  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In addition,  we adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements of the new guidance on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2009.  In June 2009,  the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE).  Among other things,  the new guidance requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  In addition,  the amended guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary.  The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal yearand we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.  
OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ITEMS AFFECTINg COMpARAbILITy 
The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items: Operating profit Mark-to-market net impact (gain/(loss) ) Restructuring and impairment charges PBG/PAS merger costs bottling equity income PBG/PAS merger costs Net income attributable to pepsiCo Mark-to-market net impact (gain/(loss) ) Restructuring and impairment charges Tax benefits PepsiCo share of PBG restructuring and impairment charges PBG/PAS merger costs Net income attributable to pepsiCo per common share—diluted Mark-to-market net impact (gain/(loss) ) Restructuring and impairment charges Tax benefits PepsiCo share of PBG restructuring and impairment charges PBG/PAS merger costs 
Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2009,  we incurred a charge of $36 million ($29 million after-tax or $002 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program that began in 2008.  The program includes actions in all divisions of the business,  including the closure of six plants that we believe will increase cost competitiveness across the supply chain,  upgrade and streamline our product portfolio,  and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.  These initiatives were completed in the second quarter of 2009.  In 2008,  we incurred a charge of $543 million ($408 million after-tax or $025 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program.  In 2007,  we incurred a charge of $102 million ($70 million after-tax or $004 per share) in conjunction with restructuring actions primarily to close certain plants and rationalize other production lines.  Tax benefits In 2007,  we recognized $129 million ($008 per share) of non-cash tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters.

PepsiCo Share of PBG is Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2008,  PBG implemented a restructuring initiative across all of its geographic segments.  In addition,  PBG recognized an asset impairment charge related to its business in Mexico.  Consequentlya non-cash charge of $138 million was included in bottling equity income ($114 million after-tax or $007 per share) as part of recording our share of PBG is financial results.  PBG/PAS Merger Costs In 2009,  we incurred $50 million of costs associated with the proposed mergers with PBG and PAS,  as well as an additional $11 million of costs,  representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS,  recorded in bottling equity income.  In total,  these costs had an after-tax impact of $44 million or $003 per share.

In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit beloweffective net pricing reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions,  sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.  Additionally,  acquisitions reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity,  including the impact of acquisitions,  divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries.  The impact of acquisitions related to our non-consolidated equity investees is reflected in our volume and,  excluding our anchor bottlers,  in our operating profit.  Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e.,  kilos,  gallons,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  In 2009,  total servings increased slightly compared to 2008as servings for snacks increased 1% while servings for beverages decreased 1%.  In 2008,  total servings increased 3% compared to 2007as servings for both snacks and beverages worldwide grew 3%.  
2009 Total operating profit increased 16% and operating margin increased 25 percentage points.  These increases were driven by the net favorable mark-to-market impact of our commodity hedges and lower restructuring and impairment charges related to our Productivity for Growth program,  collectively contributing 17 percentage points to operating profit growth,  partially offset by 1 percentage point from costs associated with the proposed mergers with PBG and PAS.  Foreign currency reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points,  and acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to the operating profit growth.  Other corporate unallocated expenses increased 21%,  primarily reflecting deferred compensation losses,  compared to gains in the prior year.  The deferred compensation losses are offset (as an increase to interest income) by gains on investments used to economically hedge these costs.  2008 Total operating profit decreased 3% and margin decreased 21 percentage points.  The unfavorable net mark-to-market impact of our commodity hedges and increased restructuring and impairment charges contributed 11 percentage points to the operating profit decline and 18 percentage points to the margin decline.  Leverage from the revenue growth was offset by the impact of higher commodity costs.  Acquisitions and foreign currency each positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance.

Management is Discussion and Analysis Other corporate unallocated expenses decreased 16%.  The favorable impact of certain employee-related items,  including lower deferred compensation and pension costs were partially offset by higher costs associated with our global SAP implementation and increased research and development costs.  The decrease in deferred compensation costs are offset by a decrease in interest income from losses on investments used to economically hedge these costs.  Other Consolidated Results 2009

Bottling equity income includes our share of the net income or loss of our anchor bottlers as described in 'Our Customers. " Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time.  Any gains or losses from these changes,  as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments,  are also included on a pre-tax basis.  In November 2007,  our Board of Directors approved the sale of additional PBG stock to an economic ownership level of 35%,  as well as the sale of PAS stock to the ownership level at the time of the merger with Whitman Corporation in 2000 of about 37%.  Consequently,  we sold 88 million shares of PBG stock and 33 million shares of PAS stock in 2008.  The resulting lower ownership percentages reduced the equity income from PBG and PAS that we recognized subsequent to those sales.  We did not sell any PBG or PAS stock in 2009.  Substantially all of our bottling equity income is derived from our equity investments in PBG and PAS.  Also see 'Acquisition of Common Stock of PBG and PAS. " 2009 Bottling equity income decreased 2%,  primarily reflecting pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG and PAS stock in the prior year,  mostly offset by a prior year non-cash charge of $138 million related to our share of PBG is 2008 restructuring and impairment charges.  Net interest expense increased $42 million,  primarily reflecting lower average rates on our investment balances and higher average debt balances.  This increase was partially offset by gains in the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs.  
The tax rate decreased 07 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters and lower taxes on foreign results in the current year.  Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 16% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 17%.  The favorable net mark-to-market impact of our commodity hedges and lower restructuring and impairment charges in the current year were partially offset by the PBG/PAS merger costs; these items affecting comparability increased net income attributable to PepsiCo by 16 percentage points and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 17 percentage points.  Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share was also favorably impacted by share repurchases in the prior year.  2008 Bottling equity income decreased 33%,  primarily reflecting a non-cash charge of $138 million related to our share of PBG is restructuring and impairment charges.  Additionally,  lower pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock contributed to the decline.  Net interest expense increased $189 million,  primarily reflecting higher average debt balances and losses on investments used to economically hedge our deferred compensation costs,  partially offset by lower average rates on our borrowings.  The tax rate increased 09 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily due to $129 million of tax benefits recognized in the prior year related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters,  partially offset by lower taxes on foreign results in the current year.  Net income attributable to PepsiCo decreased 9% and the related net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share decreased 6%.  The unfavorable net mark-to-market impact of our commodity hedges,  the absence of the tax benefits recognized in the prior year,  our increased restructuring and impairment charges and our share of PBG is restructuring and impairment charges collectively contributed 15 percentage points to both the decline in net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share.  Additionally,  net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share was favorably impacted by our share repurchases.

Our Liquidity and CapitaL resOurCes 
Global capital and credit markets,  including the commercial paper markets,  experienced considerable volatility in 2009.  This volatility did not have a material unfavorable impact on our liquidity,  and we continue to have access to the capital and credit markets.  In addition,  we have revolving credit facilities that are discussed in Note 9.  We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition,  together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing,  will be adequate to meet our operating,  investing and financing needs.  However,  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  See also 'The global economic downturn has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " and 'Any downgrade of our credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs. " in 'Our Business Risks. " In addition,  currency restrictions enacted by the government in Venezuela have impacted our ability to pay dividends from our snack and beverage operations in Venezuela outside of the country.  As of December 26,  2009,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 7% of our cash and cash equivalents balance.  Furthermore,  our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.  On a continuing basis,  we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results,  including acquisitions,  divestituresjoint ventures and share repurchases.  These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.  Operating activities In 2009,  our operations provided $68 billion of cash,  compared to $70 billion in the prior year,  reflecting a $10 billion ($06 billion after-tax) discretionary pension contribution to our U.S.  pension plans,  $196 million of restructuring payments related to our Productivity for Growth program and $49 million of PBG/PAS merger cost payments.  Operating cash flow also reflected net favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.  In 2008,  our operations provided $70 billion of cash,  compared to $69 billion in the prior year,  primarily reflecting our solid business results.  Our operating cash flow in 2008 reflects restructuring 
payments of $180 million,  including $159 million related to our Productivity for Growth program,  and pension and retiree medical contributions of $219 million,  of which $23 million were discretionary.  investing activities In 2009,  net cash used for investing activities was $24 billionprimarily reflecting $21 billion for capital spending and $05 billion for acquisitions.  In 2008,  we used $27 billion for our investing activities,  primarily reflecting $24 billion for capital spending and $19 billion for acquisitions.  Significant acquisitions included our joint acquisition with PBG of Lebedyansky in Russia and the acquisition of a snacks company in Serbia.  The use of cash was partially offset by net proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $13 billion and proceeds from sales of PBG and PAS stock of $358 million.  We anticipate net capital spending of about $36 billion in 2010.  Additionally,  in connection with our December 7,  2009 agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group,  Inc.  (DPSG) to manufacture and distribute certain DPSG products in the territories where they are currently sold by PBG and PAS,  we will make an upfront payment of $900 million to DPSG upon closing of the proposed mergers with PBG and PAS.  Financing activities In 2009,  net cash used for financing activities was $25 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $27 billion.  Net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $08 billion and stock option proceeds of $04 billion were mostly offset by net repayments of short-term borrowings of $10 billion.  In 2008,  we used $30 billion for our financing activities,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through common share repurchases of $47 billion and dividend payments of $25 billion.  The use of cash was partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt,  net of payments,  of $31 billion,  stock option proceeds of $620 million and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $445 million.  Subsequent to year-end 2009,  we issued $425 billion of fixed and floating rate notes.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to finance a portion of the purchase price for the PBG and PAS mergers and to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the mergers.  See Note 9 for further information regarding financing in connection with the PBG and PAS mergers.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis We annually review our capital structure with our Boardincluding our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  In the second quarter of 2009,  our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase from $170 to $180 per share.  We did not repurchase any shares in 2009 under our $80 billion repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2007 and expiring on June 30,  2010.  The current $80 billion authorization has approximately $64 billion remaining for repurchase.  We anticipate that in 2010 share repurchases together with a voluntary $600 million pre-tax pension plan contribution will total about $5 billion.  
In 2009,  management operating cash flow was used primarily to pay dividends.  In 2008 and 2007,  management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return approximately all of our management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  However,  see 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.  
Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value,  and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  it is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Therefore,  this measure is not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP cash flow measures.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  Additionally,  we consider certain items,  including the impact of a discretionary pension contribution in the first quarter of 2009,  net of tax,  restructuring-related cash payments,  net of tax,  and PBG/PAS merger cost payments in 2009 in evaluating management operating cash flow.  We believe investors should consider these items in evaluating our management operating cash flow results.  The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities,  as reflected in our cash flow statement,  to our management operating cash flow excluding the impact of the above items.  Net cash provided by operating activities Capital spending Sales of property,  plant and equipment Management operating cash flow Discretionary pension contribution (after-tax) Restructuring payments (after-tax) PBG/PAS merger cost payments Management operating cash flow excluding above items 
Credit Ratings Our objective is to maintain short-term credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates.  As anticipated,  following the public announcement of the PBG Merger Agreement and the PAS Merger Agreement,  Moody is indicated that it was reviewing our ratings for possible downgrade and S&P indicated that its outlook on PepsiCo was negative and it could lower our ratings.  Moody is has noted that the additional debt involved in completing the PBG Merger and the PAS Merger and our consolidated level of indebtedness following completion of the PBG Merger and the PAS Merger could result in a rating lower than the current rating level.  S&P has indicated that when additional information becomes available,  S&P will review whether,  following completion of the PBG Merger and the PAS Merger,  any of our senior unsecured debt will,  in S&P is viewbe structurally subordinated,  which could result in a lower rating for PepsiCo is debt.  Our current long-term debt rating is Aa2 at Moody is and A+ at S&P.  We have maintained strong investment grade ratings for over a decade.  Each rating is considered strong investment grade and is in the first quartile of its respective ranking system.  These ratings also reflect the impact of our anchor bottlers' cash flows and debt.  See also 'Our Business Risks. " Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 9 for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  However,  at the time of the separation of our bottling operations from us,  various guarantees were necessary to facilitate the separation.  In 2008,  we extended our guarantee of a portion of Bottling Group LLC is long-term debt in connection with the refinancing of a corresponding portion of the underlying debt.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
As of December 26,  2009,  we believe it is remote that these guarantees would require any cash payment.  Neither the merger with PBG nor the merger with PAS will affect our guarantee of a portion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt.  We do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing or disclosing assets or liabilities.  See Note 9 for a description of our off-balance-sheet arrangements.  Acquisition of common stock of PBG And PAs 
On August 3,  2009,  we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with PBG and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling CompanyInc.  (Metro),  our wholly owned subsidiary (the PBG Merger Agreement) and a separate Agreement and Plan of Merger with PAS and Metro (the PAS Merger Agreement).

On February 17,  2010,  the stockholders of PBG and PAS approved the PBG and PAS Mergers,  respectively.  Consummation of each of the Mergers is subject to various conditions,  including the absence of legal prohibitions and the receipt of regulatory approvals.  On February 17,  2010,  we announced that we had refiled under the HSR Act with respect to the Mergers and signed a Consent Decree proposed by the Staff of the FTC providing for the maintenance of the confidentiality of certain information we will obtain from DPSG in connection with the manufacture and distribution of certain DPSG products after the Mergers are completed.  The Consent Decree is subject to review and approval by the Commissioners of the FTC.  We hope to consummate the Mergers by the end of February,  2010.  We currently plan that at the closing of the Mergers we will form a new operating unit.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions BaSiS oF PreSeNtatioN 
Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In addition,  we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our economic ownership interest.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Equity income or loss from our anchor bottlers is recorded as bottling equity income in our income statement.  Bottling equity income also includes any changes in our ownership interests of our anchor bottlers.  Bottling equity income includes $147 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG and PAS stock in 2008 and $174 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock in 2007.  There were no sales of PBG or PAS stock in 2009.  See Notes 8 and 15 for additional information on our significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Income or loss from other noncontrolled affiliates is recorded as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each Decemberresulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilitiesare included in cost of sales.  The costs of moving,  storing and delivering finished product are included in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accrualstax reserves,  stock-based compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brandsgoodwill and other long-lived assets.  We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis using our historical experience,  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstancessuch as current economic conditions,  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change.  As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  While the majority of our results are reported on a weekly calendar basis,  most of our international operations report on a 
monthly calendar basis.  The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule: Quarter

Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless noted,  and are based on unrounded amounts.

We manufacture or use contract manufacturers,  market and sell a variety of salty,  convenient,  sweet and grain-based snackscarbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  and foods in over 200 countries with our largest operations in North America (United States and Canada),  Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions.  For additional unaudited information on our divisionssee 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2except for the following allocation methodologies:  stock-based compensation expense pension and retiree medical expense,  and  derivatives.  Stock-Based Compensation expense Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2009 was approximately 27% to FLNA,  3% to QFNA,  6% to LAF,  21% to PAB,  13% to Europe,  13% to AMEA and 17% to corporate unallocated expenses.  We had similar allocations of stock-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2008 and 2007.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at a fixed discount rate,  as well as amortization of gains and losses due to demographicsincluding salary experience,  are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costsmeasured at a fixed discount rate,  for retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension plans,  pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding,  and gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  In addition,  corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the Plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7.  
with the resulting gains and losses reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.  In 2007,  we expanded our commodity hedging program to include derivative contracts used to mitigate our exposure to price changes associated with our purchases of fruit.  In addition,  in 2008we entered into additional contracts to further reduce our exposure to price fluctuations in our raw material and energy costs.  The majority of these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results.  
Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include energy,  fruit and other raw materials.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market

Note 2 Our Significant Accounting Policies ReveNue RecogNitioN 
We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-ofdate products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customers,  Wal-Mart and PBG.  In 2009,  Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 13% of our total net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart; and PBG represented approximately 6%.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  SaleS iNceNtiveS aNd otheR MaRketplace SpeNdiNg 
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to our customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $129 billion in 2009,  $125 billion in 2008 and $113 billion in 2007.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rightsmay extend beyond one year.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $296 million as of December 26,  2009 and $333 million as of December 27,  2008 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Other marketplace spending,  which includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities,  totaled $28 billion in 2009 and $29 billion in both 2008 and 2007 and is reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Included in these amounts were advertising expenses of $17 billion in both 2009 
and 2008 and $18 billion in 2007.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:  media and personal service prepayments promotional materials in inventory,  and  production costs of future media advertising.  Deferred advertising costs of $143 million and $172 million at year-end 2009 and 2008,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  diStRibutioN coStS 
Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $56 billion in both 2009 and 2008 and $52 billion in 2007.  caSh equivaleNtS 
Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less which we do not intend to rollover beyond three months.  SoftwaRe coStS 
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software,  (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which approximate five to ten years.  Software amortization totaled $119 million in 2009$58 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $11 billion as of December 26,  2009 and $940 million as of December 27,  2008.  coMMitMeNtS aNd coNtiNgeNcieS 
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  certain taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9.

We engage in a variety of research and development activities.  These activities principally involve the development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing productsimprovement and modernization of production processes,  and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $414 million in 2009$388 million in 2008 and $364 million in 2007 and are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  otheR SigNiFiCaNt aCCouNtiNg poliCieS

In December 2007,  the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for business combinations to improve,  simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations.  The new accounting guidance continues the movement toward the greater use of fair value in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures.  We adopted the provisions of the new guidance as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year.  The new accounting guidance changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods.  Additionally,  under the new guidance,  transaction costs are expensed rather than 
capitalized.  Future adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year apply the new provisions and will be evaluated based on the outcome of these matters.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued new accounting and disclosure guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements.  This guidance amends the accounting literature to establish new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries.  We adopted the accounting provisions of the new guidance on a prospective basis as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year,  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In addition,  we adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements of the new guidance on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2009.  In June 2009,  the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.  Among other things,  the new guidance requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  In addition,  the amended guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary.  The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.  
In 2009,  we incurred a charge of $36 million ($29 million after-tax or $002 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program that began in 2008.  The program includes actions in all divisions of the business,  including the closure of six plants that we believe will increase cost competitiveness across the supply chain,  upgrade and streamline our product portfolio,  and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.  These charges were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  These initiatives were completed in the second quarter of 2009,  and substantially all cash payments related to these charges are expected to be paid by 2010.

Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years,  based on existing intangible assets as of December 26,  2009 and using average 2009 foreign exchange rates,  is expected to be $65 million in both 2010 and 2011,  $61 million in 2012,  $58 million in 2013 and $52 million in 2014.  PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairmentthe asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on discounted future cash flows.  Useful lives are 
periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.  For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  No impairment charges resulted from these impairment evaluations.  The change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets is as follows: BalanceBeginning 2008

For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies,  including our reserves for income taxes,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  In 2007,  we recognized $129 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters.  ReseRves 
 number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:  U.S. —continue to dispute one matter related to tax years 1998 through 2002.  Our U.S.  tax returns for the years 2003 through 2005 are currently under audit.  In 2008,  the IRS initiated its audit of our U.S.  tax returns for the years 2006 through 2007;  Mexico—audits have been substantially completed for all taxable years through 2005;  United Kingdom—audits have been completed for all taxable years prior to 2007; and  Canada—audits have been completed for all taxable years through 2006.  The Canadian tax return for 2007 is currently under audit.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results. " As of December 26,  2009,  the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilities,  was $17 billion.  Any prospective adjustments to these reserves will be recorded as an increase or decrease to our provision for income taxes and would impact our effective tax rate.  In addition,  we accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The gross amount of interest accruedreported in other liabilities,  was $461 million as of December 262009,  of which $30 million was recognized in 2009.  The gross amount of interest accrued was $427 million as of December 272008,  of which $95 million was recognized in 2008.  PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report

Operating loss carryforwards totaling $64 billion at year-end 2009 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $02 billion in 2010,  $55 billion between 2011 and 2029 and $07 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As of December 26,  2009,  we had approximately $219 billion of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  thereforehave not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  
Note 6 Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  A majority of our employees participate in our stock-based compensation program.  This program includes both our broadbased SharePower program which was established in 1989 to grant an annual award of stock options to eligible employeesbased upon job level or classification and tenure (internationally)as well as our executive long-term awards program.  Stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)our only active stock-based plan.  Stock-based compensation expense was $227 million in 2009,  $238 million in 2008 and $260 million in 2007.  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $67 million in 2009,  $71 million in 2008 and 
$77 million in 2007.  Stock-based compensation cost capitalized in connection with our ongoing business transformation initiative was $2 million in 2009,  $4 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007.  At year-end 2009,  42 million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.  Method oF aCCoUNtiNg aNd oUr aSSUMptioNS 
We account for our employee stock options,  which include grants under our executive program and our broad-based SharePower program,  under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  We do not backdate,  reprice or grant stock-based compensation awards retroactively.  Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% performance-based RSUs.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Each RSU is settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.  Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: Expected life Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.  Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income,  share repurchases and stock price.

note 7 Pension,  Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the costs.  Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions,  including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets,  and from changes in our assumptions are also determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/ (credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 12 years for retiree medical expense.  Our adoption of the standard on accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans required that,  no later than 2008,  our assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense be determined as of the balance sheet date,  and all plan assets and liabilities be reported as of that date.  Accordingly,  as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year,  we changed the measurement date for our annual pension and retiree medical expense and all plan assets and liabilities from September 30 to our year-end balance sheet date.  As a result of this change in measurement date,  we recorded an after-tax $39 million decrease to 2008 opening shareholders' equity,  as follows:

Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: Pension Retiree medical(a) 
(a)	 Expected	future	benefit	payments	for	our	retiree	medical	plans	do	not	reflect	any	estimated	 subsidies	expected	to	be	received	under	the	2003	Medicare	Act. 	Subsidies	are	expected	to	be	 approximately	$10	million	for	each	of	the	years	from	2010	through	2014	and	approximately	 $70	million	in	total	for	2015	through	2019.  
These future benefits to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded pension plans.  In 2010,  we will make pension contributions of approximately $700 million,  with up to approximately $600 million expected to be discretionary.  Our net cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be approximately $100 million in 2010.  PeNSioN aSSetS 
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of activelymanaged securities and is reviewed annually based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 89% from our equity allocation and 63% from our fixed income allocation.  Our target investment allocation is 40% for U.S.  equity allocations,  20% for international equity allocations and 40% for fixed income 
allocations.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  we use a market-related valuation method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) for securities included in our equity strategies over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  For all other asset categories,  the actual fair value is used for the market-related value of assets.  We adopted the new accounting guidance on employer is disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets which requires that we categorize pension assets into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets.  Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value,  whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.  The three levels are defined as follows:  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.   Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1.  For example,  quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets.   Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset.

SavIngS Plan 
Our U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings planswhich are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement.  We make matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  In 2009 and 2008,  our matching contributions were $72 million and $70 million,  respectively.

An average increase of 75% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2010.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2014 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability.  However,  the cap on our share of 
Our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates are PBG and PAS.  Sales to PBG represented approximately 6% of our total net revenue in 2009 and 7% of our total net revenue in both 2008 and 2007.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Our investment in PBG,  which includes the related goodwillwas $463 million and $536 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets less noncontrolling interests at year-end 2009 and 2008,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year-end 2009,  the calculated market value of our shares in PBG exceeded our investment balance,  excluding our investment in Bottling Group,  LLC,  by approximately $14 billion.  Additionally,  in 2007,  we formed a joint venture with PBGcomprising our concentrate and PBG is bottling businesses in Russia.  PBG holds a 60% majority interest in the joint venture and consolidates the entity.  We account for our interest of 40% under the equity method of accounting.  During 2008,  together with PBG,  we jointly acquired Russia is leading branded juice company,  Lebedyansky.  Lebedyansky is owned 25% and 75% by PBG and us,  respectively.  See Note 14 for further information on this acquisition.  PePSiAmeriCAS

Our investment in PAS,  which includes the related goodwillwas $322 million and $318 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets less noncontrolling interests at year-end 2009 and 2008,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year-end 2009,  the calculated market value of our shares in PAS exceeded our investment balance by approximately $515 million.  Additionally,  in 2007,  we completed the joint purchase of Sandora,  LLC,  a juice company in the Ukraine,  with PAS.  PAS holds a 60% majority interest in the joint venture and consolidates the entity.  We account for our interest of 40% under the equity method of accounting.  
Our significant related party transactions are with our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  The transactions primarily consist of (1) selling concentrate to these affiliates,  which they use in the production of CSDs and non-carbonated beverages,  (2) selling certain finished goods to these affiliates,  (3) receiving royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products and (4) paying these affiliates to act as our manufacturing and distribution agent for product associated with our national account fountain customers.  Sales of concentrate and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding.  For further unaudited information on these bottlers,  see 'Our Customers" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows: Net revenue Cost of sales Selling,  general and administrative expenses Accounts and notes receivable Accounts payable and other liabilities 
Such amounts are settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables.  See Note 9 regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt.  We also coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the contract negotiations of sweeteners and other raw material requirements for certain of our bottlers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting partywe could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  In addition,  our joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks sell finished goods (ready-to-drink teas,  coffees and water products) to our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Consistent with accounting for equity method investmentsour joint venture revenue is not included in our consolidated net revenue and therefore is not included in the above table.

In the first quarter of 2009,  we issued $10 billion of senior unsecured notes,  bearing interest at 375% per year and maturing in 2014.  We used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes.  In the third quarter of 2009,  we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement which enables us to borrow up to $1975 billion,  subject to customary terms and conditions,  and expires in June 2010.  We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year,  which would mature no later than June 2011.  This agreement replaced a $18 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement we entered into during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Funds borrowed under this agreement may be used to repay outstanding commercial paper issued by us or our subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes,  including working capital,  capital investments and acquisitions.  This agreement is in addition to our existing $20 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in 2012.  Our lines of credit remain unused as of December 26,  2009.  In addition,  as of December 26,  2009,  $396 million of our debt related to borrowings from various lines of credit that are maintained for our international divisions.  These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed to the extent of our borrowings.  
Subsequent to year-end 2009,  we issued $425 billion of fixed and floating rate notes.  The issuance was comprised of $125 billion of floating rate notes maturing in 2011 (the '2011 Floating Rates Notes"),  $10 billion of 310% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2015,  $10 billion of 450% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2020 and $10 billion of 550% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2040.  The 2011 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ('LIBOR") plus 3 basis points.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to finance a portion of the purchase price for the mergers with PBG and PAS and to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the mergers with PBG and PAS.  Pending such use we invested the net proceeds in short-term,  high-quality securities.  If one or both of the mergers with PBG and PAS is not completed,  we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes,  which may include the financing of future acquisitionscapital expenditures,  additions to working capital,  repurchaserepayment or refinancing of debt or stock repurchases.  Concurrently with the debt issuance after year-end,  we terminated the commitments from lenders to provide us with up to $40 billion in bridge financing to fund the mergers with PBG and PAS.  Also subsequent to year-end 2009,  we entered into amendments to PBG is revolving credit facility (the Amended PBG Credit Facility) and PAS is revolving credit facility (the Amended PAS Credit Facility).  Under the Amended PBG Credit Facility,  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to effectiveness,  at the closing of the merger with PBG,  Metro will be able to borrow up to $1080 million from time to time.  Borrowings under the Amended PBG Credit Facility,  which expires in October 2012,  are guaranteed by us.  Under the Amended PAS Credit Facility,  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to effectiveness,  at the closing of the merger with PAS,  Metro will be able to borrow up to $540 million from time to time.  Borrowings under the Amended PAS Credit Facility,  which expires in June 2011,  are guaranteed by us.

It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  Howeverat the time of the separation of our bottling operations from us various guarantees were necessary to facilitate the transactions.  We have guaranteed an aggregate of $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt ($10 billion of which matures in 2012 and $13 billion of which matures in 2014).  In the first quarter of 2009,  we extended our guarantee of $13 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt in connection with the refinancing of a corresponding portion of the underlying debt.  The terms of our Bottling Group,  LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the structure of PBG is separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling Group,  LLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed.  Neither the merger with PBG nor the merger with PAS will trigger our payment obligation under our guarantee of a portion of Bottling Group,  LLC is debt.  As of December 26,  2009,  we believe it is remote that these guarantees would require any cash payment.  See Note 8 regarding contracts related to certain of our bottlers.  
See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Note 10 Financial Instruments In March 2008,  the FASB issued new disclosure guidance on derivative instruments and hedging activities,  which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of previously issued guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesto provide an enhanced understanding of the use of derivative instruments,  how they are accounted for and their effect on financial position,  financial performance and cash flows.  We adopted the disclosure provisions of the new guidance in the first quarter of 2009.  We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy foreign exchange risks,  and  interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a result,  any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  Ineffectiveness of our hedges is not material.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
gain or loss and then include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction,  we recognize the related gain or loss in net income immediately.  We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly,  including a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk and generally settle with these financial institutions on a net basis.  Commodity PriCes 
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders,  pricing agreements,  geographic diversity and derivatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for natural gas and diesel fuel.  For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 monthswe expect to reclassify net losses of $124 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market each period and reflected in our income statement.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $151 million as of December 26,  2009 and $303 million as of December 27,  2008.  These contracts resulted in net unrealized losses of $29 million as of December 26,  2009 and $117 million as of December 27,  2008.  
Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $231 million as of December 26,  2009 and $626 million as of December 27,  2008.  These contracts resulted in net losses of $57 million in 2009 and $343 million in 2008.  Foreign exChange 
Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 48% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising 16% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  On occasion,  we may enter into derivatives,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $12 billion as of December 26,  2009 and $14 billion as of December 27,  2008.  The contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized losses of $20 million as of December 26,  2009 and net unrealized gains of $111 million as of December 27,  2008.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $20 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  The contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net gain of $1 million in 2009 and net losses of $28 million in 2008.  All losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  interest rates 
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swaps,  cross currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2009 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Our interest rate and cross currency swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they modify.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross currency swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  The notional amounts of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 26,  2009 and December 27,  2008 were $575 billion and $275 billion,  respectively.  For those interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accountingany ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these interest rate derivative instruments consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $6 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Concurrently with the debt issuance after year-end,  we terminated $15 billion of interest rate derivative instruments,  and the realized loss will be amortized into interest expense over the duration of the debt term.  As of December 26,  2009,  approximately 57% of total debtafter the impact of the related interest rate derivative instrumentswas exposed to variable rates compared to 58% as of December 272008.  In addition to variable rate long-term debt,  all debt with maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.  Fair Value MeaSureMeNtS 
In September 2006,  the FASB issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurements,  which defines fair value,  establishes a framework for measuring fair value,  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  We adopted the new guidance as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year as it relates to recurring financial assets and liabilities.  As of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal yearwe adopted the new guidance as it relates to nonrecurring fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and 
liabilities.  These include goodwill,  other nonamortizable intangible assets and unallocated purchase price for recent acquisitions which are included within other assets.  Our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  See Note 7 for the fair value framework.

Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 390 million shares in 2009,  98 million shares in 2008 and 27 million shares in 2007 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.  Out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $6152 in 2009,  $6759 in 2008 and $6518 in 2007.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
