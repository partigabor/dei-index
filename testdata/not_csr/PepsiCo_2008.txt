PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Indra K.  Nooyi Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Dear Fellow ShareholdersIt is now two years since we introduced a new strategic mission to try to capture the heart and soul of PepsiCo.  The simple but powerful idea of Performance with Purpose combines the two things that define what we do—growing the business,  and acting as ethical and responsible citizens of the world.  	 As I look back on 2008,  I'm proud to report that Performance with Purpose is woven into the fabric of our company.  Wherever we see success,  we see both parts of our mission in action.  
 PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
All over the world,  whether it is Cedar Rapids or Calgary,  Shanghai or São Paulo,  Mexico CityMoscow or Mumbai,  our associates draw strength and inspiration from this shared mission.  This year is annual report brings some of their stories to life.  It shows how performance and purpose combine to great effect in everything we do.  	 When times are tough it is especially important to be clear about your mission.  By any measure,  2008 was a year of extremes,  an incredibly volatile year.  	 Easy credit turned into a credit crunch that left many businesses and consumers strapped for cash.  The global economy lurched rapidly into recession.  Oil prices approached $150 a barrel before returning back below $40.  Corn,  sugar,  oats and other key commod­ ities saw significant price swings throughout the year.  Global business was made harder by foreign exchange rates that fluctuated,  at times wildly.  The Dow Jones Index began 2008 above 13000 and ended the year below 9000.  That dragged down even the strongest companies' stock—including PepsiCo shares.  	 All told,  I can't recall a more eventful or trying year.  Not that I think pessimism is in order.  The ingenuity of our company showed through again.  All our teams of extraordinary people applied their can-do spirit and must-do sense of responsibility to meet the economic and market challenges head on.  	 As a result,  PepsiCo performed slightly better for the year than both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.  I believe that is because,  while we can't control market volatility,  we remained focused on our strategies for growth,  and that is why our underlying businesses continued to perform very well in 2008.  	 We increased our dividend,  continued our share repurchase program and positioned ourselves for even stronger performance as economic conditions improve.  	 	 Net revenue grew 10%.  	 	 Core division operating profit grew 6%. * 	 	 Cash flow from operations was $7 billion.  	 	 Core return on invested capital was 29%.  	 	 Core EPS grew 9%. *

	 In PepsiCo Americas Foods we had another year of strong growth to both the top and the bottom lines.  That is testament to our strong brands and our efficient go-to-market systems.  This year brought unprece­ dented cost inflation,  but we carefully adjusted our pricing and the weights and package formats across our brands to find the right solution for each channeleach market,  each customer and each consumer.  The year presented some other unexpected problems that we coped with well.  Our flagship Quaker plant in Cedar Rapids,  Iowa,  experienced a major flood but returned to normal production levels by year-end.  In Latin America,  our Brazil snacks business overcame a fire at one of our major plants to perform really well.  We also refreshed the product portfolio.  Frito-Lay North America introduced TrueNorth nut snacks and entered a joint venture that offers Sabra refrigerated dips.  Some of our established products powered on.  The Quaker business and our market-leading Sabritas and Gamesa brands helped us generate tremendous growth.  On these strengths,  PepsiCo Americas Foods increased revenues by 11 percent and core operating profit by 10 percent. * 	 PepsiCo Americas Beverages had a difficult year.  In North America,  our beverage volume was not immune to the overall category weakness triggered by the weak U.S.  economy.  As a result,  PepsiCo Americas Beverages revenues declined by 1 percent and core operating profit fell by 7 percent. * But PepsiCo has proved time and again our skill in anticipating and responding to market changes and consumer preferences.  Liquid refreshment beverages in the United States declined in 2008 for the first time in more than 50 years.  We acted quickly and decisively to refresh the category.  We refreshed the look of our iconic brands Pepsi-Cola,  Mtn DewSierra Mist and Gatorade.  In Latin America,  where we achieved strong results,  we introduced SoBe Lifethe world is first beverage made with PureViaTM,  an all-natural,  zero-calorie sweetener; and early in 2009we launched SoBe Lifewater with PureVia in the United States.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
	 We are investing aggressively to keep our total beverage portfolio relevant to consumers of all ages.  In non-carbonated beverages,  we are working to deliver the right value for the money,  to identify untapped thirst occasions and to deliver even more health benefits.  We added vitamins to our Gatorade sublines; and this year we will introduce a new Trop50 orange juice beverage,  with half the calories of orange juice,  great nutritional benefits and the natural sweetness of PureVia.  	 We have a great portfolio that gives us all confidence.  And we have reexamined how that portfolio connects with today is world.  We have brought two things together—the fun and bubbles of our carbonated beverages that people really love,  and the symbols and experiences of today is online world.  	 Our re-branding strategy sets an irresistible tone of joy,  optimism and energy.  Those are three words that I always want to be associated with PepsiCo.  	 PepsiCo International is balanced and diverse snack and beverage portfolio had a good year.  It delivered strong growth from treats to healthy eats.  This thriving business spans Europe,  the Middle EastAsia,  Africa and Australia,  serving 86 percent of the world is population.  With per-capita consumption 	 still relatively low in many of these markets,  we 	 have a strong opportunity to drive sales ahead of GDP growth.  	 This year we broadened our beverage portfolio by partnering with The Pepsi Bottling Group to acquire Russia is leading juice company,  Lebedyansky,  by acquiring V Water in the United Kingdom and by expanding our successful Lipton Tea partnership with Unilever.  In the snack business,  we acquired Bulgaria is leading nuts and seeds producer,  and we introduced a variety of local flavors,  including Lay is Shashlyk in Russia and Lay is Cool Blueberry in China.  In Indiawe introduced Kurkure Naughty Tomato and Lay is Balsamic Blast and Spunky Pimento flavors; and our Doritos brand helped drive volume in the Middle East and South Africa.  Together,  these initiatives helped PepsiCo International revenues grow by 19 percent and core operating profit by 16 percent. * 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
	 To sustain our worldwide growth,  we announced significant investments in key countries like BrazilIndia,  Mexico and China.  In India and Brazil,  we are combining capacity expansion and research and development (R&D) with sustainability efforts as we grow in those regions.  Building on a brand history of more than 100 years in Mexico,  we are investing over the next five years in R&D,  manufacturing and distribution,  marketing and advertising.  And in China—one of our fastest-growing markets—we are funding capacity expansion,  R&D,  increased distribution,  brand building,  agricultural sustainability and resource conservation.  	 All over the company,  we have Performance with Purpose as our mission.  And the way we achieve itall over the world,  is always to encourage new ways of working.  Innovation is our lifeblood—it drives success in all our businesses.  	 That is why we implemented a Productivity for Growth initiative across all sections of our business.  Over the next three years,  our productivity measures are expected to cumulatively free up more than $12 billion.  That money will allow us to step up investments in long-term product development,  innovation and brand building.  Our productivity savings will also enhance our operating agility and create some breathing room to respond to the changing economic environment.  And,  as long as that innovation is driven through the company,  we will deliver the demands of Performance with Purpose.  	 2008 was a year in which our mission could easily have been abandoned.  The extraordinary circumstances would have resulted in it being abandoned if it were not already embedded into our culture.  Soduring 2008 we stayed true to our beliefs,  even as the backdrop got tougher.  	 For example,  we never took our eyes off the sustainability agenda that underpins our commercial success.  We have now driven sustainability all the way through the business.  It is a part of what we donot an addition to what we do.  	 To promote human sustainability,  we worked within World Health Organization policies to teach

children the benefits of nutrition and inspire them to be more active.  This work complements and extends our success in transforming our broad portfolio of beverages,  snacks and foods,  to ensure it delivers everything from treats to healthy eats.  	 To sustain the environment for future generationswe stepped up our global efforts to conserve water and energy and worked on lightweighting our packages,  starting with new packaging for Aquafina that contains 35 percent less plastic.  	 To sustain our world-class talent,  we are developing 'PepsiCo University, " a new learning management system that brings together functional and leadership training for associates around the world.  	 Our Performance with Purpose mission is not confined to PepsiCo associates alone.  Even retired members of the PepsiCo family have joined our purpose movement,  banding together as the PepsiCo Service Corps to further our goals and ideals in the communities we serve.  	 Such a resolute performance and such a focus on our purpose is why I have such confidence in this company for the future.  Nobody can predict exactly how the global economic slowdown will affect specific markets in 2009,  or how consumers will respond to the pressures they face.  But we have shown we have the competitive strengths,  the right strategies and the tenacity to maintain our competitive edge.  	 We have to remember the deep brand value we have.  In good times and bad,  people view our products as simple,  affordable pleasures that keep them nourished and refreshed.  Worldwide,  our retail partners consider us a strategic partner whose powerful go-to-market systems deliver strong brands and fast-selling products that help them generate healthy cash flow.  	 We are led by an experienced management team that has proven it can address hyperinflationcurrency devaluation and political turmoil as it keeps us growing.  We are sustained by the associatescustomers and business partners who help us deliver fun,  nourishment and refreshment each day.  
	 And we are always facing the future,  looking for new ways of working,  new ways of making good on the promise of Performance with Purpose.  	 What you see in these pages is an account of the immediate past with some sense of how it brought us to the present.  But the essential point about our company,  the thing that makes us successful year in,  year out,  is that we are always thinking about the future.  	 To celebrate the future generation,  we asked the children of our associates around the world to draw their favorite PepsiCo products.  Some of these drawings are featured on this annual report is coverdemonstrating that we are growing in ways that nurture,  sustain and inspire people.  	 A great company is a place where people come together,  with a purpose in common.  By defining that purpose,  by trying to bottle it,  we are bound together.  That is the message you see on every page of this report.  It is full of stories and portraits that truly demonstrate the deeply personal,  emotional connection our associates have made to Performance with Purpose.  In any language,  our associates will tell you,  'We are Performance with Purpose. " Please join us on this trip around the globe,  and see for yourself why I'm so inspired by the great things we have accomplished together—and so excited about the many opportunities that still lie ahead.

We are taking sports drinks to more playing fields.  For years,  Gatorade Thirst Quencher has led the performance drink category by helping elite football,  baseball and basketball players keep their competitive edge.  These days,  a new sport and exercise culture is emerging.  Active people of all shapes and sizes are challenging themselves on their own terms to reach their own goals.  	 In 2008,  Gatorade changed the game we invented by redefining what it means to be an athlete.  We asked ourselves how a sports drink can become a catalyst for better minds and bodies,  and we launched Gatorade Tiger and G2,  a lowcalorie sports beverage.  But our innovation didn't stop there.  Building on our record of improving the nutritional profile of our products,  we have enhanced our newest product identities like 'Bring It" by adding B vitamins and 'Be Tough" by adding vitamin E.  Then we reenergized our entire Gatorade portfolio by combining new branding,  marketing and package design.  The new campaign encourages sports enthusiasts to tap into their G—the heart,  hustle and soul of the athlete.  Our newest product identities will help differentiate this mega-brand in today is marketplace and inspire sports enthusiasts to keep pushing beyond their comfort zone to achieve their full potential.

We brought the world the first naturally sweetened,  zerocalorie beverage.  For years,  we have searched for a natural sweetener that would help consumers cut back on calories without giving up on flavor.  The quest is over.  This year,  we introduced SoBe Lifewater with PureVia,  a new zero-calorie,  enhanced water beverage that doesn't compromise on taste.  	 Derived from the leaf of the stevia plant,  PureVia yields a clean,  consistent taste that purists love.

The SoBe team hit the mark with a new great-tasting,  zero-calorie naturally sweetened beverage.  
Our Frito-Lay marketing and research teams found their true north—and broadened our snack portfolio.  
We shook up the nut aisle.  As a world leader in snacks,  we wanted people to enjoy the health benefits of traditional nuts in new ways.  Our Frito-Lay marketing and research teams turned this passion for nuts into an innovative new snack with great taste and nutrition.  We started by asking,  'Why can't a nut be crunchier,  crispier and tastier,  without sacrificing any of its simple,  natural qualities?" And we combined great-tasting,  nutritious almonds,  peanutspistachios,  pecans or walnuts with unique shapes,  textures and tastes to create totally new snacking experiences,  all with 100 percent natural ingredients.  	 With TrueNorth,  we elevated the simple nut into surprising snacks—nut clusters and nut crisps.  Since the product launched in early 2008,  millions of health nuts have found their own allconsuming passion—their true north—in nut snacks that are delightfully crunchy,  crispy,  tasty and satisfying.  TrueNorth joins a family of nut and seed brands that gives PepsiCo a sizable share of a $24 billion packaged nut and seed category that is growing by 4 percent a year.

They want snacks that satisfy them on a variety of occasions— whether they are entertaining friends,  serving their families or enjoying a healthier indulgence.

Our 1100 associates in Cedar Rapids worked heroically to bring their flooded plant back on line.  
We were a beacon of hope in a time of adversity.  In June,  the river near our Quaker plant in Cedar Rapids,  Iowareached its highest point in a century,  and a devastating flood ravaged the community and temporarily closed our flagship plant.  Six days after evacuation,  we lit the iconic Quaker Oats sign atop our plant to provide a beacon of hope for our team and a light of optimism for our local community.  With the hard work and dedication of all 1100 employees at the plantwe began cleanup efforts and started limited production just a few weeks later.  The entire Quaker team worked tirelessly,  temporarily moving some production to other Quaker-owned facilities or contract manufacturing operations.  By the fall we were back to full production at home in Cedar Rapids.  	 Through this challenging year,  we did not take our eye off opportunities for new,  innovative products,  such as Quaker High Fiber Oatmeal.  Not only is it a great addition to our oatmeal line,  it also has the added benefit of fibersupplying 40 percent of the daily value to help Americans meet their dietary fiber requirements.  This new product is really catching on,  with consumers trying it and coming back for more.  PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report

Our team in Curitiba,  Brazil,  planted the seeds for greener growth.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
We turned crisis into opportunity.  On the last day of 2007,  a fire destroyed our major snack facility in Curitiba,  wiping out about 35 percent of our snack capacity in Brazil.  With no time to spare,  we assembled a team of experts from across our organization and challenged them to take care of our people,  restore our capacity and preserve market share.  	 Very quickly,  we increased production at our remaining Brazilian plants by running them around the clock.  We also stepped up production of our best-selling Elma Chips,  and focused promotions exclusively on our best innovation bet— our new baked Sensações ao Forno brand.  Within 45 days,  we secured capacity from another facility that could make up for some of the lost capacity.  A dedicated team from Curitiba then left their homes and families and traveled 396 km (246 miles) to get the newly acquired plant up and running.  	 Thanks to the can-do spirit and responsibility of our 9000 employees across Brazil,  our volume for the total region actually increased.  And today we are ready to grow even moreand to grow responsibly as we rebuild the Curitiba plant.  We planted a tree to symbolize the environmental sustainability attributes of the new plant.

We are driving less and selling more.  
Our Sabritas route sales representatives make fuel efficiency their calling card.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
When you reach for a PepsiCo product,  you probably don't think about everything we do to move snacks efficiently from the manufacturing plant to the point of sale.  At our Sabritas business in Mexico,  that is a priority.  We are working at every link of the supply chain to get more from our equipment,  reduce our delivery costs and save fuel.  We are bundling products at our plants to reduce handling.  And at our distribution center,  our new multi-bag handling process ensures that our large-capacity vans are always loaded with pre-filled racks containing a full variety of our snack products.     Our new system now spans seven production plants,  more than 180 distribution centers and over 6500 routes in Mexico.  And our route sales representatives are seeing the difference.  By reducing time per call and loading time at the distribution centerswe now have the time to visit four more customers daily on each route.  As a result,  we have seen sales per route increase by 29 percent and route efficiency improve by 34 percent.  Less driving also means lower fuel costs,  less energy consumption and a greener environment.  With this much successit is no wonder multi-bag handling is catching on across our entire company.  
We are sharing cultural insights to deliver authentic products.  
Our multicultural marketing team works with our ethnic advisory boards to extend our brands to a diverse range of consumers.  
 decade ago,  PepsiCo is multicultural marketing team tapped the expertise of our ethnic advisory boards to provide valuable external viewpoints that bring greater diversity to our products,  our supplier base and our workforce.  When the Latino/Hispanic Advisory Board in the United States visited Mexico for a board meeting,  they saw that the popular Sabritones snacks would hit home with the grow­ ing number of Latinos/Hispanics living north of the U.S.  border.  They shared their product,  market and cultural insights with the Sabritones team in Mexico.  Then they visited restaurants and small retail outlets in Latino/Hispanic communities to uncover the authentic flavors that would connect consumers to their homeland.  They also tasted newly developed flavors,  identified community influencers and guided the team toward greater authenticity in everything from advertising to packaging.  In the process,  they created a template for multicultural outreach that has become an industry best practice.  	This year we expanded the program by targeting the conven­ ience stores that anchor many Latino/Hispanic communities.  We worked with a large chain to introduce special point-of-purchase displays that position our products for Latino/Hispanic consum­ ers.  In 2008,  the program reached more than 50 percent of the chain is regional stores,  driving sales of Sabritones up 11 percent.  These strong results reflect the product is popularity with Latinos/ Hispanics—and also with a diverse range of people whose tastes extend across different cultures.  And early in 2009,  we are launch­ ing a whole new line of Sabritas chips in the United States,  with authentic flavors that include Chile Piquín and Habanero Limón.

We welcomed the Lebedyansky family of juices and nectars to our expanding beverage portfolio.  
We found a natural fit in Russia.  As Russia is middle class expands,  more families are discovering the good taste and health benefits of natural juices and nectars.

Last yearPepsiCo and The Pepsi Bottling Group turned this market trend into opportunity when we welcomed Lebedyansky,  Russia is leading producer of branded juices,  to our fast-growing international system.  With Lebedyansky,  6000 dedicated associates joined the PepsiCo family,  bringing their commitment to innovation,  sustainability and a results-driven entrepreneurial culture that is a natural fit with the PepsiCo system.  	 While Russians have enjoyed Pepsi-Cola for nearly 35 years,  Lebedyansky transformed our beverage system by adding its market leadership in natural juices and nectars to our full lineup of carbonated and noncarbonated mega-brands.  Together with The Pepsi Bottling Group,  we increased our market position in juices from sixth to first in Russia,  and from fourth to first in Europe.

Associates in the Pepsi Lipton International partnership are taking worldwide distribution to new heights.  
We joined forces to attract more customers.  Ready-to-drink tea is a fast-growing beverage category,  and our partnership with Unilever combines the best-selling Lipton tea brand with PepsiCo is strength in product developmentbottling,  distribution and marketing.  Last year we expanded our relationship by adding 11 countries—including eight in Europe—to the Pepsi Lipton International network.    	 When the team joined together in France,  we welcomed 30 new associates from Unilever.  Even with our market-leading position in ready-to-drink teas in France,  we asked ourselves how we could jump-start the category is growth.  We applied our marketing know-how to reposition the brand,  by reminding people of the refreshment,  great taste and natural ingredients that make Lipton a great on-the-go beverage.  During our initial year,  23 million cases of our Lipton ready-to-drink tea passed through the PepsiCo France system.  Working together,  we grew volume and returned Lipton readyto-drink tea to a growth business in France.  We also improved customer service and consolidated our warehouse system to reduce costs.  	 While we were extending the partnership in Europe and beyond,  we have been innovating in the United States to bring new beverage offerings to consumers.  This year we'll introduce a new Lipton Sparkling Green Tea that brings together the goodness of green tea and the 	 joy of bubbles; and we'll launch a Lipton tea product 	 that helps improve focus and concentration.

We are connecting to consumers in new ways.  
The Walkers ad campaign used digital communications to connect the British landscape with today is online landscape.  
How do you capture the attention of four generations of consumers—each with its own ideas about thirst,  hydration and taste,  and even communication? In the United KingdomWalkers' marketing team launched a promotion that raised the bar for in-store and online marketing.   	 Our highly engaging Brit Trips campaign used a full 360-degree approach—with on-pack and in-store customer overlays,  TV,  radio and online advertising,  and media partnerships—to attract more than four million visits to the Brit Trips website.  As many as 600000 consumers registered,  earned points by buying Walkers crisps and redeemed them against offers for 10000 trips—from hotels and historic houses to theme parks and restaurant lunches.  The campaign helped Walkers deliver measurable gains in revenue,  volume and share.  And we deepened our relationship with consumers.  More than 60 percent of participants opted to keep in touch with Walkers news through a digital newsletter.

Several PepsiCo plants worldwide are using a mix of biofuels to make beverages and snacks from cleaner energy sources.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
To increase our reliance on renewable energy sources,  we built a wind turbine in India and are using solar power at several U.S.  facilities.  
We are making clean,  renewable energy our future.  At PepsiCo,  performance meets purpose through sustainable practices that are good for business—and good for the environment.  We are investing in the future through programs that help us reduce energy costs,  conserve more energy and use clean energy sources.  	 Our India business built PepsiCo is first remote wind turbine and connected it to the region is electricity grid to make our operations more sustainable—and reduce our environmental footprint.  Today,  our wind turbine supplies more than twothirds of the power our Mamandur beverage plant uses.  It also has the potential to offset up to 5 percent of the electricity PepsiCo India uses in its company-owned bottling operations.  And importantly,  last year it reduced annual carbon emissions by an estimated 3000 tons.  It has the potential to save more than $200000 per year.  	 With our wind energy program,  and investments in solar lighting and biomass boilers,  more than 16 percent of the energy PepsiCo India used in company-owned plants during 2008 was derived from renewable sources.  PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Water conservation is giving communities worldwide greater access to clean,  safe drinking water.  
We are conserving today for a better tomorrow.  In 2003,  we asked ourselves how our beverage manufacturing plants in India could achieve our goal of conserving more water than we use.  By measuring and mapping water flows,  we found new opportunities to recycle.  We also began harvesting rainwater in most plants and worked with local farmers to develop far-reaching watershed management programs.  Five years later,  we are using 55 percent less water in India,  making a difference in a country where water is a scarce resource.  	 The PepsiCo Foundation continues to develop sustainable partnerships and programs in the most underserved areas of the world to allow for access to secure,  safe water.  The Foundation has invested approximately $15 million in multiyear commitments to support key partners and programs focused on eliminating the water crisis.  This work not only will provide safe water for people today,  but also create sustainable and scalable models that will accelerate access to safe water and sanitation for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world.

Our R&D team in Shanghai infuses our mega-brands with local flavors.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
We help create the flavors you can't resist.  In markets around the world,  our research and development teams support our growth by turning our global brands into local favorites.  We work closely with local master chefs who understand the preferred tastes and consumption patterns of people in specific regions and cultures.  These insights then inspire us to extend our existing brands and invent new categories and flavors.  	   Here is how it works.  In Asia,  we learned that people strongly prefer beverages that contain natural ingredients.  We responded by introducing Pepsi Raw with pure sugar cane.  We also experimented with local flavor combinations to create Tropicana GuoBinFen,  a new category of exotic mixed juices.  This breakthrough non-carbonated beverage,  available in Honey Melon & Jasmine and Orange & Honeysucklebecame PepsiCo International is largest and most successful new product this year and helped us grow our market share in China is major cities.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Our China agriculture team teaches valuable lessons in water-efficient growth.  
We are growing more crop per drop.  We depend on a reliable flow of high-quality raw materials to keep products moving from the seed to the shelf.  With fluctuating prices,  weather conditions and other variables at playwe leverage our global scale and purchasing power to make smart buying and operating decisions.  By developing regional procurement strategies,  we can protect our supply chain and margins and support the growth of local economies.  	 In the United States and many other regions,  we contract with local growers to secure high-quality raw materials such as potatoes for our popular chip brands.  But in China,  we rent large land parcels and grow our own crops from the ground up.  Our China strategy ensures quality and makes us less vulnerable to fluctuating commodities prices.  It also opens many avenues to improve quality of life in local communities.  Across the worldagriculture is responsible for more than 70 percent of water consumed,  and this can be as high as 90 percent in developing economies like India and China.  We are introducing pivot and drip irrigation systems that reduce agricultural water consumption by up to 50 percent.  And our agronomists are teaching more than 5000 local farmers and university students the benefits of sustainable agriculture and advanced techniques they can use to manage our crops and build their own careers.

This includes meeting consumer needs for a spectrum of convenient foods and beverages,  reducing our impact on the environment through water,  energy and packaging initiatives,  and supporting our employees through a diverse and inclusive culture that recruits and retains world-class talent.  In September 2008we were again included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.  These indices are compiled annually.  We were again included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.  
Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial conditions.  These indicators include market share,  volume,  net revenue,  operating profit,  management operating cash flow,  earnings per share and return on invested capital.  Key Challenges and Strategies for Growth To achieve our financial objectives,  we consistently focus on initiatives to improve our results and increase returns for our shareholders.  For 2009,  we have identified the following key challenges and related competitive strategies for growth that we believe will enable us to achieve our financial objectives: 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Revitalizing our North American Beverage Business In 2008,  the U.S.  liquid refreshment beverage category declined on a year-over-year basis.  During 2009,  we intend to invest to keep our total beverage portfolio relevant to consumers of all ages.  We plan to capitalize on our new 'Refresh Everything" campaign,  which features new brand identities for trademarks Gatorade,  Pepsi,  Sierra Mist and Mountain Dew,  as well as key product innovations like new SoBe Lifewater,  sweetened with PureVia™,  an all-natural,  zero-calorie sweetener recently approved by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration.  In non-carbonated beverages,  we will work to identify untapped thirst occasions and to deliver even more functional benefits.  Broadening our Diverse Portfolio of Global Products Consumer tastes and preferences are constantly changing.  The increasingly on-the-go lifestyles of consumers and their desire for healthier choices means that it is more important than ever for us to continue to broaden our diverse portfolio of global products.  We remain committed to offering consumers a broad range of choices to satisfy their diverse lifestyles and desires.  For examplein 2008,  we broadened the beverage portfolio by partnering with The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) to acquire JSC Lebedyansky (Lebedyansky),  Russia is leading juice company,  by acquiring V Water in the United Kingdom and by expanding our successful Lipton Tea partnership with Unilever.  We expanded into adjacent snack categories by introducing TrueNorth nut snacks and forming a joint venture that offers Sabra refrigerated dips.  During 2009through a combination of tuck-in acquisitions and innovationwe plan to continue to broaden the range of products we offer in our existing categories and expand into adjacent ones.  We are also committed to securing our innovation pipeline,  and have coordinated our research and development departments across the Company into one global innovation team.  Successfully Navigating the Global Economic Crisis We and our customers,  suppliers and distributors have all been impacted by the continuing global economic crisis.  Global economic conditions have resulted in decreased consumer purchasing power,  volatile fluctuations in the prices of key commodities such as oil,  corn,  sugar and oats and adverse foreign currency exchange rates.  To navigate through these conditions we plan to continue to focus on fundamentals,  such as ensuring that we offer products with the right price to value proposition and managing cash flow,  interest expense and commodity costs.  We have also implemented our Productivity for Growth program which is 
expected to cumulatively generate more than $12 billion in pretax savings over the next three years and that will also allow us to increase investments in long-term research and developmentinnovation,  brand building and market-specific growth initiatives.  We have also implemented our Productivity for Growth program which is expected to cumulatively generate more than $12 billion in pre-tax savings over the next three years.  
Expanding in International Markets Our operations outside of the United States contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability.  Because per capita consumption of our products is still relatively low in many of these markets,  we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow internationally by expanding our existing businesses and through acquisitions,  particularly in emerging markets.  During 2008,  we announced significant capital investments in Brazil,  India,  Mexico and China.  We also strengthened our international presence through acquisitions such as Marbo,  a snacks company in Serbiaby expanding our successful Lipton Tea partnership with Unileverand by partnering with PBG to acquire Russia is largest juice company.  We plan to seek opportunities to make similar investments to drive international growth in 2009 and beyond.  We also plan to continue developing products that leverage our existing brands but appeal to local tastes.  Maintaining our Commitment to Sustainable Growth Consumers and government officials are increasingly focused on the impact companies have on the environment.  We are committed to maintaining high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity and to reducing our impact on the environment through water,  energy and packaging initiatives.  We plan to continue to invest in programs that help us reduce energy costs,  conserve more energy and use clean energy sources,  such as our wind turbine project in India which supplies more than two-thirds of the power used by our Mamandur beverage plant each year.  We are also actively working on new packaging initiatives to further reduce the amount of plastic used in our beverage containersand we continue to partner with community organizations to increase recycling efforts.  We are committed to maintaining high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity and to reducing our impact on the environment through water,  energy and packaging initiatives.  
Our Operations We are organized into three business units,  as follows: (1)	PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF),  which includes Frito-Lay North America (FLNA),  Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) and all of our Latin American food and snack businesses (LAF),  including our Sabritas and Gamesa businesses in Mexico; (2)	PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB),  which includes PepsiCo Beverages North America and all of our Latin American beverage businesses; and (3)	PepsiCo International (PI),  which includes all PepsiCo businesses in the United Kingdom,  Europe,  Asia,  Middle East and Africa.  Our three business units are comprised of six reportable segments (referred to as divisions),  as follows: 	 FLNA	 QFNA	 LAF	 PAB	 United Kingdom & Europe (UKEU),  and 	 Middle East,  Africa & Asia (MEAA).  Frito-Lay North America FLNA manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  marketssells and distributes branded snacks.

PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Latin America Foods LAF manufactures,  markets and sells a number of leading salty and sweet snack brands including Gamesa,  Doritos,  CheetosRuffles,  Sabritas and Lay is.  Further,  LAF manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells many Quaker brand cereals and snacks.  These branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers.  PepsiCo Americas Beverages PAB manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells beverage concentrates,  fountain syrups and finished goodsunder various beverage brands including Pepsi,  Mountain DewGatorade,  7UP (outside the U.S. ),  Tropicana Pure Premium,  Sierra Mist,  Mirinda,  Tropicana juice drinks,  Propel,  Dole,  Amp EnergySoBe Lifewater,  Naked juice and Izze.  PAB also manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells ready-to-drink teacoffee and water products through joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks.  In addition,  PAB licenses the Aquafina water brand to its bottlers and markets this brand.  PAB sells concentrate and finished goods for some of these brands to authorized bottlers,  and some of these branded finished goods are sold directly by us to independent distributors and retailers.  The bottlers sell our brands as finished goods to independent distributors and retailers.  PAB is volume reflects sales to its independent distributors and retailers,  as well as the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that bottlers have reported as sold to independent distributors and retailers.  Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonalitytiming of product launches,  product mix,  bottler inventory practices and other factors.  While our revenues are not based on BCS volume,  we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our products at the consumer level.  United Kingdom & Europe UKEU manufactures,  markets and sells through consolidated businesses as well as through noncontrolled affiliates,  a number of leading salty and sweet snack brands including Lay is,  WalkersDoritos,  Cheetos and Ruffles.  Further,  UKEU manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells many Quaker brand cereals and snacks.  UKEU also manufactures,  markets and sells beverage concentrates,  fountain syrups and finished goodsunder various beverage brands including Pepsi,  7UP and Tropicana.  In addition,  through our acquisition of Lebedyansky,  we acquired Russia is leading juice brands.  These brands are sold to authorized 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
bottlers,  independent distributors and retailers.  However,  in certain markets,  UKEU operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities.  In addition,  UKEU licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its authorized bottlers.  UKEU also manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name).  UKEU reports two measures of volume.  Snack volume is reported on a system-wide basis,  which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks.  Beverage volume reflects Company-owned or authorized bottler sales of beverages bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks to independent distributors and retailers (see PepsiCo Americas Beverages above).  Middle East,  Africa & Asia MEAA manufactures,  markets and sells through consolidated businesses as well as through noncontrolled affiliates,  a number of leading salty and sweet snack brands including Lay is,  DoritosCheetos,  Smith is and Ruffles.  Further,  MEAA manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells many Quaker brand cereals and snacks.  MEAA also manufactures,  markets and sells beverage concentrates,  fountain syrups and finished goodsunder various beverage brands including Pepsi,  Mirinda,  7UP and Mountain Dew.  These brands are sold to authorized bottlers,  independent distributors and retailers.  However,  in certain marketsMEAA operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities.  In addition,  MEAA licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its authorized bottlers.  MEAA also manufactures or uses contract manufacturers,  markets and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever.  MEAA reports two measures of volume (see United Kingdom & Europe above).  New Organizational Structure Beginning in the first quarter of 2009,  we realigned certain countries within PI to be consistent with changes in geographic responsibility.  As a result,  our businesses in Turkey and certain Central Asia markets will become part of UKEU,  which was renamed the Europe division.  These countries were formerly part of MEAA,  which was renamed the Asia,  Middle East & Africa division.  The changes did not impact the other existing reportable segments.  Our historical segment reporting will be restated in 2009 to reflect the new structure.  The division amounts and discussions reflected in this Annual Report reflect the management reporting that existed through 2008.  
Our Customers Our customers include authorized bottlers and independent distributors,  including foodservice distributors and retailers.  We normally grant our bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area.  These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our bottlers for concentrate,  finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality.  Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  For our independent distributors and retailers,  these incentives include volume-based rebates,  product placement fees,  promotions and displays.  For our bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentivesadvertising support,  new product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include coupons,  pricing discounts and promotions,  and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting bottler media.  New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-of-purchase materials,  product placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  In 2008sales to Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  (Wal-Mart),  including Sam is Club (Sam is),  represented approximately 12% of our total net revenue.  Our top five retail customers represented approximately 32% of our 2008 North American net revenue,  with Wal-Mart (including Sam is) representing approximately 18%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  In addition,  sales to PBG represented approximately 8% of our total net revenue in 2008.  See 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 for more information on our anchor bottlers.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  
Our Related Party Bottlers We have ownership interests in certain of our bottlers.  Our ownership is less than 50%,  and since we do not control these bottlers,  we do not consolidate their results.  We have designated three related party bottlers,  PBG,  PepsiAmericas,  Inc.  (PAS) and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC (PBV),  as our anchor bottlers.  We include our share of their net income based on our percentage of economic ownership in our income statement as bottling equity income.  Our anchor bottlers distribute approximately 60% of our North American beverage volume and approximately 17% of our beverage volume outside of North America.  Our anchor bottlers participate in the bottler funding programs described above.  Approximately 6% of our total 2008 sales incentives were related to these bottlers.  See Note 8 for additional information on these related parties and related party commitments and guarantees.  Our share of net income from other noncontrolled affiliates is recorded as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD),  customer warehouse and foodservice and vending distribution networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needs,  product characteristics and local trade practices.  Direct-Store-Delivery We,  our bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.  DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,  have lower turnover,  and are less likely to be impulse purchases.  Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks,  foods and beverages to third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  Our foodservice and vending sales force also distributes certain beverages through our bottlers.  This distribution system supplies our products to schools,  businesses,  stadiumsrestaurants and similar locations.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  We compete against global,  regional,  local and private label manufacturers on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  In U.S.  measured channels,  our chief beverage competitor,  The Coca-Cola Company,  has a larger share of carbonated soft drinks (CSD) consumption,  while we have a larger share of liquid refreshment beverages consumption.  In addition,  The Coca-Cola Company has a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside the United States.  Further,  our snack brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack industry worldwide.  Our snack brands face local and regional competitors,  as well as national and global snack competitors,  and compete on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products and the introduction of new products.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketingcoupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network,  allow us to compete effectively.  Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations.  Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our employees serve on the boards of our anchor bottlers and other affiliated companies and do not receive incremental compensation for their Board services.  Our Business Risks Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.  We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits,  we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position.  Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends,  including concerns of consumers regarding obesity,  product attributes and ingredients.  In addition,  changes 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors,  including the aging of the general population,  changes in social trends,  changes in travel,  vacation or leisure activity patterns,  weather,  negative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in our industry,  a downturn in economic conditions or taxes specifically targeting the consumption of our products.  Any of these changes may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase our products.  See also the discussions under 'The global economic crisis has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " and 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costsreduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovation,  including maintaining a robust pipeline of new productsand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal,  there can be no assurance as to our continued ability either to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products,  or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  Our failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands,  as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovationincluding maintaining a robust pipeline of new products,  and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  
Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs,  disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  We and our business partners use various raw materials and other supplies in our business,  including aspartame,  cocoa,  corncorn sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruits and other fruitsjuice and juice concentrates,  oats,  oranges,  potatoes,  rice,  seasonings,  sucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils,  and wheat.  Our key packaging materials include polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin used for plastic bottles,  film packaging used for snack 
foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles and cardboard.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities due to their use in our plants and in the trucks delivering our products.  Some of these raw materials and supplies are available from a limited number of suppliers.  We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy.  The raw materials and energy which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demandweather conditions,  agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costs,  we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating income.  See also the discussion under 'The global economic crisis has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " The global economic crisis has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions and increased volatility in foreign exchange rates and may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  The global economic crisis has resulted in unfavorable economic conditions in many of the countries in which we operate.  Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these unfavorable economic conditions,  including: adverse changes in interest rates or tax rates; volatile commodity markets; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace potentially impairing our ability to access the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all; the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions; reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down in the general global economy or a shift in consumer preferences to private label products for economic reasons; or a further decrease in the fair value of pension assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension plans.  The global economic crisis has also resulted in increased foreign exchange rate volatility.  We hold assets and incur liabilities,  earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars.  As a result,  our profitability may be adversely impacted by an adverse change in foreign currency 
exchange rates.  In addition,  we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our critical customerssuppliers and distributors and any negative impact on our critical customers,  suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  successfully implement our ongoing business transformation initiative or outsource certain functions effectively our business could suffer.  We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers,  as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficienciesthe loss of customers,  business disruptions,  or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We have embarked on a multi-year business transformation initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application,  as well as the migration to common business processes across our operations.  There can be no certainty that these programs will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the application on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue.  In addition,  we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions,  such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration,  to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform effectivelywe may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers.  Depending on the function involved,  such errors may also lead to business disruption,  processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach,  or harm employee morale.  Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information,  corrupting information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  If we fail to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  our reputation could be jeopardized.  Adverse publicity about these types of concerns or the incidence of product contamination or tampering,  whether or not valid,  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption,  misbranded or causes injury,  we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of timewhich could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to health concerns,  our environmental impacts,  including agricultural materials,  packaging,  energy use and waste management,  or other sustainability issues,  could jeopardize our reputation.  In addition,  water is a limited resource in many parts of the world.  Our reputation could be damaged if we do not act responsibly with respect to water use.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  Trade consolidation,  the loss of any key customer,  or failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners could adversely affect our financial performance.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  including our retailers and bottling partnersto effectively compete.  There is a greater concentration of our customer base around the world generally due to the continued consolidation of retail trade.  As retail ownership becomes more concentrated,  retailers demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  as larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to these trends or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  Loss of any of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore,  if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottlers through a combination of advertising and marketing support,  they may take actions that,  while maximizing their own short-term profit,  may be detrimental to us or our brands.  Such actions could have an adverse effect on our profitability.  In addition,  any deterioration of our relationships with our bottlers could adversely affect our business or financial performance.  See 'Our Customers, " 'Our Related Party Bottlers" and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers,  including our anchor bottlers.  If we are unable to hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce,  it could have a negative impact on our business.  Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  We compete to hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  In addition,  our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees,  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  
Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  The conduct of our businesses,  and the production,  distributionsale,  advertising,  labeling,  safety,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies 
in the United States,  as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate.  These laws and regulations may changesometimes dramatically,  as a result of political,  economic or social events.  Such regulatory environment changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to advertising and deceptive marketing practices; accounting standards; taxation requirementsincluding taxes specifically targeting the consumption of our products; competition laws; and environmental laws,  including laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment.  Changes in laws,  regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business andtherefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  In particular,  governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where we operate may impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  For example,  studies are underway by various regulatory authorities and others to assess the effect on humans due to acrylamide in the diet.  Acrylamide is a chemical compound naturally formed in a wide variety of foods when they are cooked (whether commercially or at home),  including french friespotato chips,  cereal,  bread and coffee.  It is believed that acrylamide may cause cancer in laboratory animals when consumed in significant amounts.  If consumer concerns about acrylamide increase as a result of these studies,  other new scientific evidence,  or for any other reason,  whether or not valid,  demand for our products could decline and we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products,  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are also subject to Proposition 65 in California,  a law which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance listed by that State as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold,  sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may also have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctionswhich could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  See also 'Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance. " 
Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability and that of our suppliers,  business partners,  including bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  independent distributors and retailers,  to make,  move and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to adverse weather conditions,  natural disasterfire,  terrorism,  the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilitiespandemic,  strikes and other labor disputes or other reasons beyond our or their control,  could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occur,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the countries where we operate may adversely impact our business.  Our operations outside of the United States contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability.  Unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the countries where we operate could have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Factors that could adversely affect our business results in these countries include: import and export restrictions; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets; regulations on the repatriation of funds; and currency hyperinflation or devaluation.  In addition,  disruption in these markets due to political instability or civil unrest could result in a decline in consumer purchasing power,  thereby reducing demand for our products.  Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives will necessarily involve taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritize,  manage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes: 	 The PepsiCo Executive Committee (PEC),  comprised of a cross-functional,  geographically diverse,  senior management group which meets regularly to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address strategic and reputational risks; 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 	 Division Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet regularly each year to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address division-specific operating risks; 	 PepsiCo is Risk Management Office,  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PEC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties,  as well as to PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors; 	 PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and 	 PepsiCo is Compliance Office,  which leads and coordinates 	 our compliance policies and practices.  Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 	 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials 	 and energy	 foreign exchange rates,  and 	 interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  
In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiativesglobal purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing 	 productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price 	 purchase orders and pricing agreements.  See Note 9 for further information on our noncancelable purchasing commitments.  	 Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  	 We perform a quarterly assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  including a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  We consider 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
this risk to be low,  because we limit our exposure to individualstrong creditworthy counterparties and generally settle on a 	 net basis.  The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to stock prices and discount rates.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing 	 of our products.  Commodity Prices We expect to be able to reduce the impact of volatility in our 	 raw material and energy costs through our hedging strategies 	 and ongoing sourcing initiatives.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $303 million at December 27,  2008 and $5 million at December 29,  2007.  These contracts resulted in net unrealized losses of $117 million at December 27,  2008 and net unrealized gains of less than $1 million at December 29,  2007.  At the end of 2008,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2008 by $19 million.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $626 million at December 27,  2008 and $105 million at December 29,  2007.  These contracts resulted in net losses of $343 million in 2008 	 and net gains of $3 million in 2007.  At the end of 2008,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instrumentsassuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity pricewould have increased our net losses in 2008 by $34 million.  Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into 	 U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and 	 liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  
Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 48% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising 19% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  During 2008,  net favorable foreign currencyprimarily due to appreciation in the euro and Chinese yuanpartially offset by depreciation in the British pound,  contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  Currency declines against the U.S.  dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  We may enter into derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $14 billion at December 27,  2008 and $16 billion at December 29,  2007.  The contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $111 million at December 27,  2008 and net unrealized losses of $44 million at December 29,  2007.  At the end of 2008,  we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains by $70 million.  The contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net loss of $28 million in 2008 and a net gain of $15 million in 2007.  All losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Our 2008 and 2007 interest rate swaps were entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they modified.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Assuming year-end 2008 variable rate debt and investment levels,  a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $21 million in 2008.  
Our Critical Accounting Policies An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results.  These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve the choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: 	revenue recognition	brand and goodwill valuations	income tax expense and accruals,  and 	pension and retiree medical plans.  
Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationallyand may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  Our bottlers have a similar replacement policy and are responsible for the products they distribute.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In addition,  DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  we monitor customer inventory levels.  As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $125 billion in 2008,  $113 billion in 2007 and $101 billion in 2006.  Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalfsuch as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targets,  and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  For interim reporting,  we estimate total annual sales incentives for most of our programs and record a pro rata share in proportion to revenue.  Certain arrangementssuch as fountain pouring rights,  may extend beyond one year.  The costs incurred to obtain these incentive arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $333 million at year-end 2008 and $314 million at year-end 2007 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,  the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Brand and Goodwill Valuations We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands in acquisitions.  Upon acquisition,  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities,  including brands,  based on estimated fair value,  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill.  Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  such as marketplace participants,  product life cycles,  market shareconsumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance,  and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful liveswhich generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Perpetual brands and goodwill,  including the goodwill that is part of our noncontrolled bottling investment balances,  are not amortized.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  
Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair valuewhich is based on its discounted future cash flows.  Management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluationssuch as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  
We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual brands or goodwill in the years presented.  As of December 272008,  we had $63 billion of perpetual brands and goodwill,  of which approximately 55% related to Tropicana and Walkers.  Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such 
as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  In 2008,  our annual tax rate was 268% compared to 259% in 2007 as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2008 increased 09 percentage points primarily due to the absence of the tax benefits recognized in the prior year related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters,  partially offset by lower taxes on foreign results in the current year.  In 2009,  our annual tax rate is expected to be approximately the same as 2008.  Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost.  Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of the benefits that employees earn while working,  as well as the present value of those benefits.  Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost),  (2) increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost),  and (3) other gains and losses as discussed below,  reduced by (4) expected return on plan assets for our funded plans.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense include: 	 the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 	 certain employee-related factors,  such as turnover,  retirement age and mortality; 	 for pension expense,  the expected return on assets in our funded plans and the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and 	 for retiree medical expense,  health care cost trend rates.  Our assumptions reflect our experience and management is best judgment regarding future expectations.  Due to the significant management judgment involved,  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expenses and obligations.  At each measurement date,  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high-quality,  long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities.  Prior to 2008,  we used the Moody is Aa Corporate Bond Index yield (Moody is Aa Index) in the U.S.  and adjusted for differences between the average duration of the bonds in this Index and the average duration of our benefit liabilities,  based upon a published index.  As of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year,  our U.S.  discount rate is determined using the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (Mercer Yield Curve).  The Mercer Yield Curve uses a portfolio of high-quality bonds rated Aa or higher by Moody is.  We believe the Mercer Yield Curve includes bonds that provide a better match to the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments than the Moody is Aa Index.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively-managed securities and is reviewed annually based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  We employ certain equity strategies which,  in addition to investments in U.S.  and international common and preferred stock,  include investments in certain equity- and debt-based securities used collectively to generate returns in excess of certain equity-based indices.  Debt-based securities represent approximately 3% and 30% of our equity strategy portfolio as of year-end 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 89% from our equity strategies,  and 63% from our fixed income strategies.  Our target investment allocation is 60% for equity strategies and 40% for fixed income strategies.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  we use a market-related valuation method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) for securities included in our equity strategies over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-toyear volatility.  For all other asset categories,  the actual fair value is used for the market-related value of assets.  The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets is added to,  or subtracted from,  other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 12 years for retiree medical expense.  
Effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year,  we amended our U.S.  hourly pension plan to increase the amount of participant earnings recognized in determining pension benefits.  Additional pension plan amendments were also made as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year to comply with legislative and regulatory changes.  The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan is liability and expense is reviewed annually.  Our review is based on our claim experience,  information provided by our health plans and actuaries,  and our knowledge of the health care industry.  Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics,  plan design,  new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.  Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: Pension Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Expected rate of salary increases Retiree medical Expense discount rate Current health care cost trend rate 
Based on our assumptions,  we expect our pension expense to decrease in 2009,  as expected asset returns on 2009 contributions and costs associated with our Productivity for Growth program recognized in 2008 are partially offset by an increase in experience loss amortization.  The increase in experience loss amortization is due primarily to pension plan asset losses in 2008 and a slight decline in discount rates.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  The estimated impact of a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on 2009 pension expense is an increase of approximately $31 million.  The estimated impact on 2009 pension expense of a 25-basis-point decrease in the expected rate of return is an increase of approximately $18 million.  See Note 7 regarding the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  
Future Funding We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions,  and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible.  Our pension contributions for 2008 were $149 million,  of which $23 million was discretionary.  In 2009,  we will make contributions of $11 billion with up to $1 billion being discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical benefits are estimated to be approximately $100 million in 2009.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors,  such as changes in interest rates,  deviations between actual and expected asset returns,  and changes in tax or other benefit laws.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7.  In 2009,  we will make pension contributions of $11 billion with up to $1 billion being discretionary.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 159,  The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No.  115 (SFAS 159),  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  We adopted SFAS 159 as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year and our adoption did not impact our financial statements.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007)Business Combinations (SFAS 141R),  to improve,  simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations.  SFAS 141R continues the movement toward the greater use of fair value in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures.  It changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both

Management is Discussion and Analysis on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods.  The provisions of SFAS 141R are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year,  with the exception of adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.  Future adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year would apply the provisions of SFAS 141R and will be evaluated based on the outcome of these matters.  We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS 160,  Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,  an Amendment of ARB 51 (SFAS 160).  SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) 51 to establish new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries.  The provisions of SFAS 160 are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year on a prospective basis.  We do not expect our adoption of SFAS 160 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  In the first quarter of 2009,  we will include the required disclosures for all periods presented.  In March 2008,  the FASB issued SFAS 161,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161)which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133),  to provide an enhanced understanding of the use of derivative instruments,  how they are accounted for under SFAS 133 and their effect on financial position,  financial performance and cash flows.  The disclosure provisions of SFAS 161 are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year.  
Our Financial Results Items Affecting Comparability The year-over-year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items: Operating profit Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Net income Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Tax benefits PepsiCo share of PBG restructuring and impairment charges PepsiCo share of PBG tax settlement Net income per common share diluted Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Tax benefits PepsiCo share of PBG restructuring and impairment charges PepsiCo share of PBG tax settlement 
Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include energy,  fruit and other raw materials.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  In 2008,  we recognized $346 million ($223 million after-tax or $014 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2007,  we recognized $19 million ($12 million after-tax or $001 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2006,  we recognized $18 million ($12 million after-tax or $001 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2008,  we incurred a charge of $543 million ($408 million after-tax or $025 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program.  The program includes actions in all divisions of the business,  including the closure of six plants that we believe 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
will increase cost competitiveness across the supply chainupgrade and streamline our product portfolio,  and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.  In connection with this program,  we expect to incur an additional pre-tax charge of approximately $30 million to $60 million in 2009.  In 2007,  we incurred a charge of $102 million ($70 million after-tax or $004 per share) in conjunction with restructuring actions primarily to close certain plants and rationalize other production lines.  In 2006,  we incurred a charge of $67 million ($43 million after-tax or $003 per share) in conjunction with consolidating the manufacturing network at FLNA by closing two plants in the U.S.,  and rationalizing other assets,  to increase manufacturing productivity and supply chain efficiencies.  Tax Benefits In 2007,  we recognized $129 million ($008 per share) of noncash tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters.  In 2006,  we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $602 million ($036 per share),  substantially all of which related to the Internal Revenue Service is (IRS) examination of our consolidated tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  PepsiCo Share of PBG is Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2008,  PBG implemented a restructuring initiative across all of its geographic segments.  In addition,  PBG recognized an asset impairment charge related to its business in Mexico.  Consequently,  a non-cash charge of $138 million was included in bottling equity income ($114 million after-tax or $007 per share) as part of recording our share of PBG is financial results.  PepsiCo Share of PBG Tax Settlement In 2006,  the IRS concluded its examination of PBG is consolidated income tax returns for the years 1999 through 2000.  Consequentlya non-cash benefit of $21 million was included in bottling equity income ($18 million after-tax or $001 per share) as part of recording our share of PBG is financial results.  Results of Operations − Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit beloweffective net pricing reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions,  sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different 
countries.  Additionally,  acquisitions reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity,  including the impact of acquisitions,  divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries.  The impact of acquisitions related to our non-consolidated equity investees is reflected in our volume and,  excluding our anchor bottlers,  in our operating profit.  Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e.,  kilos,  gallons,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  In 2008,  total servings increased 3% compared to 2007,  as servings for both beverages and snacks worldwide grew 3%.  In 2007,  total servings increased over 4% compared to 2006,  as servings for beverages worldwide grew 4% and servings for snacks worldwide grew 6%.  Net Revenue and Operating Profit Change 2008

PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis Other corporate unallocated expenses decreased 14%.  The favorable impact of certain employee-related items,  including lower deferred compensation and pension costs were partially offset by higher costs associated with our global SAP implementation and increased research and development costs.  The decrease in deferred compensation costs are offset by a decrease in interest income from losses on investments used to economically hedge these costs.  2007 Total operating profit increased 10% and margin decreased 03 percentage points.  The operating profit growth reflects leverage from the revenue growth,  offset by increased cost of sales,  largely due to higher raw material costs.  The impact of foreign currency contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.  There was no net impact of acquisitions on operating profit growth.  Other corporate unallocated expenses increased 7%,  primarily reflecting increased research and development costs and the absence of certain other favorable corporate items in 2006partially offset by lower pension costs.

Bottling equity income Interest expense,  net Annual tax rate Net income Net income per common share diluted 
Bottling equity income includes our share of the net income or loss of our anchor bottlers as described in 'Our Customers. " Our interest in these bottling investments may change from time to time.  Any gains or losses from these changes,  as well as other transactions related to our bottling investments,  are also included on a pre-tax basis.  In November 2007,  our Board of Directors approved the sale of additional PBG stock to an economic ownership level of 35%,  as well as the sale of PAS stock to the ownership level at the time of the merger with Whitman Corporation in 2000 of about 37%.  We sold 88 million and 95 million shares of PBG stock in 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  In addition,  in 2008we sold 33 million shares of PAS stock.  The resulting lower ownership percentages reduce the equity income from PBG and PAS that we recognize.  See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources – Investing Activities" for further information with respect to planned sales of PBG and PAS stock in 2009.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
2008 Bottling equity income decreased 33%,  primarily reflecting a non-cash charge of $138 million related to our share of PBG is restructuring and impairment charges.  Additionally,  lower pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock contributed to the decline.  Net interest expense increased $189 million,  primarily reflecting higher average debt balances and losses on investments used to economically hedge our deferred compensation costs,  partially offset by lower average rates on our borrowings.  The tax rate increased 09 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily due to $129 million of tax benefits recognized in the prior year related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters,  partially offset by lower taxes on foreign results in the current year.  Net income decreased 9% and the related net income per share decreased 6%.  The unfavorable net mark-to-market impact of our commodity hedges,  the absence of the tax benefits recognized in the prior year,  our increased restructuring and impairment charges and our share of PBG is restructuring and impairment charges collectively contributed 15 percentage points to both the decline in net income and net income per share.  Additionallynet income per share was favorably impacted by our share repurchases.  2007 Bottling equity income increased 1%,  reflecting higher earnings from our anchor bottlers,  partially offset by the impact of our reduced ownership level in 2007 and lower pre-tax gains on our sale of PBG stock.  Net interest expense increased $33 million,  primarily reflecting the impact of lower investment balances and higher average rates on our debt,  partially offset by higher average interest rates on our investments and lower average debt balances.  The tax rate increased 66 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison to the prior year is non-cash tax benefits.  Net income remained flat and the related net income per share increased 2%.  Our solid operating profit growth and favorable net mark-to-market impact were offset by unfavorable comparisons to the non-cash tax benefits and restructuring and impairment charges in the prior year.  These items affecting comparability reduced both net income performance and related net income per share growth by 10 percentage points.  Additionallynet income per share was favorably impacted by our share repurchases.  
Results of Operations Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions.  In additionour operating profit and growth,  excluding the impact of restructuring and impairment charges,  are not measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  However,  we believe investors should consider these measures as they are more indicative   of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operating results and trends.

Operating profit,  excluding restructuring and impairment charges,  grew 37%.  Our Liquidity and Capital Resources Global capital and credit markets,  including the commercial paper markets,  experienced in 2008 and continue to experience considerable volatility.  Despite this volatility,  we continue to have access to the capital and credit markets.  In addition,  we have revolving credit facilities that are discussed in Note 9.  We believe that our cash generating capability and financial conditiontogether with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing (including long-term debt financing which,  depending upon market conditions,  we intend to use to replace a portion of our commercial paper borrowings),  will be adequate to meet our operating,  investing and financing needs.  However,  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all.  In addition,  our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.

Our operating cash flow in 2008 reflects restructuring payments of $180 million,  including $159 million related to our Productivity for Growth program,  and pension and retiree medical contributions of $219 million,  of which $23 million were discretionary.  In 2007,  our operations provided $69 billion of cashcompared to $61 billion in 2006,  primarily reflecting solid business results.  Substantially all cash payments related to the Productivity for Growth program are expected to be paid by the end of 2009.  In addition,  in 2009,  we will make a $640 million after-tax discretionary contribution to our U.S.  pension plans.  Investing Activities In 2008,  we used $27 billion for our investing activities,  primarily reflecting $24 billion for capital spending and $19 billion for acquisitions.  Significant acquisitions included our joint acquisition with PBG of Lebedyansky in Russia and the acquisition of a snacks company in Serbia.  The use of cash was partially offset by net proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $13 billion and proceeds from sales of PBG and PAS stock of $358 million.  In 2007,  we used $37 billion for our investing activitiesreflecting capital spending of $24 billion and acquisitions of $13 billion.  Acquisitions included the remaining interest in a snacks joint venture in Latin America,  Naked Juice Company and Bluebird Foods,  and the acquisition of a minority interest in a juice company in the Ukraine through a joint venture with PAS.  Proceeds from our sale of PBG stock of $315 million were offset by net purchases of short-term investments of $383 million.  We expect a high-single-digit decrease in net capital spending in 2009.  In addition,  we do not anticipate cash proceeds in 2009 from sales of PBG and PAS stock due to the current capital market conditions.  Financing Activities In 2008,  we used $30 billion for our financing activities,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through common share repurchases of $47 billion and dividend payments of $25 billion.  The use of cash was partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt,  net of payments,  of $31 billion,  stock option proceeds of $620 million and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $445 million.

Use of Cash 
In 2007,  we used $40 billion for our financing activitiesprimarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through common share repurchases of $43 billion and dividend payments of $22 billion,  as well as net repayments of short-term borrowings of $395 million.  The use of cash was partially offset by stock option proceeds of $11 billion and net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $16 billion.  We annually review our capital structure with our Boardincluding our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  In the second quarter of 2008,  our Board of Directors approved a 13% dividend increase from $150 to $170 per share.  During the third quarter of 2008,  we completed our $85 billion repurchase program publicly announced on May 3,  2006 and expiring on June 302009 and began repurchasing shares under our $80 billion repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2007 and expiring on June 30,  2010.  The current $80 billion authorization has approximately $64 billion remaining for repurchase.  We have historically repurchased significantly more shares each year than we have issued under our stock-based compensation plans,  with average net annual repurchases of 18% of outstanding shares for the last five years.  In 2009,  we intend,  subject to market conditions,  to spend up to $25 billion repurchasing shares.

Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value,  and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  Howeverit is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  The table below reconciles the net cash provided by operating activities,  as reflected in our cash flow statement,  to our management operating cash flow.  2008 
Net cash provided by operating activities (a) Capital spending Sales of property,  plant and equipment 
Management operating cash flow 
Management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return approximately all of our management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Howeversee 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.

Credit Ratings Our debt ratings of Aa2 from Moody is and A+ from Standard & Poor is contribute to our ability to access global capital and credit markets.  We have maintained strong investment grade ratings for over a decade.  Each rating is considered strong investment grade and is in the first quartile of its respective ranking system.  These ratings also reflect the impact of our anchor bottlers' cash flows and debt.  Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 9 for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  However,  at the time of the separation of our bottling operations from us various guarantees were necessary to facilitate the transactions.  In 2008,  we extended our guarantee of a portion of Bottling Group LLC is long-term debt in connection with the refinancing of a corresponding portion of the underlying debt.  At December 272008,  we believe it is remote that these guarantees would require any cash payment.  We do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing or disclosing assets or liabilities.  See Note 9 for a description of our off-balance-sheet arrangements.

PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions 
Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In addition,  we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates based on our economic ownership interest.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Equity income or loss from our anchor bottlers is recorded as bottling equity income in our income statement.  Bottling equity income also includes any changes in our ownership interests of our anchor bottlers.  Bottling equity income includes $147 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG and PAS stock in 2008 and $174 million and $186 million of pre-tax gains on our sales of PBG stock in 2007 and 2006,  respectively.  See Note 8 for additional information on our significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Income or loss from other noncontrolled affiliates is recorded as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilitiesare included in cost of sales.  The costs of moving,  storing and delivering finished product are included in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  tax reserves,  stock-based compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands,  goodwill and other long-lived assets.  We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis using our historical experience,  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances,  such as current economic conditions,  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change.  As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
See 'Our Divisions" below and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results,  see 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless noted,  and are based on unrounded amounts.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the 2008 presentation.  Our Divisions We manufacture or use contract manufacturers,  market and sell a variety of salty,  convenient,  sweet and grain-based snackscarbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  and foods in approximately 200 countries with our largest operations in North America (United States and Canada),  Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions.  For additional unaudited information on our divisionssee 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for the following allocation methodologies: 	 stock-based compensation expense	 pension and retiree medical expense,  and 	 derivatives.  Stock-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2008 was approximately 29% to FLNA,  4% to QFNA,  7% to LAF,  23% to PAB,  13% to UKEU13% to MEAA and 11% to corporate unallocated expenses.  We had similar allocations of stock-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2007 and 2006.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at a fixed discount rate,  as well as amortization of gains and losses due to demographics,  including salary experience,  are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate for retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension planspension asset returns and the impact of pension funding,  and gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  In addition,  corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the Plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7.  Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include energy,  fruit and other raw materials.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  These derivatives hedge underlying 
commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  division results reflect the contract purchase price of these commodities.  In 2007,  we expanded our commodity hedging program to include derivative contracts used to mitigate our exposure to price changes associated with our purchases of fruit.  In addition,  in 2008,  we entered into additional contracts to further reduce our exposure to price fluctuations in our raw material and energy costs.  The majority of these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in divisional results.

Note 2 Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and outof-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customers,  Wal-Mart and PBG.  In 2008,  Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 12% of our total net revenueincluding concentrate sales to our bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart; and PBG represented approximately 8%.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to our customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $125 billion in 2008,  $113 billion in 2007 and $101 billion in 2006.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rightsmay extend beyond one year.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $333 million at December 27,  2008 and $314 million at December 29,  2007 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Other marketplace spending,  which includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities,  totaled $29 billion in 2008,  $29 billion in 2007 and $27 billion in 2006 and is reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Included in these 
amounts were advertising expenses of $18 billion in both 2008 and 2007 and $16 billion in 2006.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: 	 media and personal service prepayments	 promotional materials in inventory,  and 	 production costs of future media advertising.  Deferred advertising costs of $172 million and $160 million at year-end 2008 and 2007,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $53 billion in 2008,  $51 billion in 2007 and $46 billion in 2006.  Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less which we do not intend to rollover beyond three months.  Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software,  (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which approximate five to ten years.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $940 million at December 27,  2008 and $761 million at December 29,  2007.  Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  certain taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities.  These activities principally involve the development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing productsimprovement and modernization of production processes,  and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $388 million in 2008$364 million in 2007 and $282 million in 2006 and are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: 	 Property,  Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets Note 4and for additional unaudited information on brands and goodwill,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.

Financial Instruments Note 10,  and for additional unaudited information,  see 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS 159 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  We adopted SFAS 159 as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year and our adoption did not impact our financial statements.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS 141R,  to improvesimplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations.  SFAS 141R continues the movement toward the greater use of fair value in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures.  It changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods.  The provisions of SFAS 141R are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year,  with the exception of adjustments made to 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.  Adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year would apply the provisions of SFAS 141R.  Future adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year would apply the provisions of SFAS 141R and will be evaluated based on the outcome of these matters.  We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS 160.  SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries.  The provisions of SFAS 160 are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year on a prospective basis.  We do not expect our adoption of SFAS 160 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  In the first quarter of 2009,  we will include the required disclosures for all periods presented.  In March 2008,  the FASB issued SFAS 161 which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133 to provide an enhanced understanding of the use of derivative instrumentshow they are accounted for under SFAS 133 and their effect on financial position,  financial performance and cash flows.  The disclosure provisions of SFAS 161 are effective as of the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year.  
Note 3 Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
2008 Restructuring and Impairment Charge In 2008,  we incurred a charge of $543 million ($408 million after-tax or $025 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program.  The program includes actions in all divisions of the business that we believe will increase cost competitiveness across the supply chain,  upgrade and streamline our product portfolio,  and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.  Approximately $455 million of the charge was recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenseswith the remainder recorded in cost of sales.  Substantially all cash payments related to this charge are expected to be paid by the end of 2009.

The charge was comprised of $43 million of asset impairments,  $14 million of severance and other employee costs and $10 million of other costs.  Severance and other employee costs primarily reflect the termination costs for approximately 380 employees.  All cash payments related to this charge were paid by the end of 2007.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years,  based on average 2008 foreign exchange rates,  is expected to be $64 million in 2009,  $63 million in 2010,  $62 million in 2011,  $60 million in 2012 and $56 million in 2013.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on dis counted future cash flows.  Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.  For additional unaudited information on our amortizable brand policies,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Nonamortizable Intangible Assets Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  No impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations.  The change in the book value of nonamortizable intangible assets is as follows: BalanceBeginning 2007

For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies,  including our reserves for income taxes,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  In 2007,  we recognized $129 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters.  In 2006,  we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $602 millionsubstantially all of which related to the IRS is examination of our consolidated income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2002.  Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: 	 U.S.  continue to dispute one matter related to tax years 1998 through 2002.  Our U.S.  tax returns for the years 2003 through 2005 are currently under audit.  In 2008,  the IRS   initiated its audit of our U.S.  tax returns for the years 2006 through 2007; 	 Mexico audits have been substantially completed for all   taxable years through 2005; 	 United Kingdom audits have been completed for all taxable years prior to 2004; and 	 Canada audits have been completed for all taxable years through 2005.  We are in agreement with the conclusionsexcept for one matter which we continue to dispute.  The Canadian tax return for 2006 is currently under audit.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interestin light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results. " In 2006,  the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.  48Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No.  109,  (FIN 48),  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.  FIN 48 requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position,  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,  based on the technical merits of the position.  We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year.  As of December 27,  2008,  the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilities,  was $17 billion.  Any prospective adjustments to these reserves will be recorded as an increase or decrease to our provision for income taxes and would impact our effective tax rate.  In addition,  we accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in sellinggeneral and administrative expenses.  The gross amount of interest accrued,  reported in other liabilities,  was $427 million as of December 27,  2008,  of which $95 million was recognized in 2008.  The gross amount of interest accrued was $338 million as of December 29,  2007,  of which $34 million was recognized in 2007.

Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $72 billion at year-end 2008 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $03 billion in 2009,  $62 billion between 2010 and 2028 and $07 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Undistributed International Earnings At December 27,  2008,  we had approximately $171 billion of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  therefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  
Note 6 Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  A majority of our employees participate in our stock-based compensation program.  This program includes both our broad-based SharePower program which was established in 1989 to grant an annual award of stock options to eligible employees,  based upon job level or classification and tenure (internationally),  as well as our executive long-term awards program.  Stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  our only active stock-based plan.  Stock-based compensation expense was $238 million in 2008,  $260 million in 2007 and $270 million in 2006.  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $71 million in 2008,  $77 million in 2007 and $80 million in 2006.  Stock-based compensation cost capitalized in connection with our ongoing business transformation initiative was $4 million in 2008,  $3 million in 2007 and $3 million in 2006.  At year-end 2008,  57 million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.  
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options,  which include grants under our executive program and our broad-based SharePower program,  under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  We do not backdatereprice or grant stock-based compensation awards retroactively.  Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and are granted 50% stock options and 50% performancebased RSUs.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of pre-established performance targets approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  RSU expense is based on the fair value of PepsiCo stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Each RSU is settled in a share of our stock after the vesting period.  Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: Expected life Risk free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.  Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income,  share repurchases and stock price.

Note 7  Pension,  Retiree Medical and Savings Plans 
Our pension plans cover full-time employees in the U.S.  and   certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder   of the costs.  Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions,  including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets,  and from changes in our assumptions are also determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year.  The cost or benefit   of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in   earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining   
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 12 years for retiree medical expense.  On December 30,  2006,  we adopted SFAS 158.  In connection with our adoption,  we recognized the funded status of our Plans on our balance sheet as of December 30,  2006 with subsequent changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive income in the years in which they occur.  In accordance with SFAS 158amounts prior to the year of adoption have not been adjusted.  SFAS 158 also required that,  no later than 2008,  our assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense be determined as of the balance sheet date,  and all plan assets and liabilities be reported as of that date.  Accordingly,  as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year,  we changed the measurement date for our annual pension and retiree medical expense and all plan assets and liabilities from September 30 to our year-end   balance sheet date.  As a result of this change in measurement date,  we recorded an after-tax $39 million decrease to 2008 opening shareholders' equity,  as follows: Pension

PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Future Benefit Payments and Funding Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: Pension Retiree medical (a) 
(a)	 Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act.  Subsidies are expected to be approximately $10 million for each of the years from 2009 through 2013 and approximately $70 million in total for 2014 through 2018.  
These future benefits to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded pension plans.  In 2009,  we will make pension contributions of up to $11 billion,  with up to $1 billion being discretionary.  Our net cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be approximately $100 million in 2009.  Pension Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of activelymanaged securities and is reviewed annually based upon plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in high-quality and diversified equity and debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  We employ certain equity strategies which,  in addition to investments in U.S.  and international common and preferred stockinclude investments in certain equity- and debt-based securities used collectively to generate returns in excess of certain equitybased indices.  Debt-based securities represent approximately 3% and 30% of our equity strategy portfolio as of year-end 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%reflecting estimated long-term rates of return of 89% from our equity strategies,  and 63% from our fixed income strategies.  Our target investment allocation is 60% for equity strategies and 40% for fixed income strategies.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  Our actual pension plan asset allocations are as follows: Actual Allocation Asset Category 
Equity strategies Fixed income strategies Other,  primarily cash Total 
The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  we use a market-related valuation method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets) for securities included in our equity strategies over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  For all other asset categories,  the actual fair value is used for the market-related value of assets.  Pension assets include 55 million shares of PepsiCo common stock with a market value of $302 million in 2008,  and 55 million shares with a market value of $401 million in 2007.  Our investment policy limits the investment in PepsiCo stock at the time of investment to 10% of the fair value of plan assets.  Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 80% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2009.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2014 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability.  However,  the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.  A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects: 2008 service and interest cost components 2008 benefit liability 
Savings Plan Our U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans,  which are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement.  We make matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  In 2008 and 2007our matching contributions were $70 million and $62 millionrespectively.

Our investment in PBG,  which includes the related goodwillwas $536 million and $507 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PBG shares at year-end 2008,  the calculated market value of our shares in PBG exceeded our investment balance,  excluding our investment in Bottling Group,  LLC,  by approximately $567 million.  Additionally,  in 2007,  we formed a joint venture with PBGcomprising our concentrate and PBG is bottling businesses in Russia.  PBG holds a 60% majority interest in the joint venture and consolidates the entity.  We account for our interest of 40% under the equity method of accounting.  During 2008,  together with PBG,  we jointly acquired Russia is leading branded juice company,  Lebedyansky.  Lebedyansky is owned 25% and 75% by PBG and us,  respectively.

Our investment in PAS,  which includes the related goodwillwas $318 million and $303 million higher than our ownership interest in their net assets at year-end 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted closing price of PAS shares at year-end 2008,  the calculated market value of our shares in PAS exceeded our investment balance by approximately $143 million.  Additionally,  in 2007,  we completed the joint purchase of Sandora,  LLC,  a juice company in the Ukraine,  with PAS.  PAS holds a 60% majority interest in the joint venture and consolidates the entity.  We account for our interest of 40% under the equity method of accounting.  Related Party Transactions Our significant related party transactions include our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  We sell concentrate to these affiliateswhich they use in the production of CSDs and non-carbonated beverages.  We also sell certain finished goods to these affiliatesand we receive royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products.  Sales of concentrate and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding.  For further unaudited information on these bottlers,  see 'Our Customers" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows: Net revenue Selling,  general and administrative expenses Accounts and notes receivable Accounts payable and other current liabilities 
Such amounts are settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables.  See Note 9 regarding our guarantee of certain PBG debt.  In addition,  we coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the contract negotiations of sweeteners and other raw material requirements for certain of our bottlers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting party,  we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.

The interest rates in the above table reflect weighted-average rates at year-end.  
In the second quarter of 2008,  we issued $175 billion of senior unsecured notes,  maturing in 2018.  We entered into an interest rate swap,  maturing in 2018,  to effectively convert the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5% to a variable rate based on LIBOR.  The proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used for general corporate purposes,  including the repayment of outstanding short-term indebtedness.  In the third quarter of 2008,  we updated our U.S.  $25 billion euro medium term note program following the expiration of the existing program.  Under the program,  we may issue unsecured notes under mutually agreed upon terms with the purchasers of the notes.  Proceeds from any issuance of notes may be used for general corporate purposes,  except as otherwise specified in the related prospectus.  As of December 27,  2008,  we had no outstanding notes under the program.  
In the fourth quarter of 2008,  we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes,  bearing interest at 790% per year and maturing in 2018.  We used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes,  including the repayment of outstanding short-term indebtedness.  Additionally,  in the fourth quarter of 2008,  we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement which enables us to borrow up to $18 billion,  subject to customary terms and conditions,  and expires in December 2009.  This agreement replaced a $1 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement we entered into during the third quarter of 2008.  Funds borrowed under this agreement may be used to repay outstanding commercial paper issued by us or our subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes,  including working capital,  capital investments and acquisitions.  This line of credit remained unused as of December 27,  2008.  This 364-day credit agreement is in addition to our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement.  Funds borrowed under this agreement may be used for general corporate purposes,  including supporting our outstanding commercial paper issuances.  This agreement expires in 2012.  This line of credit remains unused as of December 27,  2008.  As of December 27,  2008,  we have reclassified $13 billion of short-term debt to long-term based on our intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis.  In addition,  as of December 27,  2008,  $844 million of our debt related to borrowings from various lines of credit that are maintained for our international divisions.  These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed to the extent of our borrowings.  Interest Rate Swaps In connection with the issuance of the $175 billion notes in the second quarter of 2008,  we entered into an interest rate swapmaturing in 2018,  to effectively convert the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5% to a variable rate based on LIBOR.  In addition,  in connection with the issuance of the $1 billion senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2007,  we entered into an interest rate swap,  maturing in 2012,  to effectively convert the interest rate from a fixed rate of 515% to a variable rate based on LIBOR.  The terms of the swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps outstanding at December 27,  2008 and December 29,  2007 were $275 billion and $1 billion,  respectively.

See Note 7 regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations and discussion below regarding our commitments to noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  However,  at the time of the separation of our bottling operations from us various guarantees were necessary to facilitate the transactions.  We have guaranteed an aggregate of $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt ($10 billion of which matures in 2012 and $13 billion of which matures in 2014).  In the fourth quarter of 2008,  we extended our guarantee of $13 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt in connection with the refinancing of a corresponding portion of the underlying 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
debt.  The terms of our Bottling Group,  LLC debt guarantee are intended to preserve the structure of PBG is separation from us and our payment obligation would be triggered if Bottling GroupLLC failed to perform under these debt obligations or the structure significantly changed.  At December 27,  2008,  we believe it is remote that these guarantees would require any cash payment.  See Note 8 regarding contracts related to certain of our bottlers.  See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Note 10 Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 	 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy	 foreign exchange risks,  and 	 interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a result,  any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related gain or loss and include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction,  we recognize the related gain or loss in net income in that period.  
We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform a quarterly assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  including a review of credit ratingscredit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  We consider this risk to be low,  because we limit our exposure to individual,  strong creditworthy counterparties and generally settle on a net basis.  Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders,  pricing agreements,  geographic diversity and derivatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for natural gas and diesel fuel.  For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  However,  such commodity cash flow hedges have not had any significant ineffectiveness for all periods presented.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $64 million related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market each period and reflected in our income statement.  In 2007,  we expanded our commodity hedging program to include derivative contracts used to mitigate our exposure to price changes associated with our purchases of fruit.  In additionin 2008,  we entered into additional contracts to further reduce our exposure to price fluctuations in our raw material and energy costs.  The majority of these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are then subsequently reflected in divisional results.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $303 million at December 27,  2008 and $5 million at December 29,  2007.  These contracts resulted in net unrealized losses of $117 million at December 27,  2008 and net unrealized gains of less than $1 million at December 29,  2007.  
Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $626 million at December 27,  2008 and $105 million at December 29,  2007.  These contracts resulted in net losses of $343 million in 2008 and net gains of $3 million in 2007.  Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 48% of our net revenue,  with Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising 19% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  On occasion,  we enter into hedges,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rates.  Ineffectiveness of these hedges has not been material.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We may use interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Our 2008 and 2007 interest rate swaps were entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they modified.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Fair Value In September 2006,  the FASB issued SFAS 157,  Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157),  which defines fair value,  establishes a framework for measuring fair value,  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The provisions of SFAS 157 were effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.  However,  the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157,  until the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year,  as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.  These include goodwill,  other nonamortizable intangible assets and unallocated purchase price for recent acquisitions which are included within other assets.  We adopted SFAS 157 at the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year and our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities.  Level 1 provides 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2008 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the most reliable measure of fair value,  whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.  The three levels are defined as follows: 	 Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  	 Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1.  For example,  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.  	 Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management is own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.  The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are categorized as follows: 2008

(c)	 Based on observable market transactions of spot and forward rates.  The 2008 asset includes $27 million related to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the 2008 liability includes $55 million related to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Derivative instruments are recognized on our balance sheet in current assets,  current liabilities,  other assets or other liabilities at fair value.  The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to the short term maturity.  Short-term investments consist principally of short-term time deposits and index funds of $98 million at December 27,  2008 and $189 million at December 29,  2007 used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.  Under SFAS 157,  the fair value of our debt obligations as of December 27,  2008 was $88 billion,  based upon prices of similar instruments in the market place.  The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 29,  2007 was $44 billion.  The table above excludes guarantees,  including our guarantee aggregating $23 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC is long-term debt.  The guarantee had a fair value of $117 million at December 272008 and $35 million at December 29,  2007 based on our estimate of the cost to us of transferring the liability to an independent financial institution.  See Note 9 for additional information on our guarantees.  
Note 11 Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 98 million shares in 200827 million shares in 2007 and 01 million shares in 2006 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.  Out-of-themoney options had average exercise prices of $6759 in 2008$6518 in 2007 and $6524 in 2006.
