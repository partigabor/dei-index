Dear Fellow Shareholders Indra K.  Nooyi PepsiCo Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 
PepsiCo delivered another year of strong performance in 2014,  resulting in double-digit total shareholder returns.  As 2015 heralds our company is 50th anniversary,  I want to take this opportunity to share my thoughts on what has made PepsiCo one of the top-performing food and beverage companies of the past 50 years,  and the steps we are taking to extend this legacy of success for decades to come.  
Looking Back: Our Half-Century Journey As we prepare to celebrate PepsiCo is 50th year in June,  we look back at our journey with pride.  In 1965,  when the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-LayInc.  merged to create PepsiCo,  our revenue was $510 million.  Todayit stands at more than $66 billion.  Our market capitalization,  which was $842 million at the end of 1965grew to $141 billion at the end of 2014,  putting us in the top 10% of the S&P 500 by market value.  If you invested $100 in PepsiCo stock at the end of 1965,  it was worth nearly $43000 at the end of 2014,  a 132% annualized return. 1 A $100 investment in the S&P 500 over the same time period was worth nearly $10000 at the end of 2014,  a 98% annualized return.  
1.  For further information,  please see pages 2 and 3.  
Two core attributes of PepsiCo underlie our strong outperformance: 	 Adaptability: We anticipated major shifts in the consumer landscape and business environment and met them head-on by preemptively retooling the company for advantage and growth.  	 Performance: At the same time that we have been driving sometimes radical change,  we have managed to deliver strong financial results over the long term.  I am confident that these attributes will continue to define our company for the next 50 years.  The 'Adaptable" Corporation Throughout the past half-centuryPepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio,  build new ­capabilities and invest in new geographies.  I'd like to share with you four major trends and how we adapted in order to thrive.

Trend 1: The Growth of the Middle Class ​ The past few decades saw the rise of the middle class and the growth of women in the workforce across the globe.  Concurrently,  as consumers worldwide shifted more of their spending to higher-quality products,  they favored companies that could deliver these products through strong,  trusted brands.  PepsiCo acted decisively to capitalize on this trend.  We globalized our footprint to meet consumers' quest for convenience around the world,  as most of our products can go from package to consumption in seconds.  And we established our trusted brands in each of our major markets.  Our portfolio of 22 power brands that each generate more than $1 billion in estimated annual retail salesand more than 10 brands that each generate between $500 million and $1 billion in estimated annual retail sales,  is synonymous with quality,  great taste and affordability.  Globalizing the company and connecting our brands with consumers around the world has,  without question,  helped drive significant growth for PepsiCo during our first half-century.  Trend 2: The Evolution of the Retail Environment The global retail environment changed dramatically over the past decades.  Around the world,  we witnessed the emergence of organized,  efficient,  modern trade in many countries,  followed by increasing consolidation and sophistication of retailers in each market.  
Throughout this transformation,  we understood the paramount importance of remaining a key partner to our large retail customers,  while continuing to provide the best service to smaller stores.  When PepsiCola and Frito-Lay joined forces,  it brought together two high-velocity categories under one umbrella and allowed PepsiCo to match retailers' growing scale with our own.  Additionally,  we have constantly retooled our direct store delivery (DSD) selling system to provide excellent service to large and small retailers alike.  Thanks in large part to our company is focus on the transforming retail environmentin 2014 PepsiCo was the number one food and beverage business in the U.S.,  CanadaRussia,  India,  Saudi Arabia and Egypt,  and among the top three in the U.K.,  Mexico and Turkey,  to name a few. 2 Trend 3: The Acceleration of Consumer Focus on Health and Wellness The emergence and acceleration of consumers' focus on health and wellness (more recently also a focal point of government regulations) has increasingly challenged companies with Fun-For-You portfolios to adapt their products.  At the same time,  this trend has also created significant growth opportunities in the Better-For-You and Good-For-You categories.  PepsiCo anticipated this shift early on,  and we took steps to future-proof our portfolio.  We invested in research and development to improve the nutritional value and increase the appeal of our Fun-For-You products by eliminating trans fats and reducing salt,  fat and added sugar content in key brands.  We preemptively acquired major brands across the Good-For-You space,  including Quaker Oats,  Gatorade for athletes,  TropicanaNaked Juice and the Wimm-Bill-Dann line of dairy and juice products in Russia.  We also created a nutrition group to grow our GoodFor-You portfolio.  In 2014,  our nutrition businesses accounted for approximately 20% of PepsiCo is net revenue.  We are one of the top companies in the world in the growing everyday nutrition space.

Future-Proofing Our Portfolio 
Trend 4: The War for Talent PepsiCo proudly serves consumers of every income group and ethnicity,  on every continent,  and in intensely competitive markets.  We also know that women make the majority of food and beverage buying decisions.  Understanding how to meet the needs of such a diverse cross-section of global consumers requires a diverse and talented workforce.  PepsiCo committed long ago to attracting the best and brightest from the entire pool of available talent and to building a workforce that reflects the diversity of the consumers we serve.  There are many 'firsts" in our talent diversity journey.  Pepsi broke the color barrier in the U.S.  in the 1940s by hiring African-American sales people.  We shattered the glass ceiling when we appointed a woman to our Board of Directors in the 1950s.  We made history again in 1962 when Harvey C.  Russell became the first African-American Vice President of any major U.S.  corporation.  Our proud legacy of diversity and inclusion continues to this day.  It is our strength.  IndeedPepsiCo is focus on a diverse and inclusive workforce has only heightened in recent years,  as the war for talent among leading,  global companies has escalated.  Today,  an essential part of our commitment to diversity is growing the participation of women in business and empowering women in local communities.  In Saudi Arabia,  for example,  our team has actively recruited women to PepsiCo for 
both management and frontline roles,  establishing workplaces that respect local customs and developing specialized training programs.  Women have assumed leadership roles across the company.  Globally,  approximately 30% of PepsiCo is executives are women,  and women comprised 38% of our Board of Directors in 2014.  (Additional details on our diversity and inclusion programs can be found in PepsiCo is most recent Global Reporting Initiative report on our website. ) Developing New Capabilities In addition to adapting the company to benefit from and capitalize on these megatrends,  we have deliberately developed new capabilities to compete in the rapidly evolving global business environment in which we operate.  For example: 	 We transformed our operating model from a highly decentralized and local one to a judicious blend of global leverage and local execution.  This has allowed PepsiCo to effectively utilize our scale to deliver productivity yet retain agility by enabling individual country teams to make rapid decisions in serving local consumers and retailers.  Our five-year,  $5 billion productivity program announced in 2014 was made possible largely by this new operating model.  Importantlyit has increased our ability to lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world in areas such as consumer insights We continue to build capabilities to pursue growth opportunities in categories such as fruits and vegetableswhole grains,  proteinsports nutrition and hydration.  
Embracing Design

innovation,  revenue management,  customer business planning and DSD systems.  Our stepped-up innovation performance,  where innovation as a percentage of sales has substantially increased,  is due to our rapid global deployment and adaptation of new ideas and platforms.  	 We embraced design as a core building block of innovation.  By creating a world-class design studio and staffing it with the best and brightest from around the globe,  we have begun to embed design early in the innovation process in order to influence product and packaging development in its formative stages.  One example is Pepsi Spire,  our revolutionary new beverage dispensing system — ​a groundbreaking design-driven innovation that has contributed to the growth of our Foodservice business.  	 We revamped PepsiCo University to harmonize our course offerings around the world — ​both to train our people on the 'PepsiCo Way of Working" and to ensure they have the skills to continue to lead PepsiCo.  Additionally,  we revised our talent assessment tools,  talent planning and development process,  and compensation structure — ​all to attract and retain top talent and align our reward system with shareholder interests.  These defining characteristics of adaptabilitycourage to act preemptively,  and resilience are why PepsiCo is one of only 77 publicly traded companies remaining from the Fortune 500 in 1965.  Of these 
77 companies,  PepsiCo ranks in the top quartile in Total Shareholder Returns3  — ​a performance history we reflect on with pride as we celebrate our 50th year.  2014 — ​A Strong Performance Year PepsiCo delivered strong performance in 2014­meeting or exceeding all of our full-year financial targets. 4 	 Organic revenue grew 4%,  with PepsiCo outpacing other Consumer Packaged Goods ­companies in organic revenue growth. 5 	 Core gross margins improved by 55 basis points,  and core operating margins improved by 30 basis points.  	 Core net return on invested capital (ROIC) improved 110 basis points,  to 175%.  	 Core constant currency earnings per share (EPS) grew 9%.  	 Free cash flow excluding certain items was strong at $83 billion.

	 PepsiCo increased its annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year in 2014 and returned $87 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends,  a 36% increase over 2013.  While delivering this strong financial performance,  we continue to deliver progress on the fundamental global capabilities that underpin our long-term competitiveness and resilience in the transformation journey we have been on.  First,  our investment in innovation resulted in strong retail sales in North America.  Thanks to our world-class research and development capabilities and the strength of our new product pipelineinnovation accounted for more than 9% of our net revenue in 2014,  versus more than 7% in 2012.  These efforts,  combined with new best-in-class selling tools and technologies,  made PepsiCo the largest contributor to U.S.  retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers,  with nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth in all measured channels — ​more than the next 27 largest manufacturers combined. 6

In fact,  we had 10 of the top 50 new food and beverage product launches in North America in 20147 Second,  we continued to benefit from our aggressive productivity culture and mindset.  We delivered $1 billion of productivity savings,  meeting our three-year,  $3 billion productivity target for 2012– 2014.  As announced in early 2014,  we extended our annual productivity savings target of $1 billion through 2019.  Third,  we continued to invest in the talent we need to lead our business forward.  We created accelerated leadership programs to train leaders for the new global realities; we brought in new talent in areas we believed needed new thinking; and we continued our focus on programs to retain high-potential talent.  In 2014,  it was gratifying to see the benefits of all our talent management activities — ​especially in the area of diversity and inclusion — ​reflected in numerous talent rankings: 	 The Hay Group is Best Companies for Leadership 	 Universum is World is Most Attractive Employers 	 Black Enterprise is Best Companies for Diversity 	 The Corporate Equality Index (which gave PepsiCo a 100% rating) 	 Working Mother is Best Companies for Multicultural Women 	 The LATINA Style 50 	 Top Employer Institute recognized PepsiCo FoodsGreater China Region,  as Top Employer 	 The Australian Government is Workplace Gender Equality Agency named PepsiCo Australia 'Employer of Choice for Gender Equality"

Building Our Digital Capabilities 
Looking Forward: Sustaining PepsiCo is Resilient Outperformance in the Coming Decades The environment in which PepsiCo competes will continue to evolve and change.  And we will continue to preemptively adapt and position the company for long-term advantage and sustained growth while delivering strong financial results.  Future forces The four defining trends described earlier — ​the continued rebalancing of the economic world through the rise of the middle class and womenthe transformation of the retail environment,  the acceleration of consumer focus on health and wellness,  and the war for talent — ​will almost certainly increase in intensity in the years ahead.  We will continue to adapt to and capitalize on these trends.  At the same time,  over the next decade and beyondwe believe three additional trends will increasingly impact the food and beverage industry: 1. 	 The rise of the digitally savvy consumershopper and the emergence of e-commerce as a new distribution channel for foods and beverages.  2. 	The growing pressure on businesses to be a more active force for change in addressing their environmental and social impacts.  3. 	The heightened role values,  ethics and corporate governance will play in enabling companies to survive and thrive.  
How we are adapting Investing in new digital capabilities Social media and mobile technology are disrupting old ways of doing business,  but they are also creating new opportunities for manufacturers,  retailers,  shoppers and consumers to interact.  PepsiCo is embracing this shift by investing in three core digital capabilities to support our continued growth.  First,  a growing percentage of our advertising and marketing spend is now dedicated to digital platforms as consumers dramatically change the way they engage with media.  We are leveraging Facebook,  Twitter,  Instagram and other channels in innovative ways to produce compelling contentdrive engagement and build brand equity.  We are also partnering with our retail customers on programs linking to their social media platformsallowing us to reach the right consumers at the right time with the right offerings.  Second,  our increased investment in digital is creating unique opportunities for two-way dialogue with consumers.  For instance,  through our Lay is 'Do Us a Flavor" campaign,  we engaged consumers online to co-create innovative new products and content that drives our brands.  In China,  Mirinda invited consumers through social media to team up with celebrities in a brand-owned variety show to campaign and battle for a best new flavor.  And our Doritos 'Crash the Super Bowl" contest received nearly 5000 consumer submissions from 
PepsiCo is responding to the growing demand for food and beverages purchased online.  In China,  for example,  our 'Click & Mix" innovation provides a broad and unique assortment of products customized for our consumersand it leverages event-driven marketing relevant to national occasions,  such as the Chinese New Year.  Shown above: A 'Click & Mix" gift box.  
Lay is 'Do Us A Flavor" in the U.S.  attracted more than 14 million submissions.  
 Special Thank You 
PepsiCo is built on the unshakable foundation of our company is longstanding commitment to transparencyengagement and the highest ethical conduct.  
29 countries,  all vying for a chance to have their homemade commercial featured during Super Bowl XLIX.  Lastly,  we are committed to shaping how this new ecosystem of digital,  mobile,  customer and consumer converges in the world of e-commerce.  To that endwe are building new global e-commerce capabilities to accelerate our trajectory across this fast-growing channel.  This involves retooling the form and function of our products,  our packaging structures,  and our fulfillment models.  Enhancing our commitment to sustainability ​ We have made significant strides in integrating sustainability into every aspect of our enterprise.  And our journey continues.  When I first articulated Performance with Purpose in 2006,  sustainability was largely viewed as tangential to business,  and it was often equated with 'giving back" through philanthropy and volunteerism.  My motivation was different: to change how we made our money,  not what we did with the money we made.  Over the past eight years,  Performance with Purpose has guided our initiatives.  It has inspired us to grow our top line by expanding the range of nutritious and delicious products we offer to consumers.  It has spurred us to minimize our environmental footprint — ​and operating costs — ​by pioneering new systems that conserve natural resources.  And it has led us to continually attractmotivate and inspire our associates by providing a safe and inclusive workplace and enabling them to grow professionally while living their values.  Together,  PepsiCo is businesses have demonstrated that a clear,  focused sustainability agenda can create shareholder value.  Performance with Purpose continues to position PepsiCo for sustainable financial performance for years to come by aligning what is good for our business with what is good for society and the planet.  Maintaining our commitment to strong and transparent corporate governance PepsiCo is built on the unshakable foundation of our company is long-standing commitment to transparency,  engagement and the highest ethical conduct.  We have an actively engaged Board comprised of directors with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.  In addition 
to informing and strengthening our global businesses,  our Board has adopted governance practices that protect the rights of our investors and foster independent thinking as well as alignment with our shareholders in the boardroom.  Over the yearsthrough open communication with shareholders and stakeholders alike,  we have earned the trust and respect of our investors,  business partners and the general public.  This ethos of integrity and strong corporate governance is at the heart of all we do.  I am very pleased to report that we were once again recognized as best-in-class in 2014: 	 PepsiCo was named as one of the World is Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the eighth consecutive year.  	 Corporate Secretary magazine honored PepsiCo for Best Shareholder Engagement.  	 PepsiCo won Best Governance,  Risk and Compliance Program at a Large-Cap Company at the New York Stock Exchange Governance Services' inaugural Governance,  Risk & Compliance Leadership Awards.  	 PepsiCo was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the ninth consecutive yearand to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the eighth consecutive year.  
Proud to Look Back,  Eager to Move Forward Reflecting on PepsiCo is 50-year journey,  I am struck by how our company has touched countless lives and has been shaped by countless hands.  Thanks are in order.  First and foremost,  I would like to express my deep gratitude to our consumers,  who continue to inspire PepsiCo to greatness as we strive to meet their evolving needs and brighten their days with products that nourish and delight.  I am also deeply grateful to our foodservice and retail partners around the world for their collaboration,  commitment to excellence,  and dedication to consistently delivering for our consumers,  day in and day out.  Each and every day,  I draw inspiration and energy from my fellow PepsiCo associates around the world.  They have been steadfast in their commitment to our business,  and the success PepsiCo has achieved over the past half-century is thanks to their determination,  sacrifice and deep love for our company.  All of us at PepsiCo owe a great debt to the four Chief Executive Officers who preceded me — ​Steven S.  Reinemund,  Roger A.  Enrico D.  Wayne Calloway and Donald M.  Kendall.  Each left a special mark on our company.  Today,  we carry the journey forward with the wisdom and dedication of our Board of Directors,  under whose oversight I am honored to serve.  Finally,  let me express my profound thanks to our long-term shareholders.  I am grateful for your far-sighted investment and continued trust in our company,  and I am gratified that we have been able to amply reward both.  It is my great privilege to lead this company and to help write the next chapter in our proud history.  I look to PepsiCo is future with tremendous confidence in and commitment to the values and ethos that have driven our success for the past five decades.  My optimism for our next 50 years knows no bounds.

Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute 'forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act).  Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as 'aim, " 'anticipate, " 'believe, " 'drive, " 'estimate, " 'expect, " 'expressed confidence, " 'forecast, " 'future, " 'goals, " 'guidance, " 'intend, " 'may, " 'objectives, " 'outlook, " 'plan, " 'position, " 'potential, " 'project, "  iseek, "  ishould, "  istrategy, " 'target, " 'will" or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions.

Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD),  customer warehouse and distributor networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needs,  product characteristics and local trade practices.  Direct-Store-Delivery We,  our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages,  foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers.  DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishableand have lower turnover.  Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors.  Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles.  For example,  our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages,  foods and snacks to restaurants,  businesses,  schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage,  food and snack products are apple,  orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates,  aspartame,  corn,  corn sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruit and other fruits,  oats,  oranges,  potatoes,  raw milk,  rice,  seasonings,  sucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils,  and wheat.  We also use water in the manufacturing of our products.  Our key packaging materials include plastic resins,  including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles,  closures,  cardboard and paperboard cartons.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and in the trucks delivering our products.  We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages.  Many of these ingredients,  raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market.  The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuationand we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,  pricing agreements and derivative instruments,  including swaps and futures.  In addition,  risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.  When prices increase,  we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers.  See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs.  See also 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors – Our business,  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costsdisruption of supply or shortages of raw materials or other supplies.

We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets,  including Dole and Ocean Spray.  We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks,  Muscle Milk protein shakes and certain DPSG brands,  including Dr PepperCrush and Schweppes,  in certain markets.  Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks,  such as Lipton,  Müller,  Sabra and Starbucks.  Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes,  and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks.  We have authorized,  through licensing arrangements,  the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments.  In addition,  we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail,  which enhances brand awareness.  We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products,  their packaging,  the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses.  Some of these patents are licensed to others.  See also 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors Our intellectual property rights could be infringed or challenged and reduce the value of our products and brands and have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations.  For instance,  our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months.  Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.  However,  taken as a whole,  seasonality does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.  Our Customers Our primary customers include wholesale and other distributors,  foodservice customers,  grocery stores,  drug stores,  convenience stores,  discount/dollar stores,  mass merchandisers,  membership stores and authorized independent bottlers.  We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area.  These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate,  finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality.  We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.  Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  For our independent distributors and retailersthese incentives include volume-based rebates,  product placement fees,  promotions and displays.  For our independent bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentives,  advertising supportnew product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include couponspricing discounts and promotions,  and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media.  New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-of-purchase materials,  product placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  6

Changes to the retail landscape,  including increased consolidation of retail ownership,  and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  See 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors – The loss of any key customer or changes to the retail landscape could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " In 2014,  sales to Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  (Wal-Mart),  including Sam is Club (Sam is),  represented approximately 12% of our total net revenue.  Our top five retail customers represented approximately 31% of our 2014 North American (United States and Canada) net revenue,  with Wal-Mart (including Sam is) representing approximately 18%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers,  which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our customers,  including our independent bottlers.  Our Competition Our beverage,  food and snack products are in highly competitive industries and markets and compete against products of international beverage,  food and snack companies that,  like us,  operate in multiple geographiesas well as regional,  local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  In many countries in which our products are sold,  including the United States,  The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor.  Other beverage,  food and snack competitors include,  but are not limited to,  DPSG,  Kellogg Company,  Kraft Foods Group,  Inc.,  Mondelēz International,  Inc.,  Monster Beverage Corporation,  Nestlé S. A.,  Red Bull GmbH and Snyder is-Lance,  Inc.  Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry worldwide.  However,  The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.  Our beverage,  food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition,  taste,  pricequality,  product variety,  distribution,  advertising,  marketing and promotional activity,  packagingconvenience,  service and the ability to anticipate and respond to consumer trends.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products,  introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,  marketing programs,  product packaging,  pricing,  increased efficiency in production techniques,  new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketing,  coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network,  allows us to compete effectively.  See also 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors Our business,  financial condition or results of operations could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. "

Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth to drive innovation globally.  These activities principally involve production,  processing and packaging and include: development of new ingredients and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes; improvements in product quality,  safety and integrity; development of,  and improvements in,  packaging technology and dispensing equipment; and efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform,  grow and broaden our product portfolio,  including the development of sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers to reduce added sugarand recipes that allow us to reduce sodium levels in certain of our products.  Our research centers are located around the world,  including in Brazil,  China,  Germany,  India,  Mexico,  Russia,  the United Arab Emiratesthe United Kingdom and the United States,  and leverage nutrition science,  food science,  engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to develop nutritious,  convenient beverages,  foods and snacks.  In 2014,  we continued to refine our beverage,  food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer needs by developing a broader portfolio of product choices,  including building on our important nutrition platforms and brands Quaker (grains),  Tropicana (fruits and vegetables),  Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes) and Naked Juice (super-premium juice and protein smoothies) and expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories,  such as dairy,  hummus and other fresh dips,  and baked grain snacks.  We also made investments to minimize our impact on the environment,  including innovation in our packaging to make it increasingly sustainable,  and developed and implemented new technologies to enhance the quality and value of our current and future products,  as well as made investments to incorporate into our operations best practices and technology to support sustainable agriculture and to minimize our impact on the environment.  We continue to make investments to conserve energy and raw materials,  reduce waste in our facilities,  recycle containers,  use renewable resources and optimize package design to use fewer materials.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $718 million,  $665 million and $552 million in 2014,  2013 and 2012,  respectivelyand are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.

We have made,  and plan to continue making,  necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws.  While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations,  changes in environmental compliance requirements,  and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements,  could affect our financial performance.  In addition,  we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations in the normal course of business,  as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations,  including those of businesses acquired by our subsidiaries.

" The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA) requires disclosure of certain activities relating to Iran by PepsiCo or its affiliates that occurred during our 2014 fiscal year.  As previously disclosed,  one of our foreign subsidiaries historically maintained a small office in Iran,  which provided sales support to independent bottlers in Iran in connection with in-country sales of foreign-owned beverage brandsand which was not in contravention of any applicable U.S.  sanctions laws.  The office ceased all commercial activity since the enactment of ITRA.  In addition,  the office of the foreign subsidiary had one local bank account,  containing aggregate deposits of approximately $180,  with a bank identified on the list of 'Specially Designated Nationals" maintained by the U.S.  Treasury Department is Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  During our 2014 fiscal year,  our foreign subsidiary received a license from OFAC authorizing it to engage in activities related to the winding down of the office in Iran and to close the bank account.  Following receipt of this license,  our foreign subsidiary restarted the process of winding down its office and closed the bank account.  Subsequent to the end of 2014,  this license expired and the foreign subsidiary ceased the process of winding down its office upon expiration of the license.  The foreign subsidiary has applied for a license from OFAC to authorize continuation and completion of wind-down activities and intends to continue such activities upon receipt thereof.  The foreign subsidiary did not engage in any activities in Iran other than wind-down activities in 2014,  or have any revenues or profits attributable to activities in Iran during 2014.  10

In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,  you should carefully consider the following factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial conditionresults of operations or the price of our common stock.  The following information should be read together and in conjunction with 'Forward-Looking Statements, " 'Item 1.  Business, " 'Item 7.  Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, " our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto.  The risks below are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business,  financial condition,  results of operations or the price of our common stock.  Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate or market our products effectively and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and we rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits,  we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Our success depends on: our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends,  including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with health and wellness,  convenience and location of origin or source of the products they consume; our product quality; our ability to extend our portfolio of convenient beverages,  foods and snacks in growing markets; our ability to develop or acquire new products that are responsive to certain consumer preferences,  including reducing sodium,  added sugars and saturated fat; our ability to develop a broader portfolio of product choices and increase non-carbonated beverage offerings and alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings; 11 
Table of Contents 
our ability to develop sweetener innovation; our ability to improve the production and packaging of our products; and our ability to respond to competitive product and pricing pressures.  For example,  our growth rate may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or grow our current share of the liquid refreshment beverage market in North America,  or our current share of the snacks market globally,  or if demand for our products does not grow in developing and emerging markets.  In general,  changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may evolve due to a variety of factors,  including: the aging of the general population; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of certain of our products,  including their caloric content,  or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or substances present in certain of our products,  such as 4-MeI,  acrylamide,  artificial sweetenerscaffeine,  high-fructose corn syrup,  saturated fat,  sodium,  sugar,  trans fats or other product ingredientssubstances or attributes,  including genetically modified ingredients; packaging materials; changes in package or portion size; changes in in-home consumption patterns; changes in social trends that impact travel,  vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory action,  litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media,  including social media,  about us,  our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; consumer perception of social media posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees,  agents,  customers,  suppliers,  bottlers,  distributors,  joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of our employees,  agents,  customers,  suppliersbottlers,  distributors,  joint venture partners or other third parties or the business practices of such parties; a downturn in economic conditions; or taxes or other restrictions imposed on our products.  Any of these changes may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase our products.

Although we devote significant resources to the actions mentioned above,  there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop,  launch and maintain successful new products or variants of existing productsour ability to introduce new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner or our ability to correctly anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preference or develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to consumers.  Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands and may result in inventory write-offs and other costs that could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  The conduct of our businesses,  including the production,  storage,  distribution,  sale,  display,  advertisingmarketing,  labeling,  transportation and use of many of our products,  as well as our health and safety practicesare subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold.  Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold and,  in certain markets,  such as developing and emerging markets,  may be less developed or certain.  In addition,  these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change,  sometimes dramatically,  as a result of a variety of factors,  including political,  economic or social events.  Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling,  advertising and marketing practices; laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products; laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing,  restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in,  or attributes of,  certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products,  including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government programs,  such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of,  and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in,  or attributes of,  certain of our productsincluding without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; taxation requirements,  including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products; competition laws; anti-corruption laws; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating access to and use of water or utilities; and environmental laws,  including laws relating to the regulation of water rights,  treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions.  New laws,  regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations,  or changes in any of the foregoing,  including taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products,  ingredients or substances contained in,  or attributes of,  our products or commodities used in the production of our products,  may alter the environment in which we do business and,  therefore,  may increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products,  which could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold may also impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions,  other jurisdictions may follow and the requirements or restrictions,  or proposed requirements or restrictions,  may result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid).  For example,  if one jurisdiction imposes a specific labeling requirement or requires a specific warning on any product that contains certain ingredients or substances,  other jurisdictions may react and impose restrictions on products containing the same ingredients or substances,  which may result in adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of such ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid).  In addition,  studies are underway by third parties to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products,  such as 4-MeI,  acrylamide,  caffeine and sugar.  If consumer concerns,  whether or not valid,  about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances present in certain of our products increase as a result of these studies,  new scientific evidence,  new labeling,  product or production requirements or other restrictions,  or for any other reason,  including adverse publicity as a result of any of the foregoing,  or if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold,  demand for our products could decline,  or we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations 13

that could affect sales of our products,  any of which could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions,  as is compliance with anti-corruption laws.  In addition,  regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctions,  which could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance,  our employees,  suppliers,  or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions,  intentional or not,  that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations.  Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions,  including fines,  penalties,  disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions,  any of which could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In addition,  we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business,  as well as environmental remediation,  product liability,  toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations,  including those of businesses acquired by our subsidiaries.  Due to regulatory complexitiesuncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries,  the potential exists for remediation,  liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated.  We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold in more than 200 countries and territories.  As suchwe are subject to tax laws and regulations of various federal,  state and local governments in the United Statesas well as to tax laws and regulations outside the United States.  The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products,  ingredients or substances contained in our products or commodities used in the production of our products,  could increase the cost of our productsreduce overall consumption of our products,  lead to negative publicity (whether or not valid) or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs,  which could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  If one jurisdiction imposes new or increased taxes or limitations,  other jurisdictions may follow,  which may result in adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of our products (whether or not valid).  In addition,  we are subject to regular reviews,  examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the 14

United States.  Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operateor the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation,  may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals resulting in an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our net revenue and repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In addition,  key representatives of the U.S.  government have made public statements that tax reform is a priority and many countries outside the United States,  including countries in which we have significant operations,  are actively considering changes to existing tax laws.

Our beverage,  food and snack products are in highly competitive industries and markets and compete against products of international beverage,  food and snack companies that,  like us,  operate in multiple geographic areas,  as well as regional,  local and private label manufacturers and other competitors.  We compete with other large companies in each of the beverage,  food and snack categories,  including The Coca-Cola CompanyDPSG,  Kellogg Company,  Kraft Foods Group,  Inc.,  Mondelēz International,  Inc.,  Monster Beverage Corporation,  Nestlé S. A.,  Red Bull GmbH and Snyder is-Lance,  Inc.  In many countries in which our products are sold,  including the United States,  our primary beverage competitor is The Coca-Cola Company.  Our beverage,  food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition,  taste,  pricequality,  product variety,  distribution,  advertising,  marketing and promotional activity,  packagingconvenience,  service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer trends.  If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products,  if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective or if we are otherwise unable to compete effectively,  we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets,  which may adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Our business,  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets or as a result of unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are made,  manufactureddistributed or sold.  Our operations outside of the United States,  particularly in Russia,  Mexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil,  contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability,  and we believe that these countries and developing and emerging markets,  particularly China,  India and the Latin America,  Africa and Middle East regions,  present important future growth opportunities for us.  However,  there can be no assurance that our existing products,  variants of our existing products or new products that we make,  manufacture,  distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market,  due to local or global competition,  product price,  cultural differences,  consumer preferences or otherwise.  The following factors could reduce demand for our products,  or otherwise adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations: unstable economic,  political or social conditions,  acts of war,  terrorist acts,  and civil unrest in areas where our products are sold,  including Russia,  Ukraine,  Venezuela and the Middle East; increased competition; a slowdown in growth and the related impact on other countries who export to these markets; our inability to acquire businesses,  form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased sanctions against,  or other regulations restricting contact with,  countries in markets in which our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold,  such as Russia,  or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S.  multinational corporations operating in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries,  which,  from time to time,  result in significant cash balances in foreign countries,  such as Venezuela; regulations on the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary currency,  devaluation or fluctuation,  such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble,  Venezuelan bolivar,  Argentine peso,  Ukrainian hryvnia and Turkish lira; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; imposition of new or increased labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions; and increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,  including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,  the U.K.  Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act,  and adverse consequences,  such as the assessment of fines or penalties,  for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations.

An adverse change in any of the above factors could have a negative impact on the fair value of our intangible assets,  which could require us to record a non-cash impairment charge.  In addition,  we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our customers,  consumers,  suppliers,  bottlers,  distributors,  joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In addition,  some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions,  including U.S.  and non-U.S.  commercial banks,  insurance companies,  investment banks and other financial institutions,  may be exposed to a ratings downgrade,  bankruptcy,  liquidity,  default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions or other factors beyond our control.  A ratings downgrade,  bankruptcy,  receivershipdefault or similar event involving a major financial institution may limit the availability of credit or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all or,  with respect to financial institutions that are parties to our financing arrangements,  leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials,  or result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities,  which could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

" and 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " Our business,  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costsdisruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  We and our business partners use various raw materials and other supplies in our business.  The principal ingredients we use in our beverage,  food and snack products are apple,  orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates,  aspartame,  corn,  corn sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruit and other fruits,  oatsoranges,  potatoes,  raw milk,  rice,  seasonings,  sucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils,  and wheat.  We also use water in the manufacturing of our products.  Our key packaging materials include plastic resinsincluding PET and polypropylene resin used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles,  closures,  cardboard and paperboard cartons.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and in the trucks delivering our products.  Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest,  political instability or other unfavorable economic conditions,  and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak.  The raw materials and energy,  including fuel,  that we use for the manufacturing,  production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors,  including changes 17 
Table of Contents 
in global supply and demand,  weather conditions,  disease,  agricultural uncertainty,  governmental incentives and controls,  political uncertainties or governmental instability.  Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies,  sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Many of our ingredients,  raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market.  The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation,  and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,  pricing agreements and derivatives.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs,  we may not be able to increase our product prices or effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue,  margins and operating results.  In addition,  certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.  Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world.  The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to supply chain disruptionadverse effects on our operations or higher production costs that could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.  Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or global operating model could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to reduce costs and improve efficiencies.  Our productivity initiatives help fund our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations.  We are implementing strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage,  food and snack industries.  We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency,  decision making,  innovation and brand management across the global PepsiCo organization to enable us to compete effectively.  In order to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and our global operating model,  it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business,  which may be limited due to capital constraints.  In addition,  it is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plans.  If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiativesfail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate,  do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives,  or fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future,  our business,  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.  Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Our ability,  and that of our suppliers and other third parties,  including our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  joint venture partners,  independent distributors and retailers,  to make,  manufacture,  transportdistribute and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following could impair the ability to make,  manufacture,  transport,  distribute or sell our products: adverse weather conditions or natural disaster,  such as a hurricane,  earthquake or flooding; government 18

action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which our products are mademanufactured,  distributed or sold; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; health epidemics or pandemics; cybersecurity incidents; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occurcould adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our operations.  Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality,  safety and integrity could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Product contamination or tampering,  the failure to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers,  or allegations of product quality issues,  mislabeling,  misbranding,  spoilage,  allergens or contamination,  even if untrue,  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions,  which could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  If any of our products are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury,  illness or death,  or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements,  our products may be subject to a product recall and/or be subject to liability or government action,  which could result in payment of damages or fines,  cause certain of our products to be unavailable for a period of time or result in adverse publicity,  which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  We could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality,  safety and integrity generally.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  See also 'Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our businessfinancial condition or results of operations. " Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are a leading global beverage,  food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any of the following,  or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goal of continuing to refine our beverage,  food and snack choices to meet changing consumer demands by reducing sodium,  added sugars and saturated fat and developing a broader portfolio of product choices; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in,  or attributes of,  our products,  including whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale or advertising of our products; any failure to comply,  or perception of a failure to comply,  with our policies and goalsincluding those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugary drinks; our research and development efforts; our environmental impact,  including use of agricultural materialspackaging,  water,  energy use and waste management or any failure to achieve our goals with respect to minimizing our impact on the environment; the practices of our employees,  agents,  customers,  distributorssuppliers,  bottlers,  joint venture partners or other third parties with respect to any of the foregoing; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; or our responses to any of the foregoing or negative publicity as a result of any of the foregoing.  
Table of Contents 
In addition,  we operate globally,  which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations,  includingwithout limitation,  anti-corruption laws,  competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made,  manufactured,  distributed or sold.  In the event that our employees engage in improper activities,  we may be subject to enforcement actions,  litigation,  loss of sales or other consequenceswhich may cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation.  In addition,  water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to rise.  Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act,  or are perceived not to act,  responsibly with respect to water use.  Further,  the rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination.  As a result,  negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us,  our products,  policies,  practices or advertising campaigns and marketing programs,  our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees,  agents,  customers,  suppliersbottlers,  distributors,  joint venture partners or other third parties,  or consumer perception of any of the foregoing,  may also generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our businessfinancial condition or results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  See also 'Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate or market our products effectively and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operationsor to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisings,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions,  joint venturesdivestitures,  refranchisings and other strategic transactions.  Potential issues associated with these activities could include,  among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of an acquisition,  divestiture or refranchising,  or the formation of a joint venture,  within the anticipated time frame,  or at all; receipt of necessary consents,  clearances and approvals in connection with an acquisition,  joint venture,  divestiture or refranchising; and diversion of management is attention from day-to-day operations.  With respect to acquisitions,  the following also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company,  including integrating the manufacturing,  distributionsales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between us and the acquired company and our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating,  recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming standards,  controls (including internal control over financial reporting,  environmental compliance and health and safety compliance),  procedures and policiesbusiness cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; identifying and eliminating redundant and 20 
Table of Contents 
underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of the acquisitions; and other unanticipated problems and liabilities.  With respect to joint ventures,  we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals,  strategies,  priorities or resources as we do and joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners,  rather than for our exclusive benefit.  In additionacquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States,  including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws,  and laws and regulations outside the United States.  With respect to divestitures and refranchisings,  we may not be able to complete such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all.  Further,  as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business,  any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact sales or business performance.  If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations,  or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits we expect,  our business,  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.  If we are unable to hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce,  it could have a negative impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  We compete to hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions,  including the Chief Executive Officer,  or to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees,  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Any of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  The loss of any key customer or changes to the retail landscape could adversely affect our businessfinancial condition or results of operations.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  as well as other retailers,  to effectively compete.  The loss of any of our key customers could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In addition,  our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape,  including increased consolidation of retail ownership,  particularly in North America and Europe,  resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing power,  which may impact our ability to compete in these areas.  Such retailers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks,  other distribution channels such as e-commerce,  or private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to market systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to any such actions or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  In addition,  if we are unable to resolve a dispute with any of our key customers,  or if there is a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers,  even if unrelated to us,  our business,  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.  We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access which we believe will ensure appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency,  especially any downgrade to below investment grade,  whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control,  could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  Further,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,  and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade.  See also 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " and 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained in 'Item 7.  Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. " Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against,  or effectively respond to,  cybersecurity incidents or if our information systems are otherwise disrupted.  We depend on information technology,  including public websites and cloud-based services,  for many activities important to our business,  including to interface with our customers and consumers,  to engage in digital marketing activities,  to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations,  to order and manage materials from suppliers,  to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency,  to comply with regulatory,  financial reportinglegal and tax requirements,  to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information,  and to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  joint ventures,  suppliers and other third parties.  As with other large and prominent companies,  we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and such attempts are occurring more frequently,  are constantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain our information technology infrastructureif we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cybersecurity incidents,  or if our information systems are damaged,  destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters,  fires,  power outages,  acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events,  network outages,  software,  equipment or telecommunications failuresuser errors,  or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software,  denial of service attacksmalicious social engineering,  hackers or otherwise),  our business could be disrupted and we could,  among other things,  be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of,  or failure to attract newcustomers and consumers; the loss of revenues from unauthorized use,  acquisition or disclosure of or access to confidential information; the loss of or damage to intellectual property or trade secrets,  including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data,  confidential information or other assets; damage to our reputation; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions; violation of data privacy,  security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs.  Further,  our information systems and the information stored therein,  could be compromised by,  and we could experience similar adverse consequences due to,  unauthorized outside parties intent on accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information,  corrupting information or disrupting business processes or by inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or agents.  Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions,  including payroll processing,  health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions.  See also 'Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively,  our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.  We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to share certain information technology support services and administrative functions,  including payroll processing,  health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions,  and may enter into agreements to share services for other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  In addition,  we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process,  transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees,  customers,  consumers and other third parties.  If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively,  or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance,  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers and our reputation could be harmed.  Depending on the function involved,  such errors may also lead to business disruptionprocessing inefficiencies,  the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breach or otherwise,  litigation or remediation costs,  or damage to our reputation and could have a negative impact on employee morale.  See also 'Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " and 'Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against,  or effectively respond to,  cybersecurity incidents or if our information systems are otherwise disrupted. " We have also embarked on a multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systemsincluding our financial processing systems,  to enterprise-wide systems solutions.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure,  or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative,  it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers or consumers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the applications on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We hold assets and incur liabilities,  earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.  dollars,  the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States,  where the functional currency is other than the U.S.  dollar,  are translated into U.S.  dollars.  Our operations outside of the United States,  particularly in RussiaMexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil,  generate a significant portion of our net revenue.  In additionwe purchase many of the ingredients,  raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous currencies.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  See also 'Market Risks" contained in 'Item 7.  Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.  Climate change,  or legal,  regulatory or market measures to address climate change,  may negatively affect our business and operations.  There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures,  weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity,  we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products,  such as sugar cane,  corn,  wheat,  rice,  oats,  potatoes and various fruits.  As a result of climate 23 
Table of Contents 
change,  we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water,  deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water,  which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.  In addition,  natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.  The increasing concern over climate change also may result in new or increased regional,  federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases.  In the event that such regulation is more aggressive than the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency,  we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment.  In particularincreasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energy,  including fuel,  required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products,  thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result,  the effects of climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.  See also 'Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate or market our products effectively and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

" and 'Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " A portion of our workforce belongs to unions.  Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements,  or strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer.  Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms,  which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales,  which could adversely impact our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  The terms and conditions of existing,  renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy.  Our intellectual property rights could be infringed or challenged and reduce the value of our products and brands and have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business.  These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrights,  patents,  business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products,  their packaging,  the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses.  We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark,  copyright,  patent and trade secret laws,  third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property.  If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrightspatents,  business processes and other trade secrets,  or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property,  the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation or legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business,  including but not limited to litigation related to our advertising,  marketing or commercial practicesproduct labels,  claims and ingredients,  and environmental,  employment and insurance matters.  Since litigation is inherently uncertain,  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings,  or that management is assessment of the materiality of these matters,  including the reserves taken in connection therewith,  will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings.  In the event that management is assessment of materiality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future,  there may be a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.

As we look to 2015 and beyond,  we remain focused on positioning our Company for long-term sustainable growth while continuing to deliver strong financial results.  Our business strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our Company,  including: uncertain macroeconomic conditions,  including geopoliticaleconomic and social instability; evolving consumer tastes and preferences,  including continued consumer focus on nutritious products and changes in customer channels,  including the growth of e-commerce; and resource scarcity.  See also 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors" for additional information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.  We believe that many of these challenges create new growth opportunities for our Company.  For example,  we believe that continued consumer focus on health and wellness and changes in consumer and distribution channels will provide us with new opportunities to expand our product offerings and interact with our customers and consumers.  In order to address these challenges and capitalize on these opportunities,  we intend to do the following: Strengthen our presence around the world.  Continued global expansion will be critical to our continued growth.  The global middle class is growing rapidly.  With three billion people projected to join the middle class in growth markets in the next 20 yearswe believe we have the opportunity to continue to expand our business around the world.  Although this presents growth opportunities in the long-term,  the global economic landscape remains volatile,  with many of the markets in which our products are sold continuing to experience unstable economic,  political and social conditions.  To address these challenges,  we plan to continue building a portfolio that is balanced across geographies and categories to help navigate short-term volatility and uncertainty in these markets.  Continue to broaden the range of our product portfolio,  including expanding our offerings of more nutritious products.  We anticipate that the consumer demand for convenient,  functional nutrition,  fruits,  vegetables,  protein and value-added dairy,  local and natural ingredients,  and better-for-you snacking and beverage options will continue to grow as consumer tastes and preferences continue to evolve.  To meet this growing demand,  we plan to continue to grow our portfolio of more nutritious products as well as to reduce added sugar,  sodium and saturated fat in certain key brands,  while continuing to focus on the great taste consumers expect from our beverages,  foods and snacks.  At the end of 2014,  approximately 20% of our net revenue came from our nutrition businesses.  We expect that our increased investments in global research and development will enable us to continue to meet the growing demand for convenient,  nutritious products and a broad variety of snack and beverage options.  Continue to adapt to changing customer channels.  Digital technology continues to change the retail landscape and the way in which we interact with retailersshoppers and consumers.  As part of this shift,  e-commerce is emerging as a significant factor.  To help retailers navigate this changing landscape,  and to build relationships with consumers through emerging channels,  we plan on increasing our e-commerce presence,  developing tailored customer strategies and utilizing the size and scale of our distribution system.  Continue to focus on productivity.  We also intend to focus on productivity and lowering the cost base of the Company over the long term andby utilizing our global scale,  eliminating duplication,  deploying new technologies and capitalizing on everyday opportunities to lower our cost base.  We achieved our targeted productivity savings of $1 billion for 2014 and have successfully completed the three-year,  $3 billion productivity program we launched in 2012.  We are focused on our five-year,  $5 billion productivity program,  which we expect will extend annual savings of $1 billion from 2015 through 2019.  This next generation of productivity initiatives will focus on the following areas: increasing automation in our operations to reduce costs and increase capacity; expanding shared services,  restructuring our manufacturing operations to optimize our assets and capabilities globally; 37 
Table of Contents 
restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network; and increasing organizational effectiveness and efficiencies through the ongoing evolution of our operating model.  Continue to embrace sustainable business practices across our supply chain.  We expect the demand for finite natural resources will continue to rise as the global population continues to grow.  To address this concern,  we plan to continue developing and deploying innovative ways to conserve and replenish water,  reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions,  promote sustainable agriculture and decrease waste sent to landfills.  Build and retain top talent.  We expect that the global competition for talent will continue to accelerate.  Global companies like PepsiCo need strong general managers in local markets,  leaders who can collaborate effectively on multi-disciplinary teams and employees who can solve complex,  multi-faceted challenges.  To meet the future needs of our business,  we remain focused on systematically developing the functional,  technical and leadership skills we need for sustainable long-term performance.  Deliver on the promise of Performance with Purpose.  Performance with Purpose is our goal to deliver top-tier financial performance while creating sustainable growth and shareholder value.  In practice,  Performance with Purpose means providing a wide range of beverages,  foods and snacks,  from treats to healthy eats; finding innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment and reduce our operating costs; providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our employees globally; and respecting,  supporting and investing in the local communities in which we operate.  PepsiCo was again recognized for its leadership in this area in 2014 by earning a place on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the eighth consecutive year and on the North America Index for the ninth consecutive year.  Our Operations We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions),  as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA); 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA); 3) Latin America Foods (LAF),  which includes all of our food and snack businesses in Latin America; 4) PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB),  which includes all of our North American and Latin American beverage businesses; 5) PepsiCo Europe (Europe),  which includes all beverage,  food and snack businesses in Europe and South Africa; and 6) PepsiCo Asia,  Middle East and Africa (AMEA),  which includes all beverage,  food and snack businesses in AMEA,  excluding South Africa.

Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:  commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; 
 foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and 
interest rates.  
In the normal course of business,  we manage commodity price,  foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful costsaving opportunities or efficiencies,  including the use of derivatives.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  See 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " and 'Our business,  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs,  disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials or other supplies. " in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.  The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  See 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A.  for further discussion.  Commodity Prices Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $12 billion as of December 27,  2014 and $14 billion as of December 28,  2013.  At the end of 2014,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2014 by $103 million.  Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 49% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 23% of our net revenue in 2014.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in certain of the international markets in which we operate.  In addition,  unstable economic,  political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are soldincluding in Russia,  Ukraine and the Middle East,  and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets,  as well as Venezuela (discussed below),  Argentina and Turkey continue to result in challenging operating environments.  During 2014,  unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points,  primarily due to depreciation of the Russian ruble,  Canadian dollar,  Venezuelan bolivarArgentine peso and Mexican peso.  Currency declines against the U.S.  dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  The results of our Venezuelan businesses have been reported under highly inflationary accounting since the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  at which time the functional currency of our Venezuelan entities was changed from the bolivar to the U.S.  dollar.  In February 2013,  the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the exchange rate of government-operated National Center of Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX) ('fixed exchange rate"),  formerly 40 
Table of Contents 
the Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI),  from 43 bolivars per U.S.  dollar to 63 bolivars per U.S.  dollar,  resulting in an after-tax net charge of $111 million in the first quarter of 2013 (see 'Items Affecting Comparability").  In January 2014,  the Venezuelan government announced the expansion of its auction-based foreign exchange system (SICAD 1) to include additional items,  including foreign investments.  In March 2014,  the Venezuelan government introduced an additional auction-based foreign exchange system (SICAD 2) which permitted all companies incorporated or domiciled in Venezuela to bid for U.S.  dollars for any purpose.  As a result,  as of December 27,  2014,  there was a three-tiered exchange rate mechanism in Venezuelaand the SICAD 1 rate was 12 bolivars per U.S.  dollar and the SICAD 2 rate was 50 bolivars per U.S.  dollar.  On February 11,  2015,  the Venezuelan government announced that the transactions for the sale or purchase of foreign currency under the SICAD 2 exchange system would no longer be available and created a new open market foreign exchange system (SIMADI).  At December 27,  2014,  we had pending requests with an agency of the Venezuelan government for remittance of dividends of approximately $310 million at the fixed exchange rate.  These requests pertain to the years from 2006 to 2012.  We are unable to predict the likelihood of Venezuelan government approvals of these requests or any requests that we may file in the future or,  if any such requests are approved,  the estimated time for remittance.  At the end of each period,  we remeasure the net monetary assets of our Venezuela entities at the rate at which we expect them to be settled,  including the payment of dividends.  During the fourth quarter of 2014,  certain of our pending dividend requests at the fixed exchange rate were denied by CENCOEX.  We analyzed the exchange rates available to our Venezuela entities,  including for payment of future dividend requests.  As a result of this analysis,  we believe that,  except as noted below,  the SICAD 1 exchange rate is the most appropriate rate to remeasure our net monetary assets.  Therefore,  during the fourth quarter of 2014,  we incurred an after-tax net charge of $105 million to remeasure certain of the net monetary assets of our Venezuela entities at the SICAD 1 rate (see 'Items Affecting Comparability").  We remeasure certain other net monetary assets at the fixed exchange rate,  since we believe that dividends submitted to CENCOEX in prior years at the fixed exchange rate and payables for imports of essential goods approved by CENCOEX continue to qualify for settlement at the fixed exchange rate.  In 2014,  our results of operations in Venezuela generated 2% of our net revenue and 4% of our operating profit.  As of December 27,  2014,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 9% of our cash and cash equivalents balance.  Our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets in Venezuela,  which primarily include cash and cash equivalents,  approximated $480 million at December 27,  2014.  Our non-monetary assets in Venezuela,  which primarily include equity investments,  intangible assets,  property,  plant and equipment and inventoryapproximated $650 million at December 27,  2014.  We continue to evaluate available options to obtain U.S.  dollars to meet our operational needs in Venezuela.  We believe that significant uncertainty exists regarding the exchange mechanisms in Venezuela,  including the nature of transactions that are eligible to flow through CENCOEX,  SICAD 1 or SIMADI,  or any other new exchange mechanism that may emerge (whether as a result of the Venezuelan government is announcement on February 11,  2015 or otherwise),  as well as how any such mechanisms will operate in the future and the availability of U.S.  dollars under each mechanism.  We continue to monitor developments closely and may determine in the future that rates other than the SICAD 1 rate or the fixed exchange rateas applicable,  are appropriate for remeasurement of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan entities.  If,  at December 27,  2014,  we had used the SICAD 1 rate to remeasure the net monetary assets that remain at the fixed exchange rate,  we would have incurred an additional net charge of approximately $160 million.  If,  at December 27,  2014,  we had remeasured all net monetary assets of our Venezuela businesses at 50 bolivars per U.S.  dollar (which was the SICAD 2 rate at December 27,  2014),  we would have incurred an additional net charge of approximately $400 million.  Any such remeasurement charge,  if recognized,  would be reflected 41 
Table of Contents 
in 'Items Affecting Comparability. " Any further devaluation of the bolivar,  change in the currency exchange mechanisms or fluctuation of the SICAD 1 auction-based rate,  which may vary throughout the year,  could adversely affect our financial position,  including a potential impairment of non-monetary assets,  and results of operations,  both for any period in which we determine to remeasure using another rate and on a going forward basis following any such remeasurement.  In 2014,  the Venezuelan government also issued a new Law on Fair Pricing,  establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%.  The new law did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial position.  During 2014,  Russia announced economic sanctions against the United States and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain ingredients and finished goods from specific countries.  We do not anticipate the current sanctions to have a material impact on the results of our operations in Russia or our consolidated results or financial position,  and we will continue to monitor the economic,  operating and political environment in Russia closely.  For both years ending December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013,  7% of our total net revenue was generated by our operations in Russia.  As of December 27,  2014,  our long-lived assets in Russia were $45 billion.  Our operations in Ukraine are not significant in relation to our consolidated results or financial position.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $27 billion as of December 27,  2014 and $25 billion as of December 28,  2013.  At the end of 2014,  we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains by $141 million.  Interest Rates The notional values of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013 were $93 billion and $79 billion,  respectively.  Assuming year-end 2014 investment levels and variable rate debt,  a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased net interest expense by $17 million in 2014 due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results.  These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  Our critical accounting policies are: 
 revenue recognition; 
goodwill and other intangible assets; 
income tax expense and accruals; and 
pension and retiree medical plans.  
Table of Contents 
Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally,  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-ofdate products.  Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In addition,  DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  we monitor customer inventory levels.  As discussed in 'Our Customers" in 'Item 1.  Business. ",  we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentivesdiscounts,  advertising and other marketing activities.  Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $358 billion in 2014 and $347 billion in both 2013 and 2012.  Sales incentives and discounts include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targets,  and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  In addition,  certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  Certain arrangementssuch as fountain pouring rights,  may extend beyond one year.  Payments made to obtain these rights are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  primarily as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $355 million as of December 27,  2014 and $410 million as of December 28,  2013 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For interim reporting,  our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs.  The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period is actual gross revenue or volume,  as applicable,  to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume,  as applicable.  Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period,  any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified.  In addition,  we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities.  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our total marketplace spending.  Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.  43

We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,  the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions.  In a business combination,  the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilitiesincluding brands and other intangible assets,  based on estimated fair values,  with any excess recorded as goodwill.  Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  such as marketplace participants,  product life cycles,  market share,  consumer awarenessbrand history and future expansion expectations,  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful lives,  which generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history,  future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions,  as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  In connection with previous acquisitions,  we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.  In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,  many factors were considered,  including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements,  the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows,  as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to usincluding legal,  regulatory,  contractual,  competitive,  economic or other factors.  Therefore,  certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived,  with the balance amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually,  using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter.  Where we use the qualitative assessment,  first we determine if,  based on qualitative factors,  it is more likely than not that an impairment exists.  Factors considered include macroeconomic,  industry and competitive conditions,  legal and regulatory environment,  historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit.  If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists,  then a quantitative assessment is performed.  The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management is strategic business plans,  annual sales growth rates and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time.  Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operatingmacroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales,  operating profit or cash flows.  All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets,  such as forecasted growth rates and weighted average cost of capital,  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A,  and 'Our Business Risks. " 
Table of Contents 
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on performing the quantitative assessment.  Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairmentthe asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on its discounted future cash flows or another income-based approach.  We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 272014,  December 28,  2013 and December 29,  2012.  In 2014,  we performed the impairment analysis for goodwill for all our reporting units using the qualitative approach and concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts.  After reaching this conclusion,  no further testing was performed.  In 2014 and 2012,  we recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Europe for nonamortizable intangible assets of $23 million in each year.  We recognized no impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in 2013.  As of December 27,  2014,  the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PAB exceeded their carrying values.  However,  there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PAB is reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PAB is CSD business do not achieve our expected estimated future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.  We have also analyzed the impact of the recent economic and political developments in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 27,  2014.  However,  a further deterioration in these conditions in Russia could potentially require us to record an impairment charge for these assets in the future.  Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  See 'Imposition of new taxes,  disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A.  An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our 45 
Table of Contents 
financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  In 2014,  our annual tax rate was 251% compared to 237% in 2013,  as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate increased 14 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily due to lapping the prior year impact of the favorable resolution with the IRS of audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009 partially offset by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the current year.  Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  Certain U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost.  In addition,  the Company has been phasing out certain Company subsidies of retiree medical benefits.  In the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2012,  the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S.  defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant is pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA) ).  In 2014,  we recorded a pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $141 million ($88 million after-tax or $006 per share).  In 2012we recorded a pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $195 million ($131 million after-tax or $008 per share).  See 'Items Affecting Comparability" and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working,  as well as the present value of those benefits.  Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost),  (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost),  and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements,  reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.  Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: 
 the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 
certain employee-related demographic factors,  such as turnover,  retirement age and mortality; 
the expected return on assets in our funded plans; 
for pension expense,  the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and 
for retiree medical expense,  health care cost trend rates.  
Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management is best judgment regarding future expectations.  Due to the significant management judgment involved,  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expenses and obligations.  At each measurement date,  the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality,  long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities.  Our 2012 U.S.  pension and retiree medical expense was based on the discount rate determined using the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (Mercer Curve).  The Mercer Curve used a portfolio of high-quality bonds rated Aa or higher by Moody is.  46 
Table of Contents 
In 2012,  due to the downgrade of several global financial institutions by Moody is,  Mercer developed a new curve,  the Above Mean Curve,  which we used to determine the discount rate for our U.S.  pension and retiree medical plans as of year-end 2012 and going forward.  These curves include bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflect the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.  We review our employee demographic assumptions annually and update the assumptions as necessary.  During 2014,  we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries,  adjusted to reflect our experience and future expectations.  This resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of our U.S.  pension and retiree medical programs.  We also reviewed and revised other demographic assumptions to reflect recent experience.  The net effect of these changes and certain plan design changes resulted in an increase of approximately $150 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 27,  2014.  See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected return on plan assets and our plan investment strategy.  The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan is liability and expense is reviewed annually.  Our review is based on our claim experience,  information provided by our health plans and actuariesand our knowledge of the health care industry.  Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics,  plan design,  new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.  Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: Pension Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Expected rate of salary increases Retiree medical Expense discount rate Expected rate of return on plan assets Current health care cost trend rate 
Based on our assumptions,  we expect our pension and retiree medical expenses to decrease in 2015 primarily driven by favorable experience,  updates to demographic assumptions and plan changes,  offset by lower discount rates and updates to our mortality assumptions.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  A 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would increase the 2015 pension expense as follows: Assumption Discount rate Expected rate of return 
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  
Table of Contents 
Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis,  although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.  Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors,  such as changes in interest rates,  deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws.  See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  energy and metals.  Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,  general and administrative expenses,  depending on the underlying commodity.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2014,  we recognized $68 million ($44 million after-tax or $003 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses,  with a $33 million net gain recognized in cost of sales and a $101 million net loss recognized in selling,  general and administrative expenses.

See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.  Non-GAAP Measures Certain measures contained in this Form 10-K are financial measures that are adjusted for items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability" for a detailed list and description of each of these items)as well as,  in certain instances,  adjusted for foreign exchange.  These measures are not in accordance with U.S.  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Items adjusted for currency assume foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period.  In order to compute our constant currency results,  we multiply or divide,  as appropriate,  our current year U.S.  dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,  as appropriate,  those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are indicative of our ongoing performance 51 
Table of Contents 
and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP reporting measures.  See also 'Organic Revenue Growth" and 'Free Cash Flow. " Results of Operations — Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below,  'effective net pricing" reflects the year-overyear impact of discrete pricing actions,  sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and  net pricing" reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes,  weight changes per package,  discounts and allowances.  Additionally'acquisitions and divestitures, " except as otherwise noted,  reflect all mergers and acquisitions activityincluding the impact of acquisitions,  divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.  Volume Our beverage volume in the PAB,  Europe and AMEA segments reflects sales to authorized bottlersindependent distributors and retailers,  as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks that have been sold through our authorized independent bottlers.  Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality,  timing of product launches,  product mix,  bottler inventory practices and other factors.  While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume,  as there are independent bottlers in the supply chain,  we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer level.  Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume.  PAB,  AMEA and Europe,  either independently or in conjunction with third parties,  make,  marketdistribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name),  and PAB further,  either independently or in conjunction with third parties,  makes,  markets,  distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks.  In addition,  AMEA licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi.  Our food and snacks volume in the FLNA,  QFNA,  LAF,  Europe and AMEA segments is reported on a systemwide basis,  which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks.  Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e.,  kilos,  gallons,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  In 2014,  total servings increased 1% compared to 2013.  In 2013,  total servings increased 2% compared to 2012.  Servings growth in 2013 reflects an adjustment to the base year for divestitures and business changes.

2014 On a reported basis,  total operating profit decreased 1% and operating margin decreased 02 percentage points.  Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases including strategic initiatives related to capacity and capability,  higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.  Commodity inflation negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage pointsprimarily attributable to inflation in the LAF and Europe segments,  partially offset by deflation in the PAB and FLNA segments.  These impacts were partially offset by favorable effective net pricing and the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives,  which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories throughout all of our segments.  Additionally,  the impact of certain charges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans negatively impacted operating profit performance by nearly 1 percentage point,  primarily in the Europe and AMEA segments.  Other corporate unallocated expenses decreased 8%,  primarily reflecting decreased pension expense,  as well as the lapping of incremental investments into our business in the prior year,  partially offset by higher foreign exchange transaction losses.  Items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") negatively impacted total operating profit performance by 38 percentage points and total operating margin by 06 percentage points.  2013 On a reported basis,  total operating profit increased 7% and operating margin increased 07 percentage points.  Operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories,  partially offset by certain operating cost increases including strategic initiatives related to capacity and capability,  higher advertising and marketing expenses and higher commodity costs.  Commodity inflation reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points,  primarily attributable to inflation in the Europe,  LAF and AMEA segments,  partially offset by deflation in the PAB and FLNA segments.  Operating profit also benefited from actions associated with our productivity initiatives,  which 53

Operating profit declined 11%,  reflecting operating cost increases including strategic initiatives as well as the impact of lapping the prior year refranchising of our Vietnam beverage business,  which negatively impacted operating performance by 12 percentage points and primarily reflected a one-time gain of $137 million.  These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories.  The lapping of incremental investments into our business in the prior yearwhich positively contributed 45 percentage points to operating profit performance,  was partially offset by certain charges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans,  which negatively impacted operating performance by 25 percentage points.  See Note 3 for additional information on 'Other Productivity Initiatives. " 2013 Net revenue declined 2%,  reflecting the impact of the prior year transaction with Tingyi and the Vietnam beverage refranchising,  which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 55 percentage points and 4 percentage points,  respectively.  The prior year deconsolidation of International Dairy and Juice Limited (IDJ) had a slight negative impact on net revenue performance.  These impacts were offset by favorable effective net pricing and volume growth.  Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net revenue performance by 4 percentage points.  Snacks volume grew 7%,  reflecting double-digit growth in China and high-single-digit growth in Thailand and the Middle East,  partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Australia.  Additionally,  India experienced mid-single-digit growth.  Beverage volume grew 12%,  driven by double-digit growth in China (including the co-branded juice products distributed through our strategic alliance with Tingyi) and Pakistan,  partially offset by a double-digit decline in Thailand.  Additionally,  the Middle East experienced low-single-digit growth and India experienced slight growth.  Operating profit grew 57%,  reflecting the impact of lapping restructuring and other charges related to the prior year transaction with Tingyi included in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") and a one-time gain of $137 million associated with the Vietnam beverage refranchising (which contributed 18 percentage points to reported operating profit growth).  Excluding items affecting comparability,  operating profit grew 30%,  reflecting the one-time gain associated with the Vietnam beverage refranchising (which contributed 15 percentage points to operating profit growth excluding items affecting comparability).  Operating profit performance also reflected the effective net pricing,  volume growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories,  partially offset by certain operating cost increases reflecting strategic initiatives,  higher advertising and marketing expenses,  as well as higher commodity costs,  which reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points.  The impact of incremental investments in our business reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points.  Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition,  together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing,  such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing,  will be adequate to meet our operating,  investing and financing needs.  Our primary sources of cash available to us to fund cash outflows,  such as our anticipated share repurchases,  dividend payments and scheduled debt maturities,  include cash from operations and proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt.  However,  there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital 63

and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities.  See also 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition or results of operations. " in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A.  As of December 27,  2014,  we had cash,  cash equivalents and short-term investments of $74 billion outside the U.S.  In the fourth quarter of 2014,  we remitted $6 billion of international cash to the United States through a return of basis,  which was used to repay commercial paper borrowings.  As a return of basis,  there was no impact on our international earnings and the impact on our provision for income taxes was insignificant.  To the extent foreign earnings are repatriated,  such amounts would be subject to income tax liabilities,  both in the U.S.  and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions.  In addition,  currency restrictions enacted by the government in Venezuela have impacted our ability to pay dividends outside of the country from our snack and beverage operations in Venezuela.  As of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 9% and 5%,  respectively,  of our cash and cash equivalents balance.  For additional information on the impact of our remeasurement,  see 'Market Risks Foreign Exchange" in 'Our Business Risks" and 'Items Affecting Comparability. " Furthermore,  our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.  On a continuing basis,  we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results,  including acquisitionsdivestitures,  joint ventures,  share repurchases,  productivity and other efficiency initiatives,  and other structural changes.  These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.  The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2013 2012 2014 $ 10506 $ 9688 $ 8479 $ (4937) $ (2625) $ (3005) $ (8264) $ (3789) $ (3306) 
Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used for investing activities Net cash used for financing activities Operating Activities 
During 2014,  net cash provided by operating activities was $105 billion,  compared to $97 billion in the prior year.  The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects lapping the impact of the prior year U.S.  federal net cash tax payments of $758 million,  including interest,  related to an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009 and $226 million of cash payments for other federal,  state and local tax matters related to open tax years.  See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.  This impact was partially offset by discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions,  pertaining to the lump sum payments,  in the United States of $388 million ($261 million aftertax) in 2014.  During 2013,  net cash provided by operating activities was $97 billion,  compared to $85 billion in the prior year.  The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects the overlap of discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions of $15 billion ($11 billion after-tax) made in 2012,  higher restructuring and cash payments related to the transaction with Tingyi in 2012 and favorable working capital comparisons to 2012.  These impacts were partially offset by the tax payments described above.  Also see 'Free Cash Flow" below for certain other items impacting net cash provided by operating activities.  
Table of Contents 
Investing Activities During 2014,  net cash used for investing activities was $49 billion,  primarily reflecting net capital spending of $27 billion and net purchases of marketable debt securities of $24 billion.  See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our marketable debt securities.  During 2013,  net cash used for investing activities was $26 billion,  primarily reflecting $27 billion for net capital spending.  We expect 2015 net capital spending to be approximately $3 billion,  within our long-term capital spending target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.  Financing Activities During 2014,  net cash used for financing activities was $83 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $87 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $20 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $17 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $08 billion.  During 2013,  net cash used for financing activities was $38 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $64 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $12 billion,  proceeds from exercises of stock options of $11 billion and net proceeds from long-term debt of $03 billion.  We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors,  including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  On February 11,  2015,  we announced a new share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $120 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing from July 1,  2015 and expiring on June 30,  2018.  This repurchase program is in addition to the current $100 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors and publicly announced in the first quarter of 2013,  which commenced on July 1,  2013 and expires on June 30,  2016.  On February 11,  2015,  we also announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $281 per share from $262 per share,  effective with the dividend that is expected to be paid in June 2015.  We expect to return a total of $85 billion to $90 billion to shareholders in 2015 through share repurchases of approximately $45 billion to $50 billion and dividends of approximately $40 billion.  Free Cash Flow We focus on free cash flow as an important element in evaluating our performance.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  Additionally,  we consider certain items (included in the table below) in evaluating free cash flow.  We believe investors should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow results.  Free cash flow excluding certain items is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not measures provided by U.S.  GAAP.  Therefore,  these measures are not,  and should not be viewed assubstitutes for U.S.  GAAP cash flow measures.

In all years presented,  free cash flow was used primarily to pay dividends and repurchase shares.  We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access,  which we believe will ensure appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates.  However,  see 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A.  and 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency,  especially any downgrade to below investment grade,  whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control,  could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  In addition,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,  and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  See 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Risk Factors" in Item 1A,  'Our Business Risks" and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  Additionally,  we do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing or disclosing assets or liabilities.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.  GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In addition,  we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interestour ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  The results of our Venezuelan businesses have been reported under highly inflationary accounting since the beginning of 2010.  See further unaudited information in 'Our Business Risks, " 'Items Affecting Comparability" and 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilities,  are included in cost of sales.  The costs of moving,  storing and delivering finished product are included in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  tax reservesstock-based compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  amounts and useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands,  goodwill and other long-lived assets.  We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience,  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances,  such as current economic conditions,  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change.  As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  While our United States and Canada (North America) results are reported on a weekly calendar basis,  most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis.  The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for all reporting periods presented: Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter

Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless noted,  and are based on unrounded amounts.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the current year presentation.  Our Divisions Through our operations,  authorized bottlers,  contract manufacturers and other third parties,  we make,  marketsell and distribute a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable foods and beverages,  serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in North America,  RussiaMexico,  the United Kingdom and Brazil.  Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions.  For additional unaudited information on our divisions,  see 'Our Operations" contained in 'Item 1.  Business. " The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for the following allocation methodologies: 
 stock-based compensation expense; pension and retiree medical expense; and derivatives.  
Stock-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2014 was approximately 15% to FLNA,  2% to QFNA,  6% to LAF,  24% to PAB13% to Europe,  10% to AMEA and 30% to corporate unallocated expenses.  We had similar allocations of stock-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2013 and 2012.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at a fixed discount rate,  as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension plan amendments and gains and losses due to demographics (including mortality assumptions and salary experience) are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate,  for retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension plans,  pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding,  and gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  In addition,  corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  energy and metals.  Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses,  as either cost of sales or selling,  general and administrative expenses,  depending on the underlying commodity.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.  74

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our customers,  including Wal-Mart.  In 2014,  sales to Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 12% of our total net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers,  which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives,  discounts,  advertising and other marketing activities.  Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $358 billion in 2014 and $347 billion in both 2013 and 2012.  Sales incentives and discounts include payments to customers 77 
Table of Contents 
for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  It also includes support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rights,  may extend beyond one year.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  primarily as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $355 million as of December 27,  2014 and $410 million as of December 28,  2013 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Advertising and other marketing activities,  reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses,  totaled $39 billion in 2014 and 2013 and $37 billion in 2012,  including advertising expenses of $23 billion in 2014,  $24 billion in 2013 and $22 billion in 2012.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: 
 media and personal service prepayments; promotional materials in inventory; and production costs of future media advertising.  
Deferred advertising costs of $42 million and $68 million as of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $97 billion in 2014,  $94 billion in 2013 and $91 billion in 2012.  Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software(ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which approximate 5 to 10 years.  Software amortization totaled $208 million in 2014,  $197 million in 2013 and $196 million in 2012.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $09 billion and $11 billion as of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013,  respectively.  Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  certain taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  78

Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth to drive innovation globally.  These activities principally involve production,  processing and packaging and include: development of new ingredients and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes; improvements in product quality,  safety and integrity; development of,  and improvements in,  packaging technology and dispensing equipment; and efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform,  grow and broaden our product portfolio,  including the development of sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers to reduce added sugarand recipes that allow us to reduce sodium levels in certain of our products.  We also made investments to minimize our impact on the environment,  including innovation in our packaging to make it increasingly sustainable,  and developed and implemented new technologies to enhance the quality and value of our current and future products,  as well as made investments to incorporate into our operations best practices and technology to support sustainable agriculture and to minimize our impact on the environment.  We continue to make investments to conserve energy and raw materials,  reduce waste in our facilities,  recycle containersuse renewable resources and optimize package design to use fewer materials.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $718 million,  $665 million and $552 million in 2014,  2013 and 2012,  respectively,  and are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually,  using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter.  Where we use the qualitative assessment,  first we determine if,  based on qualitative factors,  it is more likely than not that an impairment exists.  Factors considered include macroeconomic,  industry and competitive conditions,  legal and regulatory environment,  historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit.  If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists,  then a quantitative assessment is performed.  The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management is strategic business plans,  annual sales growth rates and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time.  In the quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets,  if the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows or another income-based approach,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Quantitative assessment of goodwill is performed using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the carrying value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its estimated fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record,  if any.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Quantitative assessments described above are primarily based on expected future levels of sales and operating profit which are inputs from our annual long-range planning process that are used to estimate future cash flows.  Additionally,  they are also impacted by estimates of discount ratesperpetuity growth assumptions and other factors.  Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating,  macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of salesoperating profit or cash flows.  All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for nonamortizable intangible assets,  such as forecasted growth rates and weighted average cost of capital,  are based on the best 79 
Table of Contents 
available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairmentthe asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on its discounted future cash flows or another income-based approach.

Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2014,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period.  The guidance requires that a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition that affects the vesting of the award rather than factored into the grant date fair value.  The guidance is effective as of the beginning of our 2016 fiscal year and can be applied prospectively to all share-based payments granted or modified on or after the effective date with early adoption permissible.  This guidance is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements.  In May 2014,  the FASB issued accounting guidance on revenue recognition,  which provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts with customers.  The standard also requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature,  amount,  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts.  Companies have an option to use either a retrospective approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard.  There is no option for early adoption.  The provisions of this guidance will be effective as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our financial statements and have not yet selected a transition approach to implement the standard.  In July 2013,  the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires an entity to net its liability for unrecognized tax positions against a net operating loss carryforward,  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward when 80 
Table of Contents 
settlement in this manner is available under the tax law.  The provisions of this guidance were effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year and did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In February 2013,  the FASB issued guidance that requires an entity to disclose information showing the effect of the items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the line items of net income.  The provisions of this guidance were effective prospectively as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year.  Accordingly,  we included enhanced footnote disclosure for the years ended December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013 in Note 13.  In July 2012,  the FASB issued accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessmentwhile no further analysis would be required if it passes.  The provisions of this guidance were effective for 2013 and have had no impact on our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test results.  In December 2011,  the FASB issued disclosure requirements that were intended to enhance current disclosures on offsetting financial assets and liabilities.  The disclosures required an entity to disclose both gross and net information about derivative instruments accounted for in accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging that are eligible for offset on the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.  The provisions of these disclosure requirements were effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year.  Accordingly,  we included enhanced footnote disclosure in Note 10.  Note 3 — Restructuring,  Impairment and Integration Charges 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food,  snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint,  including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency.  The 2014 Productivity Plan is in addition to the 2012 Productivity Plan and is expected to continue the benefits of that plan.  In 2014 and 2013,  we incurred restructuring charges of $357 million ($262 million after-tax or $017 per share) and $53 million ($39 million after-tax or $002 per share),  respectively,  in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan.  All of these charges were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance and other employee-related costs,  asset impairments (all non-cash),  and contract termination costs.  Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 27,  2014 is expected to be paid by the end of 2015.

Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on discounted future cash flows.  Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.

Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 272014,  December 28,  2013 and December 29,  2012.  In 2014,  we performed the impairment analysis for goodwill for all our reporting units using the qualitative approach and concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts.  After reaching this conclusion,  no further testing was performed.  In 2014 and 2012,  we recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Europe for nonamortizable intangible assets of $23 million in each year.  We recognized no impairment charges for nonamortizable intangible assets in 2013.  Based on our year-end assessment,  the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PAB exceed their carrying values.  However,  there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PAB is reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PAB is CSD business do not achieve our estimated future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.  We have also analyzed the impact of the recent economic and political developments in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 27,  2014.  However,  a further deterioration in these conditions in Russia could potentially require us to record an impairment charge for these assets in the future.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),  which was signed into law in the second quarter of 2010,  changed the tax treatment related to an existing retiree drug subsidy (RDS) available to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D.  As a result of the PPACA,  RDS payments became taxable in tax years beginning in 2013by requiring the amount of the subsidy received to be offset against our deduction for health care expenses.  In the first quarter of 2012,  we began pre-paying funds within our 401(h) accounts intended to fully cover prescription drug benefit liabilities for Medicare eligible retirees.  As a result,  the receipt of future Medicare subsidy payments for prescription drugs will not be taxable and consequently we recorded a $55 million tax benefit reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2012.  88

For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies,  including our reserves for income taxessee 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction United States Mexico United Kingdom Canada (Domestic) Canada (International) Russia 
Years Open to Audit 
Years Currently Under Audit 
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matterwe believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We believe that it is reasonably possible that our reserves for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $300 million within the next 12 months as a result of the completion of audits in various jurisdictions.  In the fourth quarter of 2013,  we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2003 through 2009.  As a result,  we made U.S.  Federal net cash tax payments of $758 million,  including interest.  The settlement reduced our 2013 net cash provided by operating activities and our reserves for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2003 through 2012 and resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.  In addition,  payments for other U.S.  Federal,  state and local tax matters related to open tax years totaling $226 million were made in 2013.  In 2012,  we received a favorable tax court decision related to the classification of financial instruments resulting in a non-cash tax benefit of $217 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.  See additional unaudited information in 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  As of December 27,  2014,  the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilitieswas $1587 million.  We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The gross amount of interest accrued,  reported in other liabilities,  was $141 million as of December 27,  2014,  of which $31 million of expense was recognized in 2014.  The gross amount of interest accrued,  reported in other liabilitieswas $164 million as of December 28,  2013,  of which $36 million of expense was recognized in 2013.

Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $104 billion at year-end 2014 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $01 billion in 2015,  $98 billion between 2016 and 2034 and $05 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Undistributed International Earnings As of December 27,  2014,  we had approximately $378 billion of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  therefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized U.S.  tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.  Note 6 — Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  Stock options,  restricted stock units (RSUs)performance stock units (PSUs) and PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period.  PSUs are awards where the number of shares delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period depends on PepsiCo is performance against specified targets.  During the vesting period,  RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.  PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo is absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo is Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three-year performance period.  The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs as well as PEPunits.  As of December 27,  2014,  98 million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.

The following table summarizes our total stock-based compensation expense: Stock-based compensation expense Merger and integration charges Restructuring and impairment benefits Total Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to stock-based compensation 
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company is stock on the date of grant.  The fair value of PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company is stock on the date of grant with the exception of market-based awards,  for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value.  The Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however,  it also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.  Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied,  provided that the requisite service has been provided.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  We do not backdate,  reprice or grant stock-based compensation awards retroactively.  Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.  The fair value of stock-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  primarily three years.  Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award.  Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs,  or a combination thereof.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted a combination of 60% PEPunits measuring both absolute and relative stock price performance and 40% long-term cash based on achievement of specific performance operating metrics.  Certain executives are granted performance-based stock units which require the achievement of specified financial and/or operational performance metrics.  The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award.  Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2014 6 years 19% 16% 29% 
Expected life Risk-free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield 
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent 91

Note 7 — Pension,  Retiree Medical and Savings Plans In the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2012,  the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S.  defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant is pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or IRA).  In December 2014 and 2012,  we made a discretionary contribution of $388 million and $405 million,  respectively,  to fund substantially all of these payments.  The Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash settlement charge of $141 million ($88 million after-tax or $006 per share) in 2014 and $195 million ($131 million after-tax or $008 per share) in 2012 as a result of these transactions.  See additional unaudited information in 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The provisions of both the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act are reflected in our retiree medical expenses and liabilities and were not material to our financial statements.  During 2014,  we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new set of mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries,  adjusted to reflect our experience and future expectations.  This resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of our U.S.  pension and retiree medical programs.  We also reviewed and revised other demographic assumptions to reflect recent experience.  The net effect of these changes and certain plan design changes resulted in an increase of approximately $150 million in the projected benefit obligation at December 27,  2014.  Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions,  including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets,  and from changes in our assumptions are determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

Future Benefit Payments and Funding Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2015 
Pension 
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act.  Subsidies are expected to be approximately $3 million for each of the years from 2015 through 2019 and approximately $13 million in total for 2020 through 2024.  
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.  In 2015,  we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $225 million,  with approximately $55 million for retiree medical benefits.  Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 75% for 2015 and 2014.  Our target investment allocations for U.S.  plan assets are as follows: 2015 40% 33% 22% 5% 
Fixed income U.S.  equity International equity Real estate 
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  The expected return on plan assets is based on our plan investment strategy and our expectations for longterm rates of return by asset class,  taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.  To calculate the expected return on plan assets,  our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value.  For all other asset categories,  we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.

Certain U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans,  which are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirementand we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  As of February 2012,  certain U.S.  employees earning a benefit under one of our defined benefit pension plans were no longer eligible for Company matching contributions on their 401(k) contributions.  Certain U.S.  salaried employees,  who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan,  are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.  In 2014,  2013 and 2012,  our total Company contributions were $130 million,  $122 million and $109 millionrespectively.  For additional unaudited information on our pension and retiree medical plans and related accounting policies and assumptions,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Note 8 — Related Party Transactions Our related party transactions in 2014,  2013 and 2012 are not material.  We coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the contract negotiations of sweeteners and other raw material requirements,  including aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting party,  we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  101

In addition,  our joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks sell finished goods (ready-to-drink teas and coffees,  respectively) to us and our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Consistent with accounting for equity method investments,  our joint venture revenue is not included in our consolidated net revenue.  Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations.  Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.

In 2014,  we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 9,  2019.  The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $37725 billion,  subject to customary terms and conditions.  We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $45 billion.  Additionally,  we may,  once a year,  request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.  Also,  in 2014,  we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 8,  2015.  The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $37725 billion,  subject to customary terms and conditions.  We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $45 billion.  We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year,  which would mature no later than the then effective termination date.  The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $2925 billion five-year credit agreement dated as of June 10,  2013 and our $2925 billion 364-Day credit agreement dated as of June 10,  2013.  Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.  Subject to certain conditions,  we may borrow,  prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements.  As of December 27,  2014,  there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.  In addition,  as of December 27,  2014,  our international debt of $228 million was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit.  These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.  Long-Term Contractual Commitments (a) The following table summarizes our long-term contractual commitments by period: 
Long-term debt obligations(b) Interest on debt obligations(c) Operating leases Purchasing commitments(d) Marketing commitments(d) 
(a) Based on year-end foreign exchange rates.  We expect to make net cash tax payments of approximately $300 million within the next 12 months,  as discussed further in Note 5.  Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any other settlements.  (b) Excludes $4096 million related to current maturities of long-term debt,  $196 million related to the fair value step-up of debt acquired in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS and $179 million related to the increase in carrying value of long-term debt representing the gains on our fair value interest rate swaps.  (c) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 27,  2014.  (d) Primarily reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 27,  2014.  
Most long-term contractual commitments,  except for our long-term debt obligations,  are not recorded on our balance sheet.  Operating leases primarily represent building leases.  Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges and orange juice.  Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing.  Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis.  Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations.  103

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  See Note 8 regarding contracts related to certain of our bottlers.  See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  Note 10 — Financial Instruments Derivatives We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 
 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and interest rates.  
In the normal course of business,  we manage commodity price,  foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful costsaving opportunities or efficiencies,  including the use of derivatives.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price,  foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  the effective portion of changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a resultany change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly,  including reviewing netting agreements,  if any,  and a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.  Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders,  pricing agreements and derivative instruments,  which include swaps and futures.  In addition,  risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for agricultural products,  energy and metals.  Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge 104 
Table of Contents 
accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented.  Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,  general and administrative expenses,  depending on the underlying commodity.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.  Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $12 billion as of December 27,  2014 and $14 billion as of December 28,  2013.  Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 49% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 23% of our net revenue in 2014.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign exchange risks.  Additionally,  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.  We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers,  negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $27 billion as of December 27,  2014 and $25 billion as of December 28,  2013.  Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting was not material for all periods presented.  For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  all losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no material net impact on earnings.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments includingbut not limited to,  interest rate swaps,  cross-currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness has been swapped to floating rates.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and crosscurrency interest rate swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  The notional values of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013 were $93 billion and $79 billion,  respectively.  Ineffectiveness,  for those interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting were not material for all periods presented.  As of December 27,  2014,  approximately 25% of total debt,  after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments,  was exposed to variable rates,  compared to 31% as of December 28,  2013.  Available-for-Sale Securities Investments in debt and equity marketable securities,  other than investments accounted for under the equity method,  are classified as available-for-sale.  All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 105 
Table of Contents 
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.  Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity.  Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in marketable debt securities as of December 27,  2014 were not material.  The pre-tax unrealized gains on our investments in marketable equity securities were $111 million and $122 million as of December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013,  respectively.  Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized.  We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired.  In making this judgment,  we evaluate,  among other things,  the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell,  or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell,  the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  Our assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.  We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges for the years ended December 27,  2014 and December 28,  2013.

Note 11 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs,  PSUs,  PEPunits and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Out-of-themoney options during 2014 were nominal.  Options to purchase 06 million shares in 2013 and 96 million shares in 2012 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.  These out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $8225 in 2014,  $7569 in 2013 and $6764 in 2012.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information 
productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our foodsnack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint,  including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency.  
Organic,  core and constant currency results,  as well as free cash flow excluding certain items,  are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below.  However,  we believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP reporting measures.  
2012 Productivity Plan 
Commodity Mark-to-Market Net Impact In the year ended December 27,  2014,  we recognized mark-to-market net losses of $68 million on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In the year ended December 28,  2013,  we recognized $72  million of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In the year ended December 292012,  we recognized $65 million of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  energy and metals.  Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses,  as either cost of sales or selling,  general and administrative expensesdepending on the underlying commodity.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.  
Merger and Integration Charges In the year ended December  28,  2013,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $10 million related to our acquisition of WBD recorded in the Europe segment.  In the year ended December 292012,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $16  million related to our acquisition of WBD,  including $11 million recorded in the Europe segment and $5 million recorded in interest expense.  
Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
In the year ended December  27,  2014,  we incurred restructuring charges of $61  million in conjunction with the 2012 Productivity Plan.  In the year ended December 28,  2013,  we incurred restructuring charges of $110 million in conjunction with our 2012 Productivity Plan.  In the year ended December 29,  2012,  we incurred restructuring charges of $279 million in conjunction with our 2012 Productivity Plan.  The 2012 Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food,  snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo is operations,  go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing,  warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures,  with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.

Restructuring and Other Charges Related to the Transaction with Tingyi In the year ended December 29,  2012,  we recorded restructuring and other charges of $150 million in the AMEA segment related to the transaction with Tingyi.  
Free Cash Flow (excluding certain items) Free cash flow (excluding certain items) is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance.  This is not a measure defined by U.S.  GAAP.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  Additionally,  we consider certain other items in evaluating free cash flow that we believe investors should consider in evaluating our free cash flow results.  See page 66 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources — Free Cash Flow" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S.  GAAP.
