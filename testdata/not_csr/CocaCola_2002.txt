Chairman is Statement 
On behalf of the Board of Directors,  I would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution in this successful year 
 am pleased to report that Coca-Cola HBC achieved strong profit and volume growth in line with expectations in 2002.  Despite difficult trading circumstances in many territories in terms of the economic environment and adverse weather conditions during the summervolume increased by 7% to 1268 million unit casesnet profit improved significantly to over n35 millioncompared to a loss of n20 million for 2001,  EBITDA increased by 17% to n579 million and EBIT increased by 57% to n186 million (on a constant territory basis).  I am especially pleased to note the successful integration into the company of the Russian territories acquired in late November 2001 and the Baltic states of Estonia,  Latvia,  and Lithuania acquired in January 2002.  These countries are now very much a part of the company and reported particularly strong performance during the year.  Other events of significance include the acquisitionin partnership with The Coca-Cola Companyof two natural mineral water companies,  Valser Mineralquellen AG in Switzerland and Dorna Apemin SA in Romania.  With these acquisitions and the continued rollout of juice,  tea,  coffee,  water,  sports and energy drinks across our territories,  as well as innovation in our very strong carbonated soft drinks range,  we remain focused on our objective to become a more diversified alcohol-free beverage company.  Corporate social responsibility continues to gain importance in the business world as a result of recent events in which the trust and reputation of a number of companies has suffered.  TraditionallyCoca-Cola HBC has played a strong role in supporting each of the communities it serves.  As the expectations of consumers and stakeholders today have changed,  the management of Coca-Cola HBC is demonstrating its commitment and the Board of Directors is taking responsibility for this important aspect of corporate development.  
In July,  I was extremely saddened to report the death of Mr Constantine (Dino) Leventis.  Dino had served as deputy chairman of the Board of Coca-Cola HBC and as chairman of the A. G.  Leventis Foundation and his contribution over the years has been immeasurable.  From the sponsorship of agricultural schools and environmental projects in Nigeria to the promotion of Hellenic culture and the conservation of significant archaeological sites and historic buildings in Greece and Cyprus,  as well as by providing support to international museums for Greek and Cypriot antiquities,  Dino worked tirelessly and will be sorely missed.  I am pleased to announce that Mr Harry Leventis has since been appointed to the Board.  In October 2002,  the company was successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  We anticipate that this will result in greater access to the international investment community and will expand investment analyst coverage of our company to provide a more accurate comparison within the alcohol-free beverage industry and our international peer group.  In closing,  on behalf of the Board of DirectorsI would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution in this successful year.  It is because of the passion and enthusiasm of our people coupled with our strong management team that I am confident of continued progress in the years ahead.

Journey towards becoming a World Class Selling Organisation 
Throughout 2002,  Coca-Cola HBC and its employees were focused on the pursuit of our vision: becoming a World Class Selling Organisation.  A great deal of progress was made in all key areas and a number of milestones were reached.  
We have achieved an impressive record since Coca-Cola HBC is creation less than three years ago.  Progress in implementing our plan to become a World Class Selling Organisation continued in 2002 and helped us to grow volume by 7% and EBITDA by 17% on a constant territory basis.  Our focus on improving the performance of the underlying business led to a substantial increase in ROIC from 19% in 2000 to 51% this year.  Our business in Russia and the Baltics,  acquired in late 2001 and early 2002 respectively,  has made significant progress.  Volume in these countries increased by 17% and EBITDA grew by more than four times.  These territories already form a significant part of our company which will grow in the future.  These successes demonstrate that we have the capability to grow rapidly and deliver results; they show that we have built strong teams at all levels; and they underscore our ability to truly innovate and influence consumer tastes and trends.  
We believe that the World Class Selling vision is the optimal platform from which to further develop Coca-Cola HBC,  to maintain our strong momentumand to release the full potential of all our assets.  
Brand Coca-Cola products are the backbone of our business and today represent over 50% of our sales.  The prospects for the Coca-Cola brands remain very strong as we broaden,  develop,  and reinvigorate their appeal to consumers,  who now number more than 500 million across our 26 countries.  
Complementing this core strength,  we aim to expand the opportunity that we see in the noncarbonated beverage sector.  Already in 2002,  Coca-Cola HBC has 
increased its noncarbonated beverage volume from 13% to 15% as a proportion of our total volume.  This is particularly impressive given that total volume increased by 7% during this period.  Underlining our confidence and expectations in this segmentwe anticipate that noncarbonated beverages will represent 20% of our total volume by 2004.  A key growth area within this sector is water.  During 2002the acquisitions of the mineral water companies Dorna Apemin S. A.  and Valser Mineralquellen AG,  in partnership with The Coca-Cola Company,  marked an important step to becoming a more diverse alcoholfree beverage company.  In order to achieve these objectives,  we rely heavily on the quality and effectiveness of our sales forcewhich builds our business,  outlet by outlet,  and focuses on the detail required to grow each categoryeach brand,  and each package.  In the past year,  we substantially increased the size of our sales team and continued investing in the development of our sales people.  We truly believe that by having a highly trained and motivated sales force,  we will successfully activate our products in the marketplace and grow our business.  In 2002,  the extensive placement of single-serve cold drink equipment in the marketplace and a relentless focus on market activation resulted in significant profitable volume growth.  The right people at every level are key to our success.  Therefore,  we are dedicated to training and development,  recognising the need to manage our rapidly growing business and to provide succession planning for all key management positions.  The successful listing on the New York Stock Exchange has substantially increased the visibility of Coca-Cola HBC.  It gives us greater exposure to the international investment community and facilitates direct comparison with our peer companies in the non-alcoholic beverage sector across the world.  
2002 was a highly successful year for Coca-Cola HBCas the company rose above the significant challenges in the broader market to deliver very strong volume and,  more importantly,  profit growth.  But this is just the beginning.  We have a long journey ahead of us and need to keep growing our brands,  developing our people,  activating the marketplace,  and delivering strong financial performance to achieve our single most important financial goal: return superior value to our shareholders.  
1.  a mark made to attest 
manufacture or quality or to designate ownership 
Coca-Cola is the world is most popular brand and consumer appetite remains strong for the portfolio of TCCC products: Coca-Cola,  Coca-Cola light (also known as Diet Coca-Cola),  Fantaand Sprite.  Much of Coca-Cola HBC is strength lies in these core brands.  Whilst these will remain absolutely focal to our futurewe are complementing them by expanding and innovating within our portfolio to maximise the potential for profitable growth.  Our goal over time is to become a more diverse alcohol-free beverage company providing a complete range of non-alcoholic beverages for every consumer and for every occasion.  
Exploiting carbonated soft drinks Throughout 2002,  as in the past,  we focused on making all Coca-Cola brands more appealing,  available,  and relevant for our many consumers,  drawn from across our 26 diverse individual markets.  In the past year,  our people have created many thousands of local promotions,  events,  and sponsorship schemes to fortify and grow these brands in an enduring and meaningful way.  Excellent examples of brand activation are the many beach programmes that we mounted during the peak summer season in markets such as Romania,  Bulgaria,  Greece,  and Italy.  There are 500 kilometres of sandy Baltic beaches,  which are visited by an estimated six million consumers annually.  To fully exploit this 
'Our goal over time is to provide a complete range of non-alcoholic beverages for every consumer and for every occasion" 
re, ju, ve, nate (vt): 1.  to restore something is condition,  to make it more vigorous,  dynamic and effective market,  Coca-Cola HBC launched a marketing programme aimed at brand activation and product availability.  In terms of sales,  new branded coolers were strategically placed outside our customers' kiosks,  backed up by sales promoters with thermal insulated backpacks who were delivering ice-cold single servings of Coca-Cola products directly to the consumer.  This is a typical example of the variety of imaginative,  locally devised and managed outdoor activities that were staged across all 26 countries within the company during 2002.  Innovation and rejuvenation have played an integral part in our growth strategy,  bringing life and added energy to our well-established brands with new flavours,  exciting packaging innovations,  dynamic marketing,  and striking advertising.  During 2002,  Coca-Cola light was reinvented for a new generation of consumers in a bold,  silver bottle.  Supporting the initiative was a sophisticated 'Silver Lady' or 'Silver Man' integrated marketing and advertising campaign.  The launch of Coca-Cola light with lemon gave a familiar product a new appeal across several countries,  particularly in our established markets,  such as Northern Ireland,  Switzerlandand Austria.  
nnova tion 
The Fanta range also increased volume across many countries with the introduction of the uniqueproprietary 'Splash' bottle that added colour and light to the traditional product.  In many countriesespecially in Eastern and Central Europe,  consumers prefer a variety of flavours,  so we introduced many extensions during the year,  such as Blood OrangeExotic,  Sparkling Grapefruit,  and Crazy Citrus.  Some of these flavours were designed to appeal specifically to local tastes.  In Romania,  locally conceptualised Fanta Shokata (featuring the traditional flavour of the elder flower),  Fanta Madness,  and Fanta Icy Lemon inspired consumers' imagination and have contributed to profitable volume growth.  Such innovations have proved a successful way to keep the Fanta brand fresh,  vibrant,  and growing.  Sprite stimulated the younger generation in Russia and Greece with the launch of lively 'take it over the edge' graffiti graphics on collectible cans designed by local artists.  In Greece,  Sprite light was relaunched as Sprite Zero in a profitable 250ml slim can,  which at the same time was very stylish,  distinctive,  and appealed to the body-conscious youth market.  A daring,  much talked about media campaign (the campaign song reached number 1 in the Greek charts) led the marketing and promotional effortwhich resulted in a significant sales increase.  
Expansion of noncarbonated soft drinks Noncarbonated soft drinks have an exciting future in all of Coca-Cola HBC is markets.  The bottled water segment continued to show rapid growth.  Coca-Cola HBC pursues a 'dual water strategy' by offering both natural mineral water and table water products,  reflecting market preferences.  During the year,  the acquisition of the Valser range in Switzerland was a solid and strategically important step into the natural mineral water segment there.  It was rapidly followed by the acquisition of the Dorna range of naturally sparkling mineral waters in Romania.  Coca-Cola HBC is already firmly established in the water segment in many markets.  For example,  in Greece,  the Avra mineral water brand is the market leader.  In addition to mineral water,  the company continued to expand the availability of its table water,  principally BonAqua.  In total,  water volume grew by 38% in 2002.  2002 was a good year for Coca-Cola HBC is juice brands.  We offer three major brands of juice and juice drinks: Minute Maid,  the leading juice brand of 
in, no, va, tion (n): 1.  the act or process of inventing or introducing something new The Coca-Cola Company,  popular in Switzerland and Italy; Amita,  the most popular juice brand in Greece; and Cappy,  an international brand available in Austria,  Bosnia & Herzegovina,  Bulgaria,  CroatiaCzech Republic,  Poland,  Romania,  Slovakiaand Slovenia.  Minute Maid continued its progress in Italy and Switzerland during the year.  Amita continues to be the market leader in the juice sector in Greece.  Innovative new products led by Amita Sun (the only juice enriched with calcium and vitamins) and Amita Classic (a single serving in a distinctive glass bottle) attracted significant consumer interest.  The strength of the Cappy brand has been firmly established in a number of Central and East European countries,  where it enjoys market leadership (Slovakia,  Croatia,  Romania).  In additionwe have continued to successfully launch Cappy in other markets,  such as Bulgaria.  During 2002,  the Cappy range achieved market leadership within just a few months of launch in the important children is market segment in Austria.  
This achievement resulted from the powerful combination of the strong Cappy brand with packaging that featured popular Disney characters to produce products such as 'Mickey is Abenteuer. ' Teas and sports and energy drinks expanded into new markets and substantially grew volume during 2002,  supported by new product launches and innovative marketing.  2002 was also a strong year for Nestea,  with volume growing an impressive 21%.  Nestea was successfully rebranded and repackaged across a host of Coca-Cola HBC markets during the year and a number of new flavour extensions were introducedsuch as Red Fruits or Mint & Ginseng.  The new look and improved range contributed strongly to the exceptional growth in sales of this brand.  PowerAde,  which is available in a number of our countries,  was repackaged in an impressive new bottle design with a unique sports cap.  Sales of the product almost doubled during the year.  Our presence in the energy drink sector was further strengthened through the introduction in some of our markets of Burn.

JOURNEY 
 u st omers 
'We use creativity and innovation in all of our countries to place products within consumers' reach" 
For example,  at convenience stores in several of our markets,  in addition to the traditional coolers located elsewhere in the outlet,  we intensified our efforts to place additional units at checkout counters.  This makes ice-cold products readily available at payment points for immediate consumption.  In a number of countrieswe placed coolers outside kiosks,  giving consumers the opportunity to make purchases by providing extra convenience and impulse.  Our Bosnia & Herzegovina sales team thought of hanging coolers on the sides of kiosks to make our products more visible.  In placing products within consumers' reach,  different countries have developed different approaches through their creativity and innovation.  In established markets,  like Greece,  ice-cold products are positioned on streets,  in plazas,  and indeed everywhere where there may be demand.  A number of key countries around the Mediterranean depend 
on tourism and on a beach with little in the way of permanent kiosks,  we multiplied the on-beach sales force by a factor of five to more fully activate the availability of ice-cold refreshments and drive impulse purchases.  Brand Coca-Cola is the favourite carbonated soft drink of consumers across our diverse portfolio of countries,  refreshing consumers at all types of social gatherings,  events,  and occasions.  During 2002,  consolidating on this strong position,  we implemented a number of initiatives to further activate all Coca-Cola brands,  strengthening their association with mealtimes and other social or family gatherings.  Activating carbonated drinks in Greece,  we have supplied a number of quick service restaurants with combo meal boards and have printed Coca-Cola branded menus.  In Polandenhanced association with mealtimes further

activati activated different channels,  including hypermarkets,  cinemas,  kiosks,  and internet cafes.  Capitalising on local knowledge in the Baltics,  we strongly promoted association of our brands with chicken,  a popular local convenience meal,  substantially boosting appeal and activation in 800 stores in these markets.  Similar activation of our noncarbonated drink brands is helping us to exploit the enormous potential that exists for mealtime and social consumption of our water,  juice,  juice drinks,  and teas.  Greater activation,  through association with social occasions and mealtimes,  is extending the appeal of all our productscreating new opportunities for us to connect with consumers.

Financial review 2002 
Coca-Cola HBC reported excellent results for the full year 2002,  further demonstrating the strength of our business.  Despite difficult trading circumstances in many territories in terms of the economic environment and adverse weather conditions during the summer,  constant territory volume increased by 7% to 1268 million unit cases.  The improvement in our profitability was even stronger as our net profit increased to n35m compared to a loss of n20m for 2001 on a constant territory basis.  The highlights of the company and segmental financial results are summarised below:

In profitably managing growth during the year,  we provided appropriate focus on our carbonated soft drink brands (CSDs),  which,  in 2002,  accounted for 85% of the business.  This strength in CSDs is balanced by the considerable prospects of noncarbonated soft drinks (non CSDs),  especially in the water segment.  On this basiswe expect that noncarbonated beverages will represent 20% of our total volume in 2004.  This is supported by our recent acquisitions of the Swiss mineral water business Valser Mineralquellen AG and the Romanian mineral water business Dorna Apemin S. A.,  as well as investment in our greenfield water plant in Hungary,  which commenced operations in the fourth quarter.  Each of these transactions was pursued jointly with The Coca-Cola Company.  Together,  Coca-Cola HBC and The Coca-Cola Company are committed to the World Class journey in order to reach long term goals of profitable volume growth through continuous development of carbonated and noncarbonated beverages,  leveraging on enormous potential in the natural mineral water and processed water segments,  and careful fiscal measures to ensure that Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) exceeds our Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

ESTABLISHED MARKETS 
Volume in established markets grew by 3% to 518 million unit cases compared to 2001.  In all established markets,  we have sought to diversify the range of product choices available to consumers,  particularly in juice and water.  We kept investing in Italy in 2002 and expect to realise volume and profit potential through our additional 200 sales people and placement of 30000 coolers.  Growth of more than 5% in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was mainly driven by more profitable 500ml packs in the immediate consumption channel.  A focus on new product launches broadened the product and package choices available to consumers.  In Greece,  we still see excellent results based on the investment made in 2001 in the relaunch of the Amita juice brand,  which,  together with Avra water,  shows strong growth within the noncarbonated beverage segment.  Coca-Cola light with lemon has been a successful product launch in Austria,  Switzerland,  and Northern Ireland.  Our acquisition of the leading Swiss mineral water companyValser Mineralquellen AG,  at the end of the third quarter 2002 will help us to meet consumer demand in Switzerland and will increase our strength in the noncarbonated segment.  Established markets contributed n314m to company EBITDA,  7% above prior year.  Across this segment,  we have seen the benefits of promoting the higher margin single serve packages,  together with selective price increases.  At the same time,  we are working to improve operating efficiencies and cost control.  For examplethis enabled Austria to face hard pricing competition based on influence from the German market.  Consistent with their volume growth,  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland delivered significant EBITDA growth for the year,  assisted by a favourable package mix and efficient operating expense management.

Volume in our developing markets was 262 million unit cases,  5% higher than last year.  EBITDA was 28% higher than 2001 as a result of focus on better pricing,  gross margin improvement,  and operating expense control.  As a result of our increased efforts to meet consumer demand and customer expectations,  we see that the generated volume also impacted growth in profit levels.  In Poland,  we reached 8% volume growth due to an improved pricing strategy,  intensive cooler placement,  and successful promotional activities.  Growth of more than 9% in the Czech Republic for the year was assisted by the strong performance of Lift,  which,  after a relaunch,  was able to compete in a very price sensitive environment.  Throughout the developing markets,  we continued to increase the range of products and package sizes available to consumers during 2002.  Launches of new Fanta flavours were extremely successful in Estonia and Latvia.  Consumer price promotions were targeted towards retaining customers and making our products affordable to as wide a range of consumers as possible.  These initiatives enabled us to overcome poorer summer weather and the floods.  EBITDA in developing markets grew by 28% versus 2001 to n93m on a constant territory basis,  in line with our continued goal to build sustainable and profitable businesses in these markets.  The improvement in EBITDA was achieved through targeted price increases coupled with a continued focus on expense control and the efficient use of assets.  All countries in this segment,  except Croatia,  are preparing for accession to the European Union in May 2004.  In Poland,  EBITDA growth for the year was over 100%,  assisted by savings on raw and other materials,  as well as effective control of operating expenses.  In the Baltics and the Czech Republic,  EBITDA growth was 79% and 24% respectively,  assisted by cost savings,  a favourable package mix,  and targeted price increases.

Throughout 2002,  emerging markets again performed very strongly.  Volume in emerging markets grew by 13% in 2002 to 489 million unit cases.  Russia,  a very important market in the segment,  achieved volume growth of 17% in 2002.  Economic stabilisationtogether with increased brand awareness and the successful launch of new products,  ensured this strong performance.  Nigeria delivered volume growth of 2% after strong growth in 2001.  Our investments in production infrastructure enabled us to meet a spur in market demand in the fourth quarter,  which was a result of increased government spending at year-end leading up to elections.  Based on increased capacity and better line utilisationNigeria delivered double-digit volume growth in the fourth quarter.  In the Ukraine,  volume growth for the year was 24% following new product launches,  significant in-trade investments,  and improved market presence.  In Romania,  we increased volume by 19% from the introduction of new Fanta flavours (Madness,  Shokata) and Schweppes Bitter Lemon,  as well as an overall improvement in economic conditions.  Serbia & Montenegro delivered volume growth of 30% with very strong performance of CSDs and some new product launches.  EBITDA in emerging markets for the full year was n172m,  representing growth of 34% on a constant territory basis.  Higher volume and wider product offering combined with better asset utilisation to achieve cost efficiencies across these territories.  The strongest performing operation in this segment was Russia,  with EBITDA growth of well over 100% versus prior year.  Building on profitable volume growth,  Russia was assisted by targeted price increases and savings in raw and packaging materials.  In Russia and the Ukraine,  the product range has expanded to include new products and flavours and both countries have seen the benefit of stabilising economic conditions.  Additionally,  we continue to see cost saving benefits from merger synergies in Russia.  In Nigeria,  profitability has been built on higher volumes,  combined with the full year benefit from the price increase implemented in October 2001.

Coca-Cola HBC Coca-Cola HBC is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers serving a population of over 500 million people in 26 countries.  CCHBC shares are listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE:EEEK),  with listings on the London (LSE:CCB) and Australian (ASX:CHB) Stock Exchanges.  CCHBC is American Depository Receipts are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:CCH).  
The measure excludes goodwill and the amortisation of goodwill.  EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and tax.  ROIC is calculated as EBITA (operating profit plus amortisation) less adjusted taxes divided by average invested capital (shareholders' equity plus interest bearing debt plus capital lease obligations).  
Overview of financial results Basis of the financial information This financial review covers the performance of the company.  The financial results are presented in euros,  which is the principal operating currency of the company.  We refer to information on a constant territory basis.  The constant territory basis includes the actual results for the acquisition of the new Russian territories and Baltic states of Estonia,  Latvia,  and Lithuania for the full year of 2001 to provide comparable information for 2002.  These accounts are prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The company also prepares accounts under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).  Our key performance measures for the growth of our business and its profitability in 2002 have been volume,  EBITDA and Return on Tangible Assets (ROTA).  From 2003 onwards,  we will measure our progress on our journey towards becoming a World Class Selling Organisation by volume,  operating profit (EBIT),  and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).  Volume is measured on a unit case basis.  EBITDA is defined as earnings before interesttax,  depreciation and amortisation,  and other non cash items.  In an international environment where financial statement presentation can differ significantly between countries,  EBITDA gives a consistent measure allowing comparison of performance with other businesses similar to ours.  ROTA is defined as return on tangible assets.  This measure focuses on returns from the productive capital invested in the business.  
Financial results for the year Sales Sales for the year increased 7% versus 2001 on a constant territory basis,  reflecting selective price increases in key markets and better channel mix.  This increase in sales was achieved despite stronger sales in water,  a product category that makes lower revenue per unit case than carbonated soft drinks.  Sales in our European markets increased by 7%.  The economics in our markets enabled us to increase revenue per case and grow earnings ahead of volume.  
Gross profit Gross margin,  on a constant territory basisincreased to 401% compared to 387% in 2001a significant increase that reflects our continued ability to manage our costs and perform with greater production efficiencies.  Our gross margin continues to improve as a result of targeted price increases and as the proportion of our sales in the more profitable packages continues to grow.  
Operating profit Operating profit (EBIT) increased by 57% on a constant territory basis for the full year,  reflecting a combination of strong volume growth,  significant gross margin improvement,  and controlled growth in our operating expenses.  
Net profit The net result of the company has been transformed from a loss position of n20m in 2001 to a solid profit of n35m in 2002,  on a constant territory basis (n2m profit on a reported basis in 2001).  
The significant turnaround achieved in 2002 is a result of our ability to manage all aspects of our business,  including profitable volume growthsuccessful cost management,  and implementation of operational efficiencies.  
Exchange impact 
projects to help us ensure a dynamic start in 2003.  We are continuing to focus capital investment on the higher profitability areas of the business.  We have redeployed assets and equipment within the company,  where possible,  to minimise the cash outflows on fixed assets,  as well as improve our return on existing assets.  
The euro weakened marginally during 2002 against some Central European currencies in which the company operates.  The company saw a small benefit in the translation of its results into euros as a result of this,  but also experienced an increase in foreign currency denominated costs (principally those which are dollar based).  The overall effect on the company was broadly neutral.  
Financing costs for 2002 totalled n60m (n66m in 2001).  Included in financing costs is the remeasurement of net monetary assets of subsidiaries operating in hyper-inflationary environments.  In 2002,  this amounted to n08m (n06m in 2001).  The company has six countries that operate in a hyper-inflationary economic environment,  namely,  Belarus,  Moldova,  RomaniaRussia,  Serbia & Montenegro,  and the Ukraine.  
Tax charge The underlying effective tax rate for the company is higher than the Greek statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of non-deductible expenses for tax purposes,  principally the amortisation of goodwill.  Statutory tax rates in the countries in which the company operates range from 0% to 38%.  Excluding the impact of non-deductible goodwill amortisationthe effective tax rate is 30%.  Our continuing reduction in the effective tax rate on profit before taxation and amortisation is attributable to overall enhanced profitability in country operations combined with a small recovery of previously unrecognised tax losses.

Return on Tangible Assets The capital investment in our business is substantialwith tangible fixed assets valued at approximately n20 billion.  Our priority is to maximise the efficiency and return on these assets and the Return on Tangible Assets (ROTA) has been one of our three key indicators of performance in 2002.  This measure focuses on returns from the productive capital invested in the business.  The measure excludes goodwill and the amortisation of goodwill.  In 2002,  ROTA was 142% compared with 83% in 2001 on a constant territory basis.  This increased return reflects the initiatives taken in 2000 and 2001 to deploy assets around the company in order to maximise their efficient use.  
Return on Invested Capital Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is one of our three key indicators of performance from 2003 onwards.  CCHBC is focus on the returns achieved from our capital investment reflects the efforts taken on our journey to meet and exceed our Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).  ROIC is calculated as EBITA (operating profit plus amortisation) less adjusted taxes divided by average invested capital (shareholders' equity plus interest bearing debt plus capital lease obligations).  In 2002ROIC was 51% compared with 32% in 2001 on a constant territory basis.  
Dividends A dividend of n018 per share (totalling n43m) for the year ended 31 December 2001 was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2002 and paid to company shareholders in June 2002.  This compares with a dividend declared and paid in 2001 of n42m.  
Acquisitions Minority interest in Switzerland On 30 December 2002,  we announced that we successfully closed the acquisition of the remaining 261% shareholding interest in our Swiss subsidiary.  The minority interest was held by EWN Getraenke Holdings GmbH ('EWN'),  a German closely 
held limited liability company.  The timing of the transaction,  which was originally planned for late 2003,  resulted in more beneficial terms for us,  as the minority shareholder will have no rights in the 2002 dividends of the Swiss business.  
Dorna Apemin S. A.  On 31 July 2002,  we announced our intention to acquire,  jointly with The Coca-Cola Companythe majority of the shares in Romania is premier natural mineral water company,  Dorna Apemin S. A.

We successfully closed the acquisition of Valser on 30 September 2002.  
Acquisition of bottling operations in Estonia,  Latvia,  and Lithuania On 2 January 2002,  we acquired all The Coca-Cola Company owned bottling operations in the Baltic countries of Estonia,  Latvia,  and Lithuania.  Further details of the acquisition are disclosed in the 2001 annual report.  
Acquisition of The Coca-Cola Company bottling operations in the Russian Federation On 23 November 2001,  the company acquired all The Coca-Cola Company owned bottling operations in Russia.  Further details of the acquisition are disclosed in the 2001 annual report.  
New York Stock Exchange listing We listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 10 October 2002.  We anticipate that this development will benefit all of our shareholders over the long term as our company becomes more visible to the international investment communityand will allow for more comparability with our international peer group.  
Treasury and funding Management of financial risk The financial risks faced by the company arise from the adverse movements in currency rates,  interest rates,  and commodity prices.  The CCHBC Board has approved CCHBC is Treasury Policy and Chart of Authority,  which provide the control framework for all treasury and treasury related transactions.  
Treasury policy and objectives CCHBC Group Treasury is responsible for managing the financial risks of CCHBC and all its subsidiaries in a controlled manner,  which is consistent with the Board of Directors' approved policies.  These policies include:  hedging transactional exposures to reduce risk and limit volatility.  Derivatives may be used provided they qualify as hedging activities defined by the policy;  ensuring that all transactions are executed in the most cost efficient manner,  are controlled effectively,  and are undertaken with approved counter-parties;  hedging of financial risks includes activities that reduce risk or convert one type of risk to another.  To qualify as hedging,  an activity should be expected to produce a measurable offset to the risk relating to an asset,  liability or committed or forecast transaction.  In the context of overall Treasury Policy,  and in line with Board approved operating parameters,  specific objectives apply to the management of financial risks.  These objectives are disclosed under their respective headings below.  
Operating parameters Authority to execute transactions,  including derivative activity with approved financial institutionshas been delegated by the Board of Directors to the Director of Tax and Treasury and the Group Treasurer.  Under this authority,  only specified permitted financial instruments,  including derivativesmay be used for specified permitted transactions.  The use of derivatives is restricted to circumstances that do not subject CCHBC to increased market risk.  The market rate risk created by the use of derivatives should be offset by the market rate risk on the specific underlying exposures they are hedging.  The estimated fair value of derivatives used to hedge or modify our risks fluctuates over time.  These fair value amounts should not be viewed in isolation,  but rather in relation to the fair values of the underlying hedged transactions and to the overall reduction in our exposure to adverse fluctuation in interest rates,  foreign exchange ratescommodity and other market risks.  
Borrowings and group funding arrangements Medium term funding for the company is based on the need to ensure a consistent supply of committed funding at group and subsidiary level,  at minimum cost given market conditions,  to meet the anticipated capital and operating funding requirements of the company.  Short term liquidity management is based on the requirement to obtain adequate and costeffective short term liquidity for the company.  As at 31 December 2002,  CCHBC had consolidated borrowings of n1511m (n1414m in 2001).  Of these facilities,  35% was classified as current debt and 65% as long term debt.  In order to meet its future funding requirementsthe company had,  as at 31 December 2002,  cash and cash equivalents of n106m,  and an undrawn multi-currency committed facility of n900m.  Of this facility,  100% will mature after more than one year (see Note 20 to the IFRS accounts).

Financing group debt No further bond issuance was undertaken during 2002.  The company replaced the n750m syndicated facility with a new n900m syndicated backstop facility (which is undrawn).  At the same time a new n10 billion Global Commercial Paper Programme was set up and is used to finance the company is working capital requirements.  The outstanding amount under the Commercial Paper Programme at the end of 2002 was n165m.  The new facility has a split maturity,  with n450m maturing in May 2005 and n450m maturing in May 2007.  The new facility received tighter pricing and a relaxation of covenant language from the company is core relationship banks.  Further issuance from the company is Euro Medium Term Note programme is planned subject to pricing objectives being achieved.  This will deliver the objective of reducing liquidity risk and will assist in maintaining the quality profile CCHBC continues to demonstrate in the debt capital markets.  
Interest rate management The company manages its interest rate costs using a mixture of interest rate swap risk management products.  These products consist of fixed and floating interest rate swaps and interest rate cap options.  Products that protect the company is interest rate risk have a range of maturities from one to three years.  As at balance sheet date,  the total amount of interest protection was 88% of total debt.  This amount consists of 42% of debt as interest rate swaps and 46% as interest rate cap options (2001,  42% using swaps).  During the year,  the company purchased interest rate cap options to hedge against adverse interest rate movements in respect of a notional principle sum of n663m.  This was done to provide stability to the company is three-year business plan and to comply with treasury policy.  The decision to purchase options versus swaps was taken in order to continue benefiting from the lower floating interest rate environmentwhile having in place protection against adverse interest rate movements.  The options and swaps are marked to market with gains and losses taken to the income statement.  The option premium is being expensed to the income 
statement through the option revaluation process.  The option is revalued using the Black-Scholes method.  
Foreign currency management The company is foreign exchange exposures arise primarily from adverse changes in exchange rates in countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  Due to this exposure,  the company is results are affected in several ways,  including:  raw materials purchased in currencies such as US dollars or euros can lead to higher cost of sales which,  if not recovered in local pricing,  will lead to reduced profit margins;  devaluations of weaker currencies that are accompanied by high inflation and declining purchasing power can adversely affect sales and unit case volume; and  as some operations have functional currencies other than the reporting currency (euro),  any change in the functional currency against the euro impacts the company is income statement and balance sheet when results are translated into euros.  
Derivative financial instruments The company uses derivative financial instrumentssuch as forward exchange contracts and currency options,  to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations.  These contracts normally mature within one year.  The company does not,  as a matter of policy,  enter into speculative derivative financial instruments.  Where possible,  the company hedged at least 50% of foreign exchange transaction exposures.  It is the company is policy to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.  
Commodities The company hedges exposures to changes in movements in market prices associated with raw material purchases primarily by using commodity futures.  Currently,  the company only holds sugar commodity futures.  These contracts normally mature within one to two years.  
Insurance and risk management The company risk and insurance function provides all operations with appropriate methodologies to identify,  assess,  and control key business risks.  External advisers have been used both to ratify the company risk management approach and to support the process centrally and locally.  The risk management process is continuous and ensures that risks arising from company changes and developments are identified,  assessed,  and managed.  Company insurances have been effected to provide catastrophe,  property,  and liability protection.  Local insurances have been arranged beneath the company covers to provide working loss protection and necessary legal compliance.  Best Practice Risk Control guidelines have been established and are audited against at all key locations.  These guidelines and audits focus specifically on Property Loss Control,  Safety Management,  Business Continuity Planning,  and Environmental Compliance.  Training coursesaddressing areas of weaknesses highlighted in auditshave been run for our operations.  
investigation of commercial practices of The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers in Europe.  The investigation commenced in July 1999,  when the European Commission visited CCHBC is offices in Austria and London.  This investigation may lead to the institution of formal proceedings by the European Commission against CCHBC is Austrian subsidiary in the course of 2003.  In the absence of such proceedings,  it is not possible to quantify the likelihood or materiality of any potential fines or restrictions of our practices.  In recent years,  customs authorities in some Central and East European countries have attempted to challenge the classification under which the company imports concentrate into these countries to produce our products.  Local authorities have argued that a classification with higher custom duties than the current classification should apply.  In 2001,  one such issue in Hungary was successfully resolved.  The company still has similar issues outstanding before the Polish and Romanian Custom Authorities.  At this time,  it is not possible to quantify the risk of a negative outcome in these cases.  
Contingencies and legal claims The Greek Competition Authority issued a decision on 25 January 2002,  imposing a fine on the company of approximately n3m and requiring changes in the company is commercial practices in respect of free on-loan coolers in certain outlets in Greece.  The fine relates to the company is commercial dealings with certain wholesalers during the period 19911999.  On 27 March 2002,  the company appealed this decision before the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal.  On 18 April 2002,  the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal accepted in part the company is interim application for suspension of the Greek Competition Authority is decision by suspending half of the amount of the fine imposed on the company by the Greek Competition Authority.

The remuneration of the directors is subject to the approval of shareholders.  Consistent with the approach for executive directors,  in order to be market competitive,  CCHBC has compared remuneration of non-executive directors against surveys of similar international businesses.  Greek law prohibits a director from voting on a proposal,  arrangement or contract in which the director is personally interested.  The company is major shareholders entered into a relationship agreement prior to the listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange; under the terms of this agreement,  directors nominated by such major shareholders are restricted from taking part inand voting at,  Board meetings in connection with matters in which the shareholder they represent has an interest.  In furtherance of its objective to adopt international best practices in corporate governance and in accordance with the standards set by recently adopted rules in the United States,  the company adopted a code of ethics for its directors and senior executives to prevent wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct,  full,  fair,  accuratetimely,  and understandable disclosureand compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations.

To achieve the business results required by CCHBCthe company must attract,  retain,  and motivate high calibre executives for whom it recognises there is an international market.  The human resources committee aims to provide total compensation that is competitive by reference to other multinational companies similar to CCHBC in terms of sizegeographic spread,  and complexity.  In line with 
its commitment to maximise shareholder valueCCHBC is policy is to link a significant proportion of remuneration for its senior staff to the performance of the business through incentive and stock option plans.  Equity related compensation of senior staff aligns the financial interests of senior management with those of shareholders.  In constructing and reviewing remuneration packages,  the emphasis is on linking pay to performance by rewarding effective management of business performance as well as individual achievement.  
Total remuneration CCHBC considers total remuneration measuring all components at the upper quartile against a comparative group of similar international companiesthereby allowing the company to attract and retain the level of talent necessary to grow the business.  
1.  Salary This reflects an executive is experience,  responsibilityand market value as determined by,  among other factors,  a comparison with similar multinational companies.  
2.  Management incentive plan All senior executives participate in the CCHBC Management Incentive Plan.  This plan applies to middle and senior ranking employees and is based on annual business performance against volume,  EBITDA,  and ROTA,  as well as individual accomplishments against objectives.  Starting from 2003,  EBIT will replace EBITDA and ROIC will replace ROTA as the criteria for business performance under the plan.  Individual objectives are set by senior management so as to be demanding but achievable.  The target award as a percentage of annual base salary increases with level of responsibility and varies from 15% up to 70% of an employee is annual base salary.  Exceptional business unit performance where objectives are exceeded may result in awards in excess of the individual target awards.  
3.  Long term incentive plan Senior staff participates in the CCHBC Long Term Incentive Plan.  The company adopted this cash based plan for implementation in 2003 as a replacement 
of the company stock option plan for middle ranking employees.  The plan covers successive three-year periods and incentive payouts will be based on ROIC performance against three-year objectives.  The target payout from the plan is determined on an individual basis based on performance and potential.  Exceptional business unit performance where objectives are exceeded may result in awards in excess of the individual target payout.  It is believed that this newly adopted plan will have a greater motivational impact on middle ranking employees because they can more directly link their efforts to the ROIC performance of their specific unit.

Senior executives of CCHBC are eligible to participate in the CCHBC Stock Option Plan.

At the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders held on 22 November 2001,  the basic terms and conditions of stock option grants were approved.  Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the average value of the mid-price quotation of the company is shares at close of trading on the Athens Stock Exchange over the last ten working days before the date of grant.  Options vest in one-third increments each year for three years and can be exercised for up to ten years from the date of award.  Options are approved by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of management,  based on a view of competitive market conditions for employee remuneration and employees' performance.  The Stock Option Award for the managing director is approved by the Board of Directors based on the recommendation of the human resources committee.  The company views stock options as a long term component of the total remuneration package of its senior executives,  whose roles have an impact on the results of the business as a whole,  and intends to continue issuing stock options to these employees taking into account,  among other factors,  its profit growth,  business prospects,  and financial conditionas well as individual employee performance and the competitive market conditions of employee 
During 2002,  the company granted phantom stock options to its senior executives.  The company intends to convert these phantom stock options into regular stock options subject to approval of the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders in 2003.

The committee operates under written terms of reference and its duties include the review of accounts prior to their recommendation to the Board for approval.  The committee reviews reports from the external auditors prior to approving the accounts and discusses issues arising from the interim and final audits and any matter the auditors may wish to discuss.  The audit committee discusses with the external auditors before the audit commences the nature and scope of the audit and ensures coordination where more than one audit firm is involved.  It is also responsible for reviewing the programme of the internal audit function and receiving summaries of internal audits.

This report describes and reviews the significant aspects of the internal control and risk management process.  The company has an internal audit function which reports to the audit committee.  Details of its role and process for reporting to the committee are given below.  
The Board receives updates on performance at each Board meeting in addition to a monthly report on business and financial performance.  A disclosure committee has recently been established and disclosure controls and procedures were adopted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the company is public disclosures.

This information gives comparisons against budgetsforecasts,  and prior year performance.  
Internal control processes The Board acknowledges that it has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the company has systems of financial control with respect to the various business environments in which it operates.  It should be noted that such financial systems can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatements or loss.

A key focus of the financial management strategy is protection of CCHBC is earnings stream and management of cash flow.  The internal audit function monitors the internal financial control system across all the countries in which CCHBC operates and reports to management and the audit committee on its findings.  The work of the internal auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to CCHBC determined by using a risk management approach to audit planning.  The external auditors,  Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers,  are engaged to express an opinion on the company report and accounts.  To do this,  they independently and objectively review the results and financial position of CCHBC.  They also review and test the system of internal financial control to the extent necessary for expressing their opinion.  Reports are given by the external auditors to the audit committee at each of their meetings.  
The identification and management of risk The company has in place a risk management framework for the identification,  assessment,  and control of key business risks.  Risks covered are those arising from a range of sources in three broad categories: the external environment in which the business operates,  the business processes,  and the information available for business decisions.  The risk identification and assessment process has been incorporated as part of the company is annual business plan process since 2001.  This covers all countries and involves senior management of the company and of each business unit.

We believe that this commitment to core values throughout the organisation contributes to our business success.  We cannot become a World Class Selling Organisation without consistently contributing to the communities in which we live and work.  The company is therefore taking steps to ensure that the principles of corporate social responsibility are a part of the business practice of its entire staff.  
Background High values and aspirations have always been a part of the practice of Coca-Cola HBC and its predecessors,  but recent developments in the global economy and business and the increasing scrutiny of the role of business have highlighted the need to integrate them into the work of the company in a more open and systematic way.

We are currently reviewing the way in which the company assumes its social responsibilities,  focusing on what is being done in the marketplace,  and in relation to the environment,  the workplace,  and community partnerships.  We have commissioned a professional team to conduct this review across a number of countries and regions through document researchquestionnaires,  and in-depth interviews.  Based on the conclusions,  we will formulate a new strategy for corporate social responsibility which will include qualitative and quantitative measurements.  We also expect this work to lead to new coordinated local examples of action in the community and in support of the environment.  We see markets as societies with sustainable economies.  We also see and accept a responsibility to use our knowledge and resources to make a positive difference.  The greatest positive contribution our company can make to its communities is the direct economic impact we make through successful business.  
in, teg, ri, ty (n): 1.  the quality of possessing and steadfastly adhering to high moral principles or professional standards 
Responsibility 'We are committed to honesty and integrity,  respect for the dignity and diversity of people,  support for the communities in which we operate,  and protection of the environment" 
There are choices to be made as to where we concentrate our efforts.  We believe that for an organisation such as Coca-Cola HBC,  the most effective areas on which to focus are the local communities in which we operate and their particular problems,  social,  health-related or environmental.  An example is our support for action to combat HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.  Another priority area is the 
standards that apply to the products which we use or sell (e.g.,  food quality).  The values to which we subscribe are integral to the successful conduct of our business and are being demonstrated in each of the areas to which corporate social responsibility is relevant,  the workplace,  the marketplace,  the environment,  and the community.  
Concern is shown for employee welfare,  not only through health care,  security,  and safety,  but also in fostering career and personal development.  It is our intention to create a workplace where ideas and contributions are valued and where responsibility and accountability are encouraged and rewarded.  This in turn creates the kind of innovative business growth that makes ours a successful business.  
Marketplace Workplace Many of the activities and actions on which we focus have been inherent in our culture and system for many years.  For example,  the Code of Business Conduct has been part of our organisational policy for many years and is readily accessible to employees.  This code details our corporate philosophy and our commitment to employees in terms of employment practices and personal development and it includes the responsibilities of employees and the company in terms of compliance with both the spirit and the letter of laws,  regulations,  and business ethics.  In the workplace,  Coca-Cola HBC aims to show respect and treat everyone with dignity and fairness.  The company encourages employees at all levels to develop and perform to their fullest potential.  
Coca-Cola HBC works to adhere to the highest ethical standards in the marketplace,  understanding that the quality of our products,  the integrity of our brands,  and the dedication of our people will build trust and develop mutually rewarding relationships.  By offering products and services that meet the beverage needs of our consumers,  we provide sound and rewarding business opportunities and benefits for our customers,  suppliers,  distributors,  and local communities.  
Environment We aim to conduct our business in a way that protects and preserves the environment.  We are integrating principles of environmental stewardship and sustainable development into our business decisions and processes and,  where appropriate,  are engaging in activities with external organisations to bring concrete benefits in the immediate and long term.  Environmental management has always been one of our key priorities.  We believe that our success depends on making an environmentally responsible commitment to our consumers and other stakeholders.  For this reason,  we have undertaken to make operations compliant with the internationally recognised ISO 14001 quality standard.  Switzerland became the first of our countries to achieve ISO 14001 certification,  in November 2001.  Greece and the Ukraine are now well advanced in the accreditation process and it is expected that over 85% of plants in the Coca-Cola HBC system will be approved by early 2004.  
We have already seen tangible environmental and financial benefits through significant savings in waterenergy,  and raw material consumption; the reduction of solid waste; increased reuse and recycling of materials; and the introduction of a waste water neutralisation and management process.  We believe that by continuously seeking to minimise the adverse effects of business on the environmentwe can create value for all stakeholders and the communities in which we operate.  
Community At Coca-Cola HBC,  we are aware that our relationships with all stakeholders are essential to our future success in the workplace,  the marketplaceand the local community.  Just as we are on a journey towards becoming a World Class Selling Organisation,  we are also on a journey to fulfil our mission concerning the enrichment of the lives of the communities we live in.  Our commitment is to invest time,  expertise,  and resources to provide economic opportunity,  improve quality of life,  and foster goodwill in our communities.  Together with governments,  organisations,  local groups,  and other members of civil society,  our system can help to enhance quality of life through a wide variety of initiatives.  Examples of the company is efforts to address needs are found throughout the entire system.  Some activities,  such as organising humanitarian aid following severe flooding in the Czech Republic and Austria,  are in response to emergencies in a single country.  Others,  like support provided to the EU Commission is conference in Greece on water conservation and ongoing funding of iniatives such as the 'Make a wish' foundation in Greece,  have relevance to a much broader community.  Long term support for environmental protection was also the impetus for the company funding development of new recycling technology for plastics in Switzerland.

and an ongoing annual programme conducted in several countries,  in which ill and orphaned youngsters are presented with gifts each Christmas.  A project in Greece,  aimed at informing and educating teenagers about environmental issues,  problems,  and solutionsqualifies participants to be 'Green Ambassadors. ' This title will give them a role in anti-littering measures during the 2004 Athens Olympics an event we are supporting as part of our commitment to sports development in many countries across Europe.  In doing all this,  Coca-Cola HBC strives to be a valuable partner in community relationships,  a neighbour of choice,  and a good corporate citizen.  
In supporting education and welfare for young peoplethe company is engaged in numerous initiatives.  Among these initiatives are providing holidays in Hungary for mentally and physically challenged children

Notes to the financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention,  as modified by the revaluation of certain land and buildings and the financial statements of certain subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies,  which are restated and expressed in terms of the measuring unit currency at the balance sheet date.  
1.  Basis of preparation and accounting policies Description of business Coca-Cola HBC S. A.  ('CCHBC") is incorporated in Greece and was formed in August 2000 through the merger of Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.  and Coca-Cola Beverages plc.  CCHBC and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the production and distribution of alcohol-free beverages,  under franchise from The Coca-Cola Company ('TCCC").

These financial statements are not included in this document,  but are available from the company is registered office at 9 Fragoklissias Street151 25 Maroussi,  Athens,  Greece.  Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings are those companies in which the group,  directly or indirectly,  has an interest of more than one-half of the voting rights or otherwise has power to exercise control over the operations.  Subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date on which effective control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.  All material intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated.  Where necessary,  accounting policies of subsidiaries are modified to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the group.  Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group,  the revenue can be reliably measured,  and when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer.  Earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit (loss) attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares that were in existence during the year.  Diluted earnings per share takes account of stock options,  for which the average share price for the year is in excess of the exercise price of the stock option.  Information is presented for earnings per share including and excluding exceptional items.  Intangible assets Goodwill and franchise agreements are recognised as intangible assets.  Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the share of net assets acquired.  Intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of twenty years.  Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised in operating expenses in the income statement.  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition from subsidiaries are treated as the assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries.  These balances are denominated in the currency of the subsidiary and are translated to euros on a consistent basis with the other assets and liabilities held in the subsidiary.  
1.  Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued) Property,  plant and equipment All property,  plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost.  Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits,  in excess of the original assessed standard of performance of the existing asset,  will flow to the operation.  All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.  Land and buildings are revalued by independent valuers every five years.  Increases in the carrying amount of land and buildings arising on revaluation are credited to the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity.  Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation reserve; all other decreases are charged to the income statement.  The revaluation surplus included in equity is directly transferred to retained earnings when the surplus is realised.

Freehold land is not depreciated as it is considered to have an indefinite life.  Impairment of long-lived assets Property,  plant and equipment and other non-current assets,  including goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount,  which is the higher of an asset is net selling price and value in use.  For the purposes of assessing impairment,  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.  Investment in associates Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.  Associated undertakings are those where the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or exercises significant influence,  but does not control.  Equity accounting involves recognising the group is share of the associates' profit or loss for the period in the income statement.  The group is interest in the associate is carried in the balance sheet at an amount that reflects its share of the net assets of the associate and includes goodwill on acquisition.

Notes to the financial statements 
Government grants relating to the purchase of property,  plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income,  and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the assets.  
1.  Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued) Other investments The group classifies its investments in debt and equity securities into the following categories: trading,  held-tomaturity and available-for-sale.  The classification is dependent on the purpose for which the investment was acquired.  Trading and available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value.  Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost.  Gains and losses on investments held as trading or available-for-sale are recognised in income.  Gains and losses on held-to-maturity investments are recognised in income when the investments are de-recognised or impaired.  Investments are classified as non-current assets,  unless they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date.  Government grants 
Foreign currency and translation Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  All differences are taken to the income statement,  with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings,  that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity.  These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment,  at which time they are recognised in the income statement.  Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.  The reporting currency of the group is euro.  The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated to euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  The income statements of overseas subsidiaries are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year.  The exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to equity.  On disposal of a foreign entity,  accumulated exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as a component of the gain or loss on disposal.  Entities operating in hyper-inflationary environments prepare financial statements that are recorded in accordance with IAS 29,  'Financial reporting in hyper-inflationary economies".  In hyper-inflationary countriesthe gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in finance costs.  CCHBC is operations in BelarusMoldova,  Romania,  Russia,  Serbia and Montenegro,  and Ukraine operate in hyper-inflationary environments.  Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term deposits that are highly liquid.  For the purpose of the cash flow statement,  bank overdrafts are considered as borrowings.  Loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost,  being the fair value of the consideration received and including acquisition charges associated with the loan or borrowing.  After initial recognition,  all interest-bearing loans and borrowings,  other than liabilities held for trading,  are subsequently measured at amortised cost.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.  Liabilities which are held for trading are subsequently measured at fair value.  In relation to liabilities,  which are held for trading (which are not part of a hedging relationship),  any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value is included in the net profit and loss for the period in which it arises.  For liabilities carried at amortised cost (which are not part of a hedging relationship),  any gain or loss is recognised in the net profit and loss when the liability is derecognised or impaired,  as well as through the amortisation process.  
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments,  including interest rate swaps,  options,  currency and commodity derivatives.  Their use is undertaken only to manage interest,  currency and commodity risk associated with the group is underlying business activities.  The group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.  The group recognises all derivative financial instruments,  such as interest rate swaps,  options,  forward exchange contracts,  and commodity futures,  in the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised periodically either in income or in equity,  depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting,  and if so,  whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  Generally,  changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income,  along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risks.  Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges,  to the extent that they are effective as hedgesare recorded in equity.  Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in income.  Credit risk The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.  Policies are in place to ensure that the sales of products and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.  Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.  The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.  Liquidity risk The group actively manages liquidity risk to ensure there are sufficient funds available for any short term and long term commitments.  Bank overdrafts and bank facilities,  both committed and uncommitted,  are used to manage this risk.  Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing the product to its present location and condition,  as follows: Raw materials and consumables: purchase cost either on a first-in,  first-out or weighted average basis.  Work in progress and finished goods: cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads.  Trade receivables Trade receivables are carried at anticipated realisable value.  Provision is made for doubtful debts and bad debts are written off in the period in which they are identified.  Leases Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.  Leases of property,  plant and equipment,  where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership,  are classified as finance leases.  Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments.  Each lease payment is allocated between liability and finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.  The corresponding rental obligations,  net of finance charges,  are included in other long term payables.  The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period.  Property,  plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.

The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in its territories,  the assets of which are generally held in separate trustee-administered funds.  The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and the relevant group companies,  after taking into account the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.  
1.  Basis of preparation and accounting policies (continued) Provisions Provisions are recognised as follows: when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed,  for example under an insurance contract,  the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when such reimbursement is virtually certain.  If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and,  where appropriate,  the risks specific to the liability.  Where discounting is used,  the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.  Employee benefits pensions and post retirement benefits 
For defined benefit pension plans,  pension costs are assessed using the projected unit credit method.  Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense when the cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses for each individual plan exceed 10% of the defined benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets,  in accordance with the valuations made by qualified actuaries.  The pension obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government securities which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.  Actuarial gains and losses are recognised over the average remaining service lives of employees.  The group is contributions to the defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.  Deferred taxes Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes.  Tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred income tax.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,  associates and joint ventures,  except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Franchise incentive arrangements TCCC,  at its sole discretion,  provides the group with various incentives,  including contributions toward the purchase of cold drink equipment.  Payments are made on placement of coolers and are based on franchise incentive arrangements.  The terms and conditions of these arrangements require reimbursement if certain conditions stipulated in the agreements are not met,  including minimum volume requirements.  Support payments received from TCCC for the placement of cold drink equipment are deducted from the cost of the related asset.  Dividends Dividends are recorded in the group is financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the group is shareholders.  Comparative figures Where necessary,  comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.  
CCHBC has one primary business segment,  being the bottling,  distribution and sale of non-alcoholic,  ready-todrink beverages.  The following market groupings are adopted for secondary segmental analysis: Established markets: Developing markets: Emerging markets:

5.  Exceptional operating items During the year,  CCHBC recognised deferred tax assets on losses that had previously not been recognised on acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages plc by Hellenic Bottling Company S. A..  In accordance with IAS 12 'Income Taxes",  when deferred tax assets on losses have not been recognised on acquisition and are subsequently recognised,  both deferred tax assets and goodwill are adjusted with corresponding entries to operating expense and taxation in the income statement.  The exceptional operating charge has been excluded from the calculation of EBITDA.  Therefore,  a charge of f60m has been recorded as an exceptional operating charge,  and a deferred tax credit of f60m included within taxation in the income statement.  In 2001,  CCHBC received f67m as an insurance settlement for losses incurred as a result of product contamination issues in Poland,  in June and July of 1999.

Notes to the financial statements 20.  Borrowings (continued) Financial liabilities represent fixed and floating rate borrowings held by the group.  The group hedges exposures to changes in interest rates and the fair value of debt by using a combination of floating and fixed interest rate swaps.  Financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents of f1055m in 2002 (2001: f1526m).  Financial assets and liabilities falling due within one year exclude all debtors and creditors,  other than borrowings.  Floating rate debt bears interest based on the following benchmark rates: UK sterling US dollar Euro Euro Czech koruna Polish zloty Slovak koruna Nigerian naira 
 6 month LIBOR (London inter-bank offer rate)  6 month LIBOR (London inter-bank offer rate)  6 month LIBOR (London inter-bank offer rate)  6 month EURIBOR (European inter-bank offer rate)  3 month PRIBOR (Prague inter-bank offer rate)  6 month WIBOR (Warsaw inter-bank offer rate)  6 month BRIBOR (Bratislava inter-bank offer rate) month NIBOR (Nigerian inter-bank offer rate) 
The above analysis is shown after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.  
21.  Financial instruments Foreign currency transaction exposures The group has foreign exchange transaction exposures where subsidiaries hold monetary assets and liabilities which are not denominated in the functional currency of that subsidiary.  These exposures are primarily denominated in euros and US dollars.  Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of forward contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates at 31 December 2002 for contracts with similar maturity dates.  The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined as the difference in the present value of the future interest cash flows.  The fair value of commodities is based on independent quoted market valuations.  The fair value of options is based on Black-Scholes model and implied volatilities.  For primary financial instruments of cash,  deposits investments,  borrowings and other financial liabilities,  fair values equate to book values.  The group holds interest bearing borrowings at both fixed and floating interest rates.  However,  as indicated above,  interest rate swaps and options have been used to manage the group is exposure to interest rates,  in line with the group is fixed/floating rate strategy.  There is no difference between the book value and the fair value of debtors and creditors falling due within one year.  The group only uses derivatives for hedging purposes.  The following is a summary of the group is risk management strategies: Interest rate The fair value swap agreements utilised by the group effectively modify the group is exposure to interest rate risk and the changes in the fair value of debt by converting the group is fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on EURIBOR over the life of the underlying debt.  The agreements involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.  The group also uses cash flow interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the next five years,  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income.  
During 2002,  CCHBC purchased interest rate caps on floating rate debt.  The decision to purchase option caps versus using swaps was taken in order to continue benefiting from the lower floating interest rate environmentwhile having in place protection against adverse interest rate movements.  The options are marked to market with the gains and losses taken to the income statement.  The option premium is expensed in the income statement through the option revaluation process.  In 2002,  CCHBC benefited from lower interest costs andconsequently,  recognised a loss of f28m in relation to these items in the income statement.  Foreign currency The group is exposed to the effect of foreign currency risk on expenditures that are denominated in currencies other than the euro.  Forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures.  All of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.  Commodities The group is exposed to the effect of changes in the price of sugar.  To manage a portion of the price risk of sugar costs,  the group uses sugar future contracts traded on regulated futures exchanges.  The sugar future contracts entered into typically have maturities of up to 18 months after the balance sheet date.  The changes in market values of such contracts have historically been highly effective in offsetting sugar price fluctuations.  Credit risk exposure The group is maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail to perform their obligations at 31 December 2002 in relation to each class of recognised financial assets,  other than derivatives,  is the carrying amount of those assets as indicated in the balance sheet.  With respect to derivative financial instruments,  credit risk arises from the potential failure of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contract or arrangement.  The group is maximum credit risk exposure for each derivative instrument is as follows: 
Assets Liabilities p million p million As at 31 December 2002 Interest rate swaps Interest rate options Commodity future contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts

The total remuneration of directors paid during the year amounted to f22m (2001: f34m).  In addition to salary,  in 2002 the group provided non-cash benefits to the managing director and contributed to a postemployment pension plan on his behalf.  The managing director also participates in the group is stock option plans.  
23.  Equity compensation plan The group operates a stock purchase plan,  the Coca-Cola HBC Stock Purchase Plan,  which is an equity compensation plan that eligible employees can participate in.  Under the terms of this plan,  employees have the opportunity to invest 1% to 15% of their salary in ordinary CCHBC shares by contributing to the plan monthly.  CCHBC will match up to a maximum of 3% of the employees' salary by way of contribution.  Employer contributions are used to purchase matching shares on a monthly basis on the open market,  currently the Athens Stock Exchange,  by a trust,  The Coca-Cola HBC Employee Stock Purchase Trust.  Matching shares vest 350 days after the purchase.  However,  forfeited shares are held in a reserve account by the trust,  do not revert back to the company and may be used to reduce future employer contributions.  Dividends received in respect of shares held by the trust accrue to the employees.  In order to adapt the plan to the Greek legal framework in the case of employees resident in Greece,  we match our Greek resident employees' contribution up to a maximum of 5% of their salary with an annual employer contribution,  which we make in December,  and matching shares purchased in December vest immediately.  During 2002,  98679 shares were purchased by CCHBC (2001: 87926) as matching shares to employee investments.  The purchase cost,  expensed in the income statement as incurred,  totalled f15m (2001: f14m).  Of this amount,  f03m represented employer contributions made for Greek resident employees.  The fair value of unvested matching shares held by the trust at the end of 2002,  before they vest to employees,  was f12m (2001: f14m).  The total number of shares held by the trust at 31 December 2002 was 653398.  The total contribution made by employees to the trust during 2002 was f21m.  No provision is made for any increase or decrease in value of these shares,  as they will vest to employees,  and the risks and rewards of fluctuations of the share price are borne by those employees.  
24.  Employee stock option plan Senior executives are eligible to participate in the CCHBC stock option plan.  CCHBC uses the intrinsic value accounting method for the share awards under which there is no charge to earnings for employee stock option awards.  Options are granted at an exercise price of the average mid-price of the company is shares at close of trading on the Athens Stock Exchange over the last ten working days before the date of the grant.  Options vest in one-third increments each year for three years and can be exercised for up to ten years from the date of award.

Share Capital There is only one class of shares,  of which the par value is f031.  Each share provides the right to one vote at general meetings of the company and entitles the holder to dividends declared by the company.  The authorised share capital of CCHBC was increased by f24m at the Annual General Meeting of the company through an increase of par value of the shares from f030 per share to f031,  effective 27 June 2002.  The increase resulted in the capitalisation of a revaluation reserve of the company relating to the revaluation of land and buildings.  On 22 November 2001,  the authorised share capital of CCHBC was increased by f15m at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the company through an increase of the par value of the shares from 100 Greek drachma to 102225 Greek drachma which equates to f030.  The increase was necessary for the conversion of the share capital into euro,  as Greek law requires the minimum par value of the shares after conversion to be f030.  Share Premium The share premium reserve represents the excess over par value that shares were issued for.

The participation in shared marketing agreements are at TCCC is discretion and,  where co-operative arrangements are entered into,  marketing expenses are shared.  Such arrangements include the development of marketing programmes to promote TCCC beverages.  TCCC has also customarily made additional payments for marketing and advertising direct to suppliers as part of the shared marketing arrangements.  The proportion of direct and indirect payments,  made at TCCC is discretion,  will not necessarily be the same from year to year.

The Greek Competition Authority issued a decision on 25 January 2002,  imposing a fine on the company of approximately f29m and requiring changes in the company is commercial practices in respect of free on-loan coolers in certain outlets in Greece.  The fine relates to the company is commercial dealings with certain wholesalers during the period 1991-1999.  On 27 March 2002,  the company appealed this decision before the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal.  On 18 April 2002,  the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal accepted in part the company is interim application for suspension of the Greek Competition Authority is decision by suspending half of the amount of the fine imposed on the company by the Greek Competition Authority.  Until the main hearing before the Athens Court of Appeal,  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the case.  The European Commission is currently investigating commercial practices engaged in by CCHBC is subsidiary in Austria.  This forms part of a broader investigation of commercial practices of The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers in Europe.  The investigation commenced in July 1999 when the European Commission visited CCHBC is offices in Austria and London.  This investigation may lead to the institution of formal proceedings by the European Commission against CCHBC is Austrian subsidiary in the course of 2003.  In the absence of such proceedings,  it is not possible to quantify the likelihood or materiality of any potential fines or restrictions of our practices.  In recent years,  customs authorities in some Central and Eastern European countries have attempted to challenge the classification under which the group imports concentrate into these countries to produce our products.  Local authorities have argued that a classification with higher custom duties than the current classification should apply.  In 2001,  one such issue in Hungary was successfully resolved.  The group still has similar issues outstanding before the Polish and Romanian customs authorities.  At this time it is not possible to quantify the risk of a negative outcome in these cases.  There are no other material litigation issues pending against group companies.

Organisation Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.  ('CCHBC") is incorporated in Greece and was formed in August 2000 through the merger of Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.  ('HBC") and Coca-Cola Beverages plc ('CCB") (see Note 2).  CCHBC and its subsidiaries (collectively the 'Company") are principally engaged in the production and distribution of alcohol-free beverages under franchise from The Coca-Cola Company ('TCCC").  The Company distributes its products in Europe and Nigeria.  Information on the Company is operations by segment is included in Note 12.  CCHBC is listed on the Athens,  New York,  London and Sydney stock exchanges.  Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CCHBC and its subsidiaries (and include the accounts of Hellenic Bottling Company and its subsidiaries (the predecessor company) for the period prior to August 2000).  Investments in affiliates in which CCHBC has ownership interests of 20% to 50% are accounted for under the equity method.  Our investments in other companies are carried at cost or fair value,  as appropriate.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions,  including transactions with equity method investees,  are eliminated in consolidation.  The Company had a 60% ownership interest in Coca-Cola Molino Beverages Limited,  a company engaged in the bottling and distribution of TCCC beverages in Russia.  This investment was accounted for under the equity method becauseaccording to the shareholders' agreement between TCCC and the Company,  TCCC had substantive participating rights that required its approval for decisions occurring in the ordinary course of business.  These decisions included approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets as well as selection and termination of executive management.  On 23 November 2001,  the Company acquired the remaining 40% ownership from TCCC and the operations of Coca-Cola Molino Beverages Limited have been consolidated from that date.  Use of estimates In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,  the preparation of financial statements for the Company requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses,  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Although these estimates are based on management is knowledge of current events and actions that may be undertaken in the future,  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.  Revenue recognition Revenues are recognised when all of the following conditions are met: evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally,  purchase orders),  products have been delivered and there is no future performance required and amounts are collectible under normal payment terms.  Revenue is stated net of sales discounts,  listing fees and marketing and promotional incentives paid to customers.  Listing fees are incentives provided to customers for carrying the Company is products in their stores.  Fees that are subject to contractual-based term arrangements are amortised over the term of the contract.  The amount of listing fees so capitalised at 31 December 2002 was f58m (2001: f28m).  Of this balance,  f36m (2001: f07m) was classified as prepaid expenses (current) and the remainder as other non-current assets.  Listing fees expensed for the year ended 31 December 2002 amounted to f75m with f65m and f23m for 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Marketing and promotional incentives paid to customers during 2002 amounted to f880m with f379m in 2001,  and f226m in 2000.  We receive certain payments from TCCC in order to promote sales of Coca-Cola branded products.  Contributions for price support and marketing and promotional campaigns in respect of specific customers are recognised as an offset to promotional incentives paid to customers.  These reimbursements are accrued and matched to the expenditure with which they relate.  In 2002,  such contributions totalled f304m as compared to f499m and f350m in 2001 and 2000respectively.  Where we distribute third party products we recognise the related revenue earned based on the gross amount invoiced to the customer where we act as principal,  take title to the products and have assumed the risks and rewards of ownership.  We recognise revenue on the basis of the net amount retained (that is,  the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) where the Company acts as an agent without assuming the relevant risks and rewards.

Interest expense 
1.  Organisation and significant accounting policies (continued) Warehouse costs Warehouse costs represent the expenses associated with operating Company-owned or leased warehouse facilities used to store finished goods.  Warehousing costs are included in selling,  delivery and administrative expenses.  Such costs amounted to f1157m in 2002 with f1068m and f574m in 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Distribution costs Distribution costs represent those costs that are incurred to transport product to the buyer is designated location.  These costs include the fees charged by third party shipping agents and expenses incurred in running our own trucking fleet.  Distribution costs are included in selling,  delivery and administrative expenses.  In 2002,  the distribution costs totalled f1946m,  compared with f1720m and f947m for 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Advertising expense Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were f1059m in 2002 with f1248m and f666m during 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  
Interest costs are expensed as incurred and include interest on loans,  overdrafts,  capital leases and amortisation of debt issuance costs.  Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits.  Inventories Inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market value using principally the first in,  first-out method.  Property,  plant and equipment Property,  plant and equipment are initially stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.  The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings Leasehold buildings and improvements Returnable containers Production and other equipment 
40 years over the term of the lease,  up to 40 years 3 to 12 years 3 to 12 years 
Production and other equipment includes coolers used to distribute beverages for immediate consumption.  Depreciation includes amortisation of assets under capital leases.  Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of franchise rights,  goodwill and,  until 31 December 2001,  assembled workforce.  Franchise agreements contain performance requirements and convey to the franchisee the rights to distribute and sell products of the franchiser within designated territories over specified periods of time.  TCCC does not grant perpetual franchise rights outside of the United States.  The Company believes its franchise agreements will continue to be renewed at each expiration date and,  therefore,  essentially have an indefinite useful life.  In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.  142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ('Statement No.  142"),  goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (including franchise rights) are no longer amortised but are reviewed annually for impairment.  With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to 1 July 2001the Company began applying the new accounting rules beginning 1 January 2002.  For business combinations initiated after 30 June 2001,  the new accounting rules were applied from the acquisition date.  
Prior to the cessation of amortisation,  franchise rights and goodwill were amortised on a straight-line basis over 40 years,  and assembled workforce was amortised over five years.  The assembled workforce intangible asset was reclassified to goodwill upon adoption of Statement No.  142.  The adoption of Statement No.  142 required an initial impairment assessment to be performed on all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,  with an annual impairment assessment thereafter,  unless factors indicate that the test should be made earlier.  The Company tests for goodwill impairment using the two-step process described in Statement No.  142.  The first step is a screen for potential impairment,  while the second step measures the amount of impairment.  Fair values are derived using discounted cash flow analysis,  based on cash flow assumptions consistent with our internal planning,  discounted at rates reflecting market comparability adjusted to the Company is facts and circumstances.  The Company evaluates franchise rights for impairment by comparing its carrying value to its fair value determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows from such franchise rights.  Franchise incentive arrangements TCCC,  at its sole discretion,  provides the Company with various incentives,  including contributions toward the purchase of cold drink equipment.  Payments are received on placement of coolers and are based on franchise incentive arrangements and included as a reduction to the assets to which they relate.  The terms and conditions of these arrangements require reimbursement if certain conditions stipulated in the agreements are not met,  including principally minimum volume requirements.  Management believes the risk of reimbursement is remote.  Total support payments received from TCCC for the placement of cold drink equipment are f183m in 2002 (f24m in 2001).  No such payments were received in 2000.  Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No.  144Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ('Statement No.  144").  Statement No.  144 supercedes FASB Statement No.  121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,  and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No.  30,  Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business.  The Company adopted Statement No.  144 as of 1 January 2002.  The adoption of the standard has not had a significant impact.  The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets.  The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount.  Conditions that may indicate an impairment issue exists include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations.  In the event that a condition is identified that may indicate an impairment issue existsan assessment is performed using a variety of methodologies,  including cash flow analysis,  estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals.  Where applicable,  an appropriate discount rate is utilised,  based on location-specific economic factors.  Income taxes Income taxes have been provided using the liability method in accordance with FASB Statement No.  109,  Accounting for Income Taxes.  Recapitalisation The authorised share capital of CCHBC was increased by f24m at the 2002 Annual General meeting of the Company through an increase of the par value of the shares from f030 per share to f031 per share,  effective 27 June 2002.  The increase resulted from the capitalisation of retained earnings.  On 22 November 2001,  the authorised share capital of CCHBC was increased by f15m at an extraordinary general meeting of the Company through an increase of the par value of the shares from 100 Greek drachma to 102225 Greek drachma which equates to f030 per share.  The increase was necessary for the conversion of the share capital into euro,  as Greek law requires the minimum par value of the shares after conversion to be f030 per share.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.  Organisation and significant accounting policies (continued) Retained earnings Retained earnings include tax free,  partially taxed and statutory reserves particular to the various countries in which the Company operates.  Statutory reserves amounting to f313m cannot be distributed,  while tax free and partially taxed reserves amounting to f2166m may be distributed if taxed,  where applicable.  Foreign currency translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries operating in non hyper-inflationary countries have been translated into euro in accordance with FASB Statement No.  52,  Foreign Currency Translation ('Statement No.  52").  All balance sheet accounts have been translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Income statement amounts have been translated using the average monthly exchange rate.  The gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The subsidiaries in Belarus,  Moldova,  Romania,  Russia,  Serbia and Montenegro,  and Ukraine operate in hyper-inflationary environments.  The functional currency used to remeasure the financial statements of Serbia and Montenegro and the other countries are the euro and the U.S.  dollar,  respectively,  as in each case it is the currency most closely aligned to or used for the pricing,  payment or measurement of their revenues,  costs,  debt and trade liabilities.  Transactions and balances not already measured in U.S.  dollars or euros have been remeasured into U.S.  dollars or euros in accordance with the relevant provisions of Statement No.  52.  Accordingly,  revenues,  cost,  capital and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are remeasured at historical exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are remeasured at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.  Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in results of operations.  Transaction losses totalling f75m,  f51m and f145m were included in the statements of income for the years ended 31 December 2002,  2001 and 2000respectively.  The exchange rate between the euro and the Greek drachma was fixed at f1  34075 Greek drachmas effective 1 January 2001.  Accordingly,  the accounts of CCHBC included in the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2000 were translated at that fixed rate.  Derivative financial instruments As of 1 January 2001,  the Company adopted FASB Statement No.  133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  which was issued in June 1998,  and its amendments include: Statements No.  137,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.  133 and Statement No.  138,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,  issued in June 1999 and June 2000,  respectively (collectively referred to as 'Statement No.  133").  As a result of adoption of Statement No.  133,  the Company recognises all derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument.  Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognised periodically in income or in shareholders' equity as a component of comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting,  and if so,  whether it qualified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  Generally,  changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of the hedged items that related to the hedged risks.  Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges,  to the extent they qualify for hedge accounting,  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of deferred taxes.  Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in income.  Adoption of Statement No.  133 did not have a significant effect on the Company is financial statements other than recognition of derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet with market value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income.  Prior to 1 January 2001,  the Company also used derivative instruments.  The accounting policies followed for each was as follows: Interest rate swaps: Receipts and payments were included in interest expense.  Unrealised gains and losses were not recognised in income.  
Foreign currency contracts: Realised gains and losses were recognised in income during the same period as the underlying hedged item was recognised in income.  Gains or losses on contracts terminated early were recognised in income.  Commodity futures: Realised gains and losses were recognised in income during the same period as the underlying transaction.  Gains or losses on contracts terminated early were recognised in income immediately.  Stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock option grants to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.  25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related interpretations.  New accounting pronouncements In July 2002,  FASB issued Statement No.  146,  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ('Statement No.  146").  This statement requires that a liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activity be recognised,  and measured at fair value,  when the liability is incurred rather than at the date an entity commits to an exit plan.  This impacts on the recognition of one-time termination benefits such as severance pay and other termination indemnities where the benefit arranged requires employees to serve beyond the minimum retention period.  In such cases,  the cost of the one-time termination benefit are recognised at fair value over the term of the retention period.  Statement No.  146 also addresses accounting for other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity,  such as costs to consolidate or close functions and relocate employees.  A liability for such costs must be recognised and measured at its fair value in the period incurred.  In the case of contract termination costs such as operating leases,  a liability is recognised and measured at its fair value (less any economic benefit) when the entity terminates the contract.  The new standard is applicable for exit and disposal activity initiated after 31 December 2002.  This statement will impact the timing of the Company is recognition of liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.  In December 2002,  FASB issued Statement No.  148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure ('Statement No.  148").  Statement No.  148 amends Statement No.  123 to provide three alternative methods of transition for Statement No.  123 is fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation for companies that elect to adopt the provisions of Statement No.  123.  Transition to the fair value accounting method of Statement No.  123 is not required by Statement No.  148.  The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No.  25 and related interpretations.  Statement No.  148 also amends the disclosure provisions of Statement No.  123 to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity is accounting policy with respect to stock-based compensation.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement No.  123,  to stock-based employee compensation.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.  Organisation and significant accounting policies (continued) Emerging Issues Task Force ('EITF") Issue No.  02-16,  Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,  provides guidance on how a customer of a vendor is products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor.  Specifically,  cash consideraton received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor is products or services and should be characterised as a reduction of cost of sales when recognised in the customer is income statement.  This presumption is overcome when the consideration is either (a) a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor,  in which case the cash consideration should be characterised as revenue,  or (b) a reimbursement of costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendor is products,  in which case the cash consideration should be characterised as a reduction of the cost.  The EITF consensus is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2002.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this EITF on the financial statements.

Franchise rights,  goodwill and other intangible assets The adoption of Statement No.  142 required the Company to perform an initial impairment assessment on all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as at 1 January 2002.  The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an after-tax decrease to net income of f940m.  The deferred income tax benefit related to the cumulative effect of this change was f250m.  The impairment charges resulting in the after-tax decrease to net income for the cumulative effect of this change by applicable operating segment as at 1 January 2002 are as follows: p million Established countries Developing countries 
Total 
Of the f174m impairment for established countries,  f141m relates to franchise rights and f33m relates to goodwill.  The impairment arose mainly in Switzerland as a result of a reassessment of projections following lower than expected growth in the non-alcoholic beverages sector in the Swiss market.  Of the f766m impairment for the developing countries,  f493m relates to franchise rights and f273m relates to goodwill.  The impairment charge arose mainly in Poland as a result of a fall in growth expectations arising from a stagnant economic environment.  The Company also reclassified an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortised balance of f249m (together with the related deferred tax liability of f84m) to goodwill upon adoption of Statement No.  142.  The Company is franchise rights have an indefinite useful life.  Consequently,  no amortisation is recorded on these franchise rights from 1 January 2002.

In March 2002,  we established a f10 billion global commercial paper programme with various financial institutions to further diversify our short-term funding sources.  The programme consists of a multi-currency euro-commercial paper facility and a U.S.  dollar denominated U.S.  commercial paper facility.  The commercial paper notes may be issued either as non-interest bearing notes sold at a discount or as interest bearing notes at a fixed or at a floating rate,  or by reference to an index or formula.  All commercial paper issued under the programme must be repaid within 1 to 365 days.  During May 2002,  we replaced our f7500m syndicated loan facility with a f9000m facility issued through various financial institutions.  This facility will be used as a backstop to the f10 billion global commercial paper programme and carries a floating interest rate over EURIBOR and LIBOR.  The facility allows us to draw down,  on one to five days notice,  amounts in tranches and repay them in periods ranging from one to six months,  or any other period agreed between the financial institutions and us.  In the aggregate,  we have a maximum available borrowing under the global commercial paper programme and the backstop facility of f10 billion.  The use of the backstop facility may become subject to a covenant setting a minimum ratio of our COP to our consolidated net interest expense of at least 3:1 in the event that either our credit rating by Standard & Poors falls below BBB+ or our credit rating by Moody is does not remain at or above Baa1.  COP is defined as operating income (loss) before deductions for depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets.  Our current ratings are above those required and accordingly,  the Company is currently not subject to financial covenants.  As at 31 December 2002,  we exceeded the required minimum ratio of our COP to our consolidated net interest expense.  COP and net consolidated interest for this purpose are calculated pursuant to our financial statements as prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards.  No amounts have been drawn under this facility.  Short-term borrowings at 31 December consists of: 2002 p million

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 6.  Income taxes (continued) At 31 December 2002 the Company had net operating tax loss carryforwards (NOLs) of f3918m (2001: f4644m) for income tax purposes.  f1094m of NOLs expire between 2003 and 2007.  f63m of NOLs expire between 2008 and 2010.  f2761m of NOLs do not expire because they were generated in tax jurisdictions where NOLs do not have expiration dates.  For financial reporting purposes a valuation allowance of f230m (2001: f317m) has been recognised to offset a portion of the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards.  No income taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries where those earnings are considered to be permanently invested.  Total undistributed earnings in such foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately f7319m at 31 December 2002.  Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise,  the Company would be subject to Greek income taxes (net of foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.  Determination of the amount of unrecognised deferred income tax liabilities is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.  Total tax paid during the years ended 31 December 2002,  2001 and 2000 were f571m,  f416m and f424mrespectively.

Other The Greek Competition Authority issued a descision on 25 January 2002,  imposing a fine on the Company of approximately f29m and requiring changes in the Company is commercial practices in respect of free on-loan coolers in certain outlets in Greece.  The fine relates to the Company is commercial dealings with certain wholesalers during the period 1991-1999.  On 27 March 2002,  the Company appealed this decision before the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal.  On 18 April 2002 the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal accepted in part the Company is interim application for suspension of the Greek Competition Authority is decision by suspending half of the amount of the fine imposed on the Company by the Greek Competition Authority.  Until the main hearing before the Athens Court of Appeal,  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the case.  
The European Commission is currently investigating commercial practices engaged in by CCHBC is subsidiary in Austria.  This forms part of a broader investigation of commercial practices of TCCC and its bottlers in Europe.  The investigation commenced in July 1999 when the European Commision visited CCHBC is offices in Austria and London.  This investigation may lead to the institution of formal proceedings by the European Commission against CCHBC is Austrian subsidiary in the course of 2003.  In the absence of such proceedings,  it is not possible to quantify the likelihood or materiality of any potential fines or restrictions of our practices.  In recent years,  customs authorities in some Central and Eastern European countries have attempted to challenge the classification under which the group imports concentrate into these countries to produce our products.  Local authorities have argued that a classification with higher custom duties than the current classification should apply.  In 2001,  one such issue in Hungary was successfuly resolved.  The Company still has similar issues outstanding before Polish and Romanian Custom Authorities.  At this time,  it is not possible to quantify the risk of a negative outcome in these cases.  The Company is also involved in various other legal proceedings.  Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of these pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.  At 31 December 2002,  the Company had capital commitments over the next year of f704m.  At 31 December 2002,  the Company had commitments to purchase f1503m of raw materials over the next three years.  
11.  Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments The Company only uses derivatives for hedging purposes.  The following is a summary of the Company is risk management strategies and the effect of these strategies on the Company is consolidated financial statements.  Interest rate The Company used interest rate swap and option cap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure.  The swap agreements utilised by the Company effectively modify the Company is exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Company is f6250m and f3000m fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on EURIBOR.  The notional amount of the swaps is f9250m.  The agreements involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.  The Company also used interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its f2000m floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis over the remaining life of the debt,  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income.  Unrealised losses of f12m were recorded in other comprehensive income at year end,  which,  if realised,  will be recorded in interest expense over the life of the debt.  During year ended 31 December 2002,  the Company recognised a net gain of f65m (2001: net loss of f17m) related to the undesignated portion of its interest rate swaps.  In 2001 the Company also recognised losses of f64m during the year ended 31 December 2001,  related to cash flow hedges that had been discontinued because the underlying debt to which these hedges related was refinanced and replaced by new debt instruments.  Both amounts have been included in other income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended 31 December 2002 and 2001respectively.  During 2002,  the Company purchased interest rate caps on floating rate debt.  The decision to purchase options versus using swaps was taken in order to continue benefiting from the lower floating interest rate environment,  while having in place protection against adverse interest rate movements.  The options are marked to market with gains and losses taken to the statement of income.  The option premiums are expensed in the income statement through the option revaluation process.  In 2002,  the Company benefited from lower interest costs and,  consequently,  recognised a loss of f28m in relation to these items in the income statement.  The cumulative loss on these caps will not exceed the premiums paid of f49m.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 11.  Financial instruments (continued) Foreign currency The Company is exposed to the effect of foreign currency risk on expenditures that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation with the exposure.  From time to time,  the Company uses forward contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures.  All of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.  At 31 December 2002 and 2001,  the Company recorded a nominal amount of unrealised losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the hedge contracts,  which if realised,  will be recorded in operating expenses when the underlying transaction affects operating results.  The fair values of forward contracts,  f80m and negative f01m at 31 December 2002 and 2001 respectively,  are included in other current assets and other current liabilities.  Sugar The Company is exposed to the effect of changes in the price of sugar.  To manage a portion of the price risk of sugar costs,  the Company uses sugar future contracts traded on regulated futures exchanges.  The sugar future contracts entered into typically have maturities of up to 18 months after the balance sheet date.  The changes in market values of such contracts have historically been highly effective at offsetting sugar price fluctuations.  At 31 December 2002,  the Company recorded f27m of unrealised gains in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the hedge contracts,  which if realised,  will be recorded in cost of sales when the related sugar is utilised in 2003.  Concentration of credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash,  trade accounts receivable,  and derivatives.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions.  The financial institutions are located throughout the countries in which the Company operates.  It is the Company is policy to limit exposure to any one institution.  Concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Company is customer base.  Counterparties to derivative instruments expose the Company to credit risk in the event of non-performance.

The Company adopted an employee stock option plan on 13 December 2001.  Previously,  the Company had issued stock appreciation rights to certain of its employees,  including employees who previously held options in CCB.  Upon adoption of the stock option plan,  all such rights,  except those held by retirees and employees located in countries where granting and exercising stock options was impractical or not permitted,  were converted into stock options carrying over the same exercise prices,  vesting periods and expiration dates.  All other stock options were granted at exercise prices equal to the ten-day average price of CCHBC shares prior to the date of grant.  The CCHBC options vest over a three-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant.  At the date of the conversion to stock options,  13 December 2001,  there were 7201355 stock appreciation rights outstanding with exercise prices ranging from f1335 to f2506.  The holders of these rights would receive a payment equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market value of a CCHBC share at the date of exercise.  These rights have been accounted for as stock appreciation rights payable in cash,  and the Company recorded compensation expense of less than f01m for each of the years ended 31 December,  2001 and 2000.  The accrued liability at the date of conversion,  less than f01m,  was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.  The rights which were not converted to stock options on 13 December 2001,  1302267 in total,  have continued to be accounted for as stock appreciation rights payable in cash,  along with 738400 new stock appreciation rights issued on 11 December 2002 with an exercise price of f1431.  There was nominal compensation expense recognised for all the rights in 2002,  less than f 01m,  and there was no accrued liability associated with the rights outstanding at 31 December 2002,  1631828 in total.  The Company follows APB Opinion No.  25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ('APB Opinion No.  25"),  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans.  Under APB Opinion No.  25,  to the extent options are granted with an exercise price less than the market price on date of grant,  compensation expense is recognised over the vesting period.  Compensation expense recorded for 2002,  amounted to f03m.  There was no compensation expense recorded for 2001 and 2000.  Following is a summary of stock options outstanding as at 31 December 2002.  Range of exercise prices Number of options outstanding Weighted average remaining contractual life Weighted average exercise price Number of options exercisable Weighted average exercise price 
All of the above options were granted on 13 December 2001.  The Company had previously granted,  upon its acquisition of CCB,  2293049 stock options to former holders of CCB stock options.  These options were not exercised and expired six months after the date of grant and were then replaced with stock appreciation rights in quantities and prices in line with the previous stock options.  There were no other options granted,  exercised or forfeited during 2002,  2001 or 2000.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 13.  Stock-based compensation plans (continued) Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by Statement No.  123,  and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of the Statement.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options,  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.  Because the Company is employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options,  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,  in management is opinion,  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of it is employee stock options.  For purposes of pro forma disclosures,  the estimated fair value of the options is amortised to expense over the options' vesting period.  The Company is pro forma information for the three years ended 31 December 2002 is presented in Note 1 under the heading  New accounting pronouncements".

Summary of significant differences between accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements included in this section are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('US GAAP"),  which differ in certain respects from International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS").  Those differences that have a significant effect on our revenue,  net income and shareholders' equity are as follows: 
Sales revenue In accordance with US GAAP,  the Company classifies payments made to customers as a deduction from sales,  except where the Company receives an identifiable benefit in return for the expenditure,  the identifiable benefit is separable from the customer is purchase of CCHBC is products and CCHBC can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit.  For IFRS purposes,  payments made to customers that relate to marketing activities are classified as selling,  delivery and administrative expenses,  regardless of whether the Company is able to determine the fair value of the identifiable benefit received.  
Intangible assets The purchase price for the acquisition of Coca-Cola Beverages plc (CCB) in 2000 was considerably greater under US GAAP as the consideration was determined based upon the share prices at the date of the announcement of the acquisition in accordance with APB 16,  rather than the close date as required by IFRS.  This difference is reflected initially in intangible assets and equity.  In addition,  intangible assets arising on the acquisition of many entities have not been recognised under US GAAP since HBC and the entities concerned were under the common control of The Kar-Tess Group.  US GAAP requires the recognition of deferred tax on franchise agreements.  This further increases the goodwill recognised on acquisition under US GAAP.  For the purposes of IFRS,  the Company classifies franchise agreements acquired in business combination as goodwill.  As a result,  there is no related uplift in the deferred tax value.  Under IFRS,  the Company amortises goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets over a period of 20 years,  using the straight-line method.  For US GAAP purposes,  goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortised,  but are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with Statement No.  142.  The amortisation provisions of Statement No.  142 are applied to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after 30 June 2001.  With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to 1 July 2001,  the Company began applying the new accounting rules beginning 1 January 2002.  Previously under US GAAP the Company amortised goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets over a period of 40 years,  using the straight-line method.  The adoption of Statement No.  142 required CCHBC to perform an initial impairment assessment on all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of 1 January 2002.  The result was an impairment of f1190m,  offset by f250m of deferred tax.  No additional impairment was indicated by the assessment conducted at 31 December 2002.  
Equity accounting The Company is interest in a jointly controlled entity,  Brewinvest S. A.,  is accounted for under the equity method of accounting for US GAAP and under the proportional consolidation method of accounting for IFRS.  Prior to the acquisition of the remaining 40% ownership stake in Coca-Cola Molino Beverages Limited on 23 November 2001,  the Company is interest was accounted for under the equity method of accounting for US GAAP and under the proportional consolidation method of accounting for IFRS.  
Insurance proceeds For IFRS purposes,  insurance proceeds on certain product contamination claims have been treated as income in 2000 and 2001,  whilst for US GAAP they were treated as an adjustment to the fair values recognised on the acquisition of CCB.  
Under US GAAP,  revaluations of property,  plant and equipment are not permitted.  IFRS,  however,  allows for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.  Any surplus or deficit (to the extent that the revaluation reserve is in surplus) on the revaluation is taken directly to the shareholders' equity.  As a result,  the reconciliation reflects the revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation adjusted accordingly.  
Deferred tax The US GAAP treatment of deferred tax is different in a number of respects from IFRS.  The issues of importance for CCHBC are a different approach to calculating and recognising deferred tax for entities operating in hyper-inflationary environments and the subsequent recognition of deferred tax assets existing at the time of acquisition.  
Employee entitlements There are a number of differences in the treatment of employee entitlements,  in particular in relation to the treatment of pensions,  stock options,  stock appreciation rights and the employee share ownership plan.
