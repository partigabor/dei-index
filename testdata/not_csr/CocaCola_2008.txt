We were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.  Our Company is one of numerous competitors in the commercial beverages market.  Of the approximately 54 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day,  beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for approximately 16 billion.

Products and Distribution Our Company manufactures and sells beverage concentrates,  sometimes referred to as ''beverage bases, ' and syrups,  including fountain syrups,  and finished beverages.  As used in this report:  ''concentrates' means flavoring ingredients and,  depending on the product,  sweeteners used to prepare syrups or finished beverages;  ' isyrups' means the beverage ingredients produced by combining concentrates and,  depending on the product,  sweeteners and added water;  ''fountain syrups' means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers,  such as restaurants,  that use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;  ' isparkling beverages' means nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages with carbonation,  including energy drinks and carbonated waters and flavored waters;  ' istill beverages' means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation,  including noncarbonated watersflavored waters and enhanced waters,  juices and juice drinks,  teas,  coffees and sports drinks; and  ''Company Trademark Beverages' means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverage products licensed to us for which we provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit.  
We sell the concentrates and syrups for bottled and canned beverages to authorized bottling and canning operations.  In addition to concentrates and syrups for sparkling beverages and flavored still beverages,  we also sell concentrates (in powder form) for purified water products such as Dasani to authorized bottling operations.  Authorized bottlers and canners either combine our syrups with sparkling water or combine our concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product),  still water and/or sparkling water to produce finished sparkling beverages.  The finished sparkling beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us—such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles (''bottle/can products')—and are then sold to retailers (''bottle/can retailers') or,  in some cases,  wholesalers.  For our fountain products in the United States,  we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to authorized fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers.  The wholesalers are authorized to sell the Company is fountain syrups by a nonexclusive appointment from us that neither restricts us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restricts the territory in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States.  Outside the United States,  fountain syrups typically are manufactured by authorized bottlers from concentrates sold to them by the Company.  The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers.  Finished beverages manufactured by us include a variety of sparkling and still beverages.  We sell these beverages to authorized bottlers or distributors,  wholesalers or directly to retailers.

In addition,  in the United States we market Nestea and Enviga products under a sublicense agreement with a subsidiary of Nestlé S. A.  (' Nestlé').  Multon,  a Russian juice business (''Multon') operated as a joint venture with Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.

Consumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings.  Consumer demand can vary from one locale to another and can change over time within a single locale.  Employing our business strategy,  and with special focus on core brands,  our Company seeks to build its existing brands and,  at the same time,  to broaden its historical family of brands,  products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand locale by locale.  During 2008,  we expanded our still beverage offerings by acquiring from Carlsberg Group Beverages (''Carlsberg') the mineral water brands Kildevaeld and Kurvand in Denmark and entering into a license agreement regarding mineral water brand Ramlosa in Denmark.  As a part of this same transaction,  the Company also expanded its sparkling beverage offerings by acquiring from Carlsberg the soft drink brand Hyvaa Paivaa in Finland and entering into a license agreement regarding the energy drink Battery in Finland.  Also,  in October 2008,  we entered into agreements for the distribution of Monster Energy trademark beveragesincluding Monster Energy,  Java Monster and Lost Energy,  in portions of 21 states in the United States,  Canada and six Western European countries.  In addition,  during 2008,  our Company introduced a variety of new brandsbrand extensions and new beverage products.  Among numerous examples,  in North America,  we launched Powerade Zero in Mixed Berry,  Strawberry and Grape flavors,  Simply Orange with Mango,  Simply Orange with Pineapple,  Odwalla Mojito Mambo natural juice drink and Odwalla Pomegranate Strawberry,  both sweetened with Truvia brand sweetener,  a natural sweetener made with rebiana,  which is derived from the stevia plant,  and Sprite Green,  a new reduced calorie Sprite line extension,  sweetened with Truvia.  In Latin America,  we launched Gladiator energy drink,  Aquarius sparkling flavored water,  del Valle juice and glacéau vitaminwater.  In Europenew launches included Coca-Cola Light Plus Lemon,  Coca-Cola Light with Green Tea and The Spirit of Georgia—Blood Orange Prickly Pear.  In Africa,  we launched Schweppes Novida and Aquarius.  In Japan,  we launched Hajime Chaka,  Aquarius Zero,  Georgia Emerald Mountain Blend Black and Fanta Zero Lemon.  Our Company measures the volume of products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales.  As used in this report,  ''unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S.  fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings); and ''unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners (the ''Coca-Cola system') to customers.  Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks.  Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to,  or distributed by,  our Company,  and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit.  Such products licensed to,  or distributed by,  our Company or owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume.  In addition,  unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest.  Although most of our Company is revenues are not based directly on unit case volume,  we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level.  The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors.  Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates,  syrups,  beverage bases and powders (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by,  or used in finished beverages sold by,  the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.  Most of our revenues are based on concentrate sales,  a primarily wholesale activity.  Unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.  Factors such as seasonality,  bottlers' inventory practices,  supply point changes,  timing of price increases,  new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates.  In addition to the items mentioned above,  the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures,  in which the Company has an equity interest,  but to which the Company does not sell concentrates,  may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates.  
In 2008,  concentrates and syrups for beverages bearing the trademark ''Coca-Cola' or any trademark that includes ''Coca-Cola' or ''Coke' (''Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages') accounted for approximately 52 percent of the Company is total concentrate sales.  In 2008,  concentrate sales in the United States (''U.S.  concentrate sales') represented approximately 23 percent of the Company is worldwide concentrate sales.  Approximately 56 percent of U.S.  concentrate sales for 2008 was attributable to sales of beverage concentrates and syrups to 74 authorized bottler ownership groups in 393 licensed territories.  Those bottlers prepare and sell Company Trademark Beverages for the food store and vending machine distribution channels and for other distribution channels supplying products for home and immediate consumption.  Approximately 32 percent of 2008 U.S.  concentrate sales was attributable to fountain syrups sold to fountain retailers and to 470 authorized fountain wholesalers,  some of which are authorized bottlers.  The remaining approximately 12 percent of 2008 U.S.  concentrate sales was attributable to sales by the Company of finished beverages,  including juice and juice-drink products and certain water products.  Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.,  including its bottling subsidiaries and divisions (''CCE'),  accounted for approximately 42 percent of the Company is U.S.  concentrate sales in 2008.  At December 31,  2008,  our Company held an ownership interest of approximately 35 percent in CCE,  which is the world is largest bottler of Company Trademark Beverages.  In 2008,  concentrate sales outside the United States represented approximately 77 percent of the Company is worldwide concentrate sales.  The countries outside the United States in which our concentrate sales were the largest in 2008 were Mexico,  Brazil,  China and Japan,  which together accounted for approximately 29 percent of our worldwide concentrate sales.  Approximately 89 percent of non-U.S.  unit case volume for 2008 was attributable to sales of beverage concentrates and syrups to authorized bottlers together with sales by the Company of finished beverages,  other than juice and juice-drink products,  in 442 licensed territories.  Approximately 5 percent of 2008 non-U.S.  unit case volume was attributable to fountain syrups.  The remaining approximately 6 percent of 2008 non-U.S.  unit case volume was attributable to juice and juice-drink products.  In addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities,  we may provide promotional and marketing services or funds to our bottlers.  In most cases,  we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements,  even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottling or distribution agreements between our Company and the bottlers.  Also,  on a discretionary basis in most cases,  our Company may develop and introduce new products,  packages and equipment to assist its bottlers.  Likewise,  in many instances,  we provide promotional and marketing services and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers,  typically pursuant to marketing agreements.  The aggregate amount of funds provided by our Company to bottlers,  resellers or other customers of our Company is products,  principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs,  was approximately $44 billion in 2008.  Bottler is Agreements and Distribution Agreements Most of our products are manufactured and sold by our bottling partners.  We typically sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners,  who convert them into finished packaged products which they sell to distributors and other customers.  Separate contracts (''Bottler is Agreements') exist between our Company and each of our bottling partners regarding the manufacture and sale of Company products.  Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations,  the Bottler is Agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare specified Company Trademark Beverages,  to package the same in authorized containers,  and to distribute and sell the same in (but,  subject to applicable local law,  generally only in) an identified territory.  The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers.  We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributingor from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute,  the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers; however,  we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside 
the territory,  and (2) to prepare,  package,  distribute and sell such beverages in the territory in any other manner or form.  Territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law.  Being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers.  Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.  The Bottler is Agreements between us and our authorized bottlers in the United States differ in certain respects from those in the other countries in which Company Trademark Beverages are sold.  As further discussed below,  the principal differences involve the duration of the agreements; the inclusion or exclusion of canned beverage production rights; the inclusion or exclusion of authorizations to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups; in some cases,  the degree of flexibility on the part of the Company to determine the pricing of syrups and concentrates; and the extent,  if any,  of the Company is obligation to provide marketing support.  Outside the United States The Bottler is Agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration,  subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals of the term of the contract.  Generallythese contracts are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events.  These events include defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottler.  In certain parts of the world outside the United States,  we have not granted comprehensive beverage production rights to the bottlers.  In such instances,  we or our authorized suppliers sell Company Trademark Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout the designated territory,  often on a nonexclusive basis.  A majority of the Bottler is Agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups,  usually on a nonexclusive basis.  Our Company generally has complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to bottlers outside the United States.  In some instances,  however,  we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods.  Outside the United States,  in most cases,  we have no obligation to provide marketing support to the bottlers.  Nevertheless,  we may,  at our discretion,  contribute toward bottler expenditures for advertising and marketing.  We may also elect to undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities.  Within the United States In the United States,  with certain very limited exceptions,  the Bottler is Agreements for Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and other cola-flavored beverages have no stated expiration date.  Our standard contracts for other sparkling beverage flavors and for still beverages are of stated duration,  subject to bottler renewal rights.  The Bottler is Agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.  The ''1987 Contract, ' described below,  is terminable by the Company upon the occurrence of certain events,  including:  the bottler is insolvency,  dissolution,  receivership or the like;  any disposition by the bottler or any of its subsidiaries of any voting securities of any bottler subsidiary without the consent of the Company;  any material breach of any obligation of the bottler under the 1987 Contract; or  except in the case of certain bottlers,  if a person or affiliated group acquires or obtains any right to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of any class or series of voting securities of the bottler without authorization by the Company.  
Under the terms of the Bottler is Agreements,  bottlers in the United States are authorized to manufacture and distribute Company Trademark Beverages in bottles and cans.  However,  these bottlers generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups.  Rather,  as described above,  our Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers.  These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups or deliver them on our behalf to restaurants and other retailers.  In the United States,  the form of Bottler is Agreement for cola-flavored sparkling beverages that covers the largest amount of U.S.  concentrate sales (the ''1987 Contract') gives us complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups for Company Trademark Beverages.  In some instanceswe have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods.  Bottlers operating under the 1987 Contract accounted for approximately 944 percent of our Company is total U.S.  concentrate sales for bottled and canned beverages in 2008,  excluding direct sales by the Company of juice and juice-drink products and other finished beverages (''U.S.  bottle/can concentrate sales').  Certain other forms of U.S.  Bottler is Agreements,  entered into prior to 1987,  provide for concentrates or syrups for certain Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages to be priced pursuant to a stated formula.  Bottlers accounting for approximately 53 percent of U.S.  bottle/can concentrate sales in 2008 have contracts for certain Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages with pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price.  This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company,  up to a maximum indexed ceiling price,  and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices,  as applicable.  Bottlers accounting for the remaining approximately 03 percent of U.S.  bottle/can concentrate sales in 2008 operate under our oldest form of contract,  which provides for a fixed price for Coca-Cola syrup used in bottles and cans.  This price is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the quoted price of sugar.  We have standard contracts with bottlers in the United States for the sale of concentrates and syrups for non-cola-flavored sparkling beverages and certain still beverages in bottles and cans,  and,  in certain cases,  for the sale of finished still beverages in bottles and cans.  All of these standard contracts give the Company complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale.  Under the 1987 Contract and most of our other standard beverage contracts with bottlers in the United States,  our Company has no obligation to participate with bottlers in expenditures for advertising and marketing.  Nevertheless,  at our discretion,  we may contribute toward such expenditures and undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities.  Some U.S.  Bottler is Agreements that predate the 1987 Contract impose certain marketing obligations on us with respect to certain Company Trademark Beverages.  As a practical matter,  our Company is ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of its syrups,  concentrates and finished beverages under various agreements described above is subject,  both outside and within the United States,  to competitive market conditions.  Significant Equity Method Investments and Company Bottling Operations Our Company maintains business relationships with three types of bottlers:  bottlers in which the Company has no ownership interest;  bottlers in which the Company has invested and has a noncontrolling ownership interest; and  bottlers in which the Company has invested and has a controlling ownership interest.  In 2008,  bottling operations in which we had no ownership interest produced and distributed approximately 24 percent of our worldwide unit case volume.  We have equity positions in 43 unconsolidated bottling,  canning and distribution operations for our products worldwide.  These cost or equity method investees produced and distributed approximately 54 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2008.  Controlled and consolidated 
bottling operations produced and distributed approximately 11 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2008.  The remaining approximately 11 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2008 was produced by our fountain operations and our juice and juice drink,  sports drink and other finished beverage operations.  We make equity investments in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system is production,  distribution and marketing capabilities around the world.  These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume,  net revenues and profits at the bottler level,  which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our Company is concentrate and syrup business.  When this occurs,  both we and our bottling partners benefit from long-term growth in volume,  improved cash flows and increased shareowner value.  The level of our investment generally depends on the bottler is capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment.  Historically,  in certain situations,  we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation,  often on a temporary basis.  Owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler is sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler is business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures.  In line with our long-term bottling strategy,  we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler.  One such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances.  Another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity method investee bottlers.  In both of these situations,  our Company continues to participate in the bottler is results of operations through our share of the strategic business alliances' or equity method investees' earnings or losses.  In cases where our investments in bottlers represent noncontrolling interests,  our intention is to provide expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses.  Significant investees in which we have noncontrolling ownership interests include the following: Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  (''CCE').  Our ownership interest in CCE was approximately 35 percent at December 31,  2008.  CCE is the world is largest bottler of the Company is beverage products.  In 2008,  sales of concentrates,  syrups,  mineral waters,  juices,  sweeteners and finished products by the Company to CCE were approximately $68 billion.  CCE estimates that the territories in which it markets beverage products to retailers (which include portions of 46 states and the District of Columbia in the United States,  the U.S.  Virgin Islands and certain other Caribbean islands,  Canada,  Great Britain,  continental France,  the Netherlands,  LuxembourgBelgium and Monaco) contain approximately 78 percent of the United States population,  98 percent of the population of Canada,  and 100 percent of the populations of Great Britain,  continental France,  the NetherlandsLuxembourg,  Belgium and Monaco.  In 2008,  CCE is net operating revenues were approximately $218 billion.

Seasonality Sales of our ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal,  with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes.  The volume of sales in the beverages business may be affected by weather conditions.  Competition Our Company competes in the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry.  The nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry is highly competitive,  consisting of numerous firms.  These include firms that,  like our Company,  compete in multiple geographic areas,  as well as firms that are primarily regional or local in operation.  Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling beverages; various water products,  including packaged,  flavored and enhanced waters; juices and nectars; fruit drinks and dilutables (including syrups and powdered drinks); coffees and teas; energy and sports and other performance-enhancing drinks; dairy-based drinks; functional beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages.  These competitive beverages are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and other than ready-to-drink form.  In many of the countries in which we do business,  including the United StatesPepsiCo,  Inc.  is one of our primary competitors.  Other significant competitors include,  but are not limited toNestlé,  Dr Pepper Snapple Group,  Inc.,  Groupe Danone,  Kraft Foods Inc.  and Unilever.  We also compete against numerous regional and local firms in various geographic areas in which we operate.  
Competitive factors impacting our business include,  but are not limited to,  pricing,  advertising,  sales promotion programs,  product innovation,  increased efficiency in production techniques,  the introduction of new packaging,  new vending and dispensing equipment,  and brand and trademark development and protection.  Our competitive strengths include leading brands with a high level of consumer acceptance; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated associates.  Our competitive challenges include strong competition in all geographic regions and,  in many countries,  a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products,  products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store-brand beverages.  Raw Materials The principal raw materials used by our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners.  In the United States,  the principal nutritive sweetener is high fructose corn syrup,  a form of sugar,  which is available from numerous domestic sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price.  The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose,  another form of sugar,  which is also available from numerous sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price.  Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners.  In the United States,  we purchase high fructose corn syrup to meet our and our bottlers' requirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers' Sales & Services Company LLC (''CCBSS').  CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States.  Among other things,  CCBSS provides procurement services to our Company for the purchase of various goods and services in the United States,  including high fructose corn syrup.  The principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame,  acesulfame potassiumsaccharin,  cyclamate and sucralose.  Generally,  these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources.  However,  our Company purchases aspartame,  an important non-nutritive sweetener that is used alone or in combination with other important non-nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin or acesulfame potassium in our low-calorie sparkling beverage products,  primarily from The NutraSweet Company and Ajinomoto Co.,  Inc, which we consider to be our primary sources for the supply of this product.  We currently purchase acesulfame potassium from Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH,  which we consider to be our primary source for the supply of this product.  Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners.  Our Company sells a number of products sweetened with sucralose,  a non-nutritive sweetener.  We work closely with Tate & Lyle,  our sucralose supplier,  to maintain continuity of supply.  Although Tate & Lyle is our single source for sucralose,  we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining our requirements for sucralose.  With regard to juice and juice-drink products,  citrus fruit,  particularly orange juice concentrate,  is our principal raw material.  The citrus industry is subject to the variability of weather conditions.  In particularfreezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice concentrate throughout the industry.  Due to our ability to also source orange juice concentrate from the Southern Hemisphere (particularly from Brazil),  we normally have an adequate supply of orange juice concentrate that meets our Company is standards.  Patents,  Copyrights,  Trade Secrets and Trademarks Our Company owns numerous patents,  copyrights and trade secrets,  as well as substantial know-how and technology,  which we collectively refer to in this report as ''technology. ' This technology generally relates to our Company is products and the processes for their production; the packages used for our products; the design and operation of various processes and equipment used in our business; and certain quality assurance software.  Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties.  Our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulae are among the important trade secrets of our Company.  
We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business.  Depending upon the jurisdictiontrademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.  Pursuant to our Bottler is Agreements,  we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their manufacture,  sale and distribution of Company products.  In addition,  we grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.  Governmental Regulation Our Company is required to comply,  and it is our policy to comply,  with applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us,  and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  The production,  distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Company is products are subject to the Federal Food,  Drug,  and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; federal,  state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal,  state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal,  state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production,  transportation,  sale,  safety,  advertising,  labeling and ingredients of such products.  Outside the United States,  the production,  distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.  A California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because it recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required.  Consequently,  even trace amounts of listed components can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label.  Products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement.  No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law.  We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might in the future be added to the California lists pursuant to this law and the related regulations as they currently exist,  or as they may be amended.  The state has,  however,  initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated for listing.  Furthermore,  we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a Company beverage produced for sale in California.  Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable,  recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world.  Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers,  which are also recyclable.  Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale,  marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers.  The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary.  Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits,  recycling,  ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas.  We anticipate that additional,  similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local,  state and federal levels,  both in the United States and elsewhere.  All of our Company is facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations,  including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater.  Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements.  Compliance with these provisions has not had,  and we do not expect such compliance to have,  any material adverse effect on our Company is capital expenditures,  net income or competitive position.  
Employees We refer to our employees as ''associates. ' As of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  our Company had approximately 92400 and 90500 associates,  respectively,  of which approximately 16500 and 16000,  respectivelywere employed by entities that we have consolidated under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (''FASB') Interpretation No.  46 (revised December 2003),  ''Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities' (''Interpretation No.  46(R)').  The increase in the total number of associates in 2008 was primarily due to an increase in bottling operations activity,  partially offset by a decrease resulting from the sale of certain bottling operations.  At the end of 2008 and 2007,  our Company had approximately 13000 and 13200 associates,  respectively,  located in the United States,  of which approximately 85 and 1300,  respectively,  were employed by entities that we have consolidated under Interpretation No.  46(R).  Our Company,  through its divisions and subsidiaries,  has entered into numerous collective bargaining agreements.  We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.  The Company believes that its relations with its associates are generally satisfactory.  Securities Exchange Act Reports The Company maintains a website at the following address: www, thecoca-colacompany, com.  The information on the Company is website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.  We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ''SEC') in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended (the ''Exchange Act').  These include our annual reports on Form 10-K,  our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K.  We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with,  or furnish it to,  the SEC.  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report,  you should carefully consider the following factors,  which could materially affect our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our businessfinancial condition or results of operations.  Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.  Consumers,  public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity,  particularly among young people.  In addition,  some researchers,  health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of certain types of beverages,  especially sugar-sweetened beverages.  Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the marketing,  labeling or availability of our beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing,  labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for our beverages,  which could affect our profitability.  Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system is production costs and capacity.  Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products.  It is also a limited resource in many parts of the world,  facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation,  increasing pollution,  poor management and climate change.  As demand for water continues to increase around the world,  and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates,  our system may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.  12 
Changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment could impact our financial results.  The nonalcoholic beverages business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of,  among other thingschanges in consumer preferences,  including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures.  In addition,  the industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel,  particularly in Europe and the United States.  If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment,  our net income,  share of sales and volume growth could be negatively affected.  The global credit crisis may adversely affect our liquidity and financial performance.  The global credit markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions in recent months.  If the current credit crisis were to worsen,  we may be unable to access credit markets on favorable terms,  which could increase our cost of borrowing.  In addition,  the current credit crisis may make it more difficult for our bottling partners to access financing on terms comparable to those obtained historically,  which would affect the Coca-Cola system is profitability as well as our share of the income of bottling partners in which we have equity method investments.  The current global credit market conditions and their actual or perceived effects on our and our major bottling partners' results of operations and financial condition,  along with the deteriorating economic environment brought about by the financial crisis,  may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings,  which could have a negative effect on our borrowing costs.  The significant decline in the equity markets and in the valuation of other assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system instability has affected the value of our pension plan assets.  The lower pension plan asset base will negatively affect our return on plan assets and thus increase our pension expense.  In addition,  if the current adverse market conditions continue for a prolonged period of time or deteriorate further,  it could have an additional negative impact on our future pension benefit expense.  As a result of the decline in the fair value of our pension plans assets and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension benefit obligations,  we have made and will consider making additional contributions to our U.S.  and international pension plans in 2009.  In addition,  the instability of major financial institutions caused by the credit crisis could increase the counterparty risk associated with our existing derivative financial instruments and may increase the cost of,  or may impair our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for,  future derivative transactions.  The decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from the financial crisis,  as well as general unfavorable economic conditions,  may also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending,  which would reduce the demand for our beverages and negatively affect our net revenues and the Coca-Cola system is profitability.  Increased competition could hurt our business.  The nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry is highly competitive.  We compete with major international beverage companies that,  like our Company,  operate in multiple geographic areas,  as well as numerous firms that are primarily local in operation.  In many countries in which we do businessincluding the United States,  PepsiCo,  Inc.  is a primary competitor.  Other significant competitors include,  but are not limited to,  Nestlé,  Dr Pepper Snapple Group,  Inc.,  Groupe Danone,  Kraft Foods Inc.  and Unilever.  In addition,  in certain markets,  our competition includes major beer companies.  Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors.  If we are unable to expand our operations in developing and emerging markets,  our growth rate could be negatively affected.  Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets,  which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities,  distribution networks,  sales equipment and technology.  Moreover,  the supply of our products in 
developing and emerging markets must match consumers' demand for those products.  Due to product pricelimited purchasing power and cultural differences,  there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular developing or emerging market.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues,  pay expenses,  own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S.  dollar,  including the euro,  the Japanese yen,  the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso.  In 2008,  we used 69 functional currencies in addition to the U.S.  dollar and derived approximately 75 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside of the United States.  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.  dollars,  we must translate revenues,  income and expenses,  as well as assets and liabilities,  into U.S.  dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period.  Therefore,  increases or decreases in the value of the U.S.  dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenuesoperating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.  Because of the geographic diversity of our operations,  weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time.  We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations.  However,  we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,  particularly the strengthening of the U.S.  dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries,  would not materially affect our financial results.  If interest rates increase,  our net income could be negatively affected.  We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows,  interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital.  We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital,  which increases our return on shareowners' equity.  This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates.  When appropriate,  we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks.  We cannot assure you,  however,  that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.  Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.  In assessing our credit strengthcredit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the aggregate balance sheet and other financial information for the Company and certain major bottlers.  It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology.  If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottlers' financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies' perception of the impact of the current credit crisis on our or our major bottlers' current or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason,  our cost of borrowing could increase.  Additionally,  if the credit ratings of certain bottlers in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded,  such bottlers' interest expense could increase,  which would reduce our equity income.  We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business.  If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners,  our business could suffer.  We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to bottling partners in which we do not have any ownership interest or in which we have a noncontrolling ownership interest.  In 2008,  approximately 78 percent of our worldwide unit case volume was produced and distributed by bottling partners in which the Company did not have controlling interests.  As independent companies,  our bottling partners,  some of which are publicly traded companies,  make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests.  In addition,  many of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies.  If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottling partners through a combination of pricing and marketing and advertising support,  they may take actions that,  while maximizing their own short-term profitsmay be detrimental to our Company or our brands,  or they may devote more of their energy and resources to 
business opportunities or products other than those of the Company.  Such actions could,  in the long run,  have an adverse effect on our profitability.  In addition,  the loss of one or more major customers by one of our major bottling partners,  or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes,  work stoppages or labor unrest affecting such bottling partners,  could indirectly affect our results.  If our bottling partners' financial condition deteriorates,  our business and financial results could be affected.  We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners and,  therefore,  the success of our business depends on our bottling partners' financial strength and profitability.  While under our bottling partners' agreements we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and syrups,  our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers.  In addition,  we have investments in certain of our bottling partners,  which we account for under the equity methodand our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss.  Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our controlincluding competitive and general market conditions in the territories in which they operate and the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms.  A deterioration of our bottling partners' financial condition or results of operations because of adverse competitive,  general economic or capital market conditions,  or due to other unfavorable developments,  could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; could result in a decrease in our equity income from equity-method investments; and could negatively affect the carrying values of such investments,  resulting in asset write-offs.  If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms,  or we or our bottling partners experience strikes,  work stoppages or labor unrest,  our business could suffer.  Many of our associates at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  If we are unable to renew such agreements on satisfactory terms,  our labor costs could increase,  which would affect our profit margins.  In addition,  many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions.  Strikes,  work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers,  which would reduce our revenues and could expose us to customer claims.  Increase in the cost,  disruption of supply or shortage of energy could affect our profitability.  Our Company-owned bottling operations and our bottling partners operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles.  In addition,  we and our bottlers use a significant amount of electricity,  natural gas and other energy sources to operate our concentrate and bottling plants.  An increase in the price,  disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources that may be caused by increasing demand or by events such as natural disasters,  power outages or the like would increase our and the Coca-Cola system is operating costs andtherefore,  could negatively impact our profitability.  Increase in cost,  disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients or packaging materials could harm our business.  We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business,  including high fructose corn syrupsucrose,  aspartame,  saccharin,  acesulfame potassium,  sucralose,  ascorbic acid,  citric acid,  phosphoric acid and orange juice concentrate,  as well as packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET or plastic) for bottles and aluminum for cans.  The prices for these ingredients and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions.  Substantial increases in the prices for our or our bottling partners' ingredients and packaging materials,  to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage productswould increase our and the Coca-Cola system is operating costs and could reduce our profitability.  Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from higher ingredient and packaging material costs could affect 
affordability in some markets and reduce Coca-Cola system sales.  In addition,  some of these ingredients,  such as aspartame,  acesulfame potassium,  sucralose,  saccharin and ascorbic acid,  as well as some of the packaging containers,  such as aluminum cans,  are available from a limited number of suppliers.  We cannot assure you that we and our bottling partners will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers.  An increase in the cost,  a sustained interruption in the supply,  or a shortage of some of these ingredients,  packaging materials or cans and other containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters,  power outages,  labor strikes or the like,  could negatively impact our net revenues and profits.  Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.  We and our bottlers currently offer nonrefillable,  recyclable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world.  Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale,  marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers.  Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits,  recyclingecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas,  and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local,  state and federal levels,  both in the United States and elsewhere.  Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations.  If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in any of the major markets in which we operate,  they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model,  which could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability.  In addition,  containerdeposit laws,  or regulations that impose additional burdens on retailers,  could cause a shift away from our products to retailer-proprietary brands,  which could impact the demand for our products in the affected markets.  Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.  Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the chemical content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of our products.  These types of requirements,  if they become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations,  may inhibit sales of such products.  One such law is in effect in California.  It requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  This law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required.  Pursuant to this law,  the State of California has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated for listing.  If a component found in one of our products,  such as caffeine,  is added to the lists pursuant to this law and related regulations as they currently exist or as they may be amended,  or if the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become available results in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in one of our beverages produced for sale in California,  the resulting warning requirements or adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales.  Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States or in other major markets could negatively impact our financial performance.  Unfavorable general economic conditions,  such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets,  could negatively affect the affordability of,  and consumer demand for,  some of our beverages.  Under difficult economic conditions,  consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies.  Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the United States or in other major markets could reduce the Coca-Cola system is profitability and could negatively affect our financial performance.  
Recent developments indicate that the United States economy is in recession and that the global economy is experiencing a slowdown.  If current adverse economic conditions were to continue or to worsen,  our results of operations could suffer.  Unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business.  We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets.  In 2008,  our operations outside of the United States accounted for approximately 75 percent of our net operating revenues.  Unfavorable economic and political conditions in certain of our international marketsincluding civil unrest and governmental changes,  could undermine consumer confidence and reduce the consumers' purchasing power,  thereby reducing demand for our products.  In addition,  product boycotts resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products,  while restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders which may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability could impact our profitability.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,  the current unstable economic and political conditions and civil unrest and political activism in the Middle EastIndia or the Philippines,  the unstable situation in Iraq,  or the continuation or escalation of terrorist activities could adversely impact our international business.  Changes in commercial and market practices within the European Economic Area may affect the sales of our products.  We and our bottlers are subject to an Undertaking,  rendered legally binding in June 2005 by a decision of the European Commission,  pursuant to which we committed to make certain changes in our commercial and market practices in the European Economic Area Member States.  The Undertaking potentially applies in 27 countries and in all channels of distribution where certain of our sparkling beverages account for over 40 percent of national sales and twice the nearest competitor is share.  The commitments we and our bottlers made in the Undertaking relate broadly to exclusivity,  percentage-based purchasing commitments,  transparency,  target rebates,  tying,  assortment or range commitments,  and agreements concerning products of other suppliers.  The Undertaking also applies to shelf space commitments in agreements with take-home customers and to financing and availability agreements in the on-premise channel.  In addition,  the Undertaking includes commitments that are applicable to commercial arrangements concerning the installation and use of technical equipment (such as coolers,  fountain equipment and vending machines).  Adjustments to our business model in the European Economic Area Member States as a result of these commitments or of future interpretations of European Union competition laws and regulations could adversely affect our sales in the European Economic Area markets.  Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.  We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.  We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate,  if possible,  the amount of potential losses.  Based on these assessments and estimates,  we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings,  as appropriate.  These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment.  We caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates.  In addition,  we have bottling and other business operations in emerging or developing markets with high-risk legal compliance environments.  Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our associates and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations,  including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials.  Nonetheless,  we cannot assure you that our policies,  procedures and related training programs will always ensure full compliance by our associates and agents with all applicable legal requirements.  Improper conduct by our associates or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings 
that could result in civil or criminal penalties,  including substantial monetary fines,  as well as disgorgement of profits.  Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.  The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate.  Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales,  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.  If we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation,  our business may suffer.  Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions.  We cannot assure you,  however,  that additional expenditures and our continuing commitment to advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences.  Changes in consumers' media preferences,  such as the shift away from traditional mass media to the Internet,  may undermine the effectiveness of our media advertising campaigns in reaching consumers and may increase our marketing costs.  Product quality issuesactual or perceived,  or allegations of product contamination,  even when false or unfounded,  could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products.  Allegations of product contamination,  even if untrue,  may require us from time to time to recall a beverage or other product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed.  Product recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image.  Also,  adverse publicity surrounding obesity concerns,  water usage,  labor relations and the like,  and campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues,  water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in certain developing countries in which we operate,  could negatively affect our Company is overall reputation and our products' acceptance by consumers.  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.  Our Company is business is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business,  including laws and regulations relating to competition,  product safetyadvertising and labeling,  container deposits,  recycling or stewardship,  the protection of the environment,  and employment and labor practices.  In the United States,  the production,  distribution and sale of many of our products are subject to,  among others,  the Federal Food,  Drug,  and Cosmetic Act,  the Federal Trade Commission Act,  the Lanham Act,  state consumer protection laws,  the Occupational Safety and Health Actvarious environmental statutes,  as well as various state and local statutes and regulations.  Outside the United States,  the production,  distribution,  sale,  advertising and labeling of many of our products are also subject to various laws and regulations.  Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereofincluding increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change,  may result in increased compliance costs,  capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners,  which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products,  which could affect our net operating revenues.  Changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements could affect our financial results.  New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our Company from time to time,  or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements,  could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods.  We are also subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which we generate net operating revenues.  In addition,  our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate.  Increases in income tax rates could 
reduce our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions,  while increases in indirect taxes could affect our products' affordability and therefore reduce demand for our products.  If we are not able to achieve our overall long-term goals,  the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.  We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives.  These objectives were based on our evaluation of our growth prospects,  which are generally based on volume and sales potential of many product types,  some of which are more profitable than others,  and on an assessment of a potential level or mix of product sales.  There can be no assurance that we will achieve the required volume or revenue growth or the mix of products necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption,  cyber-based attacks or network security breaches,  our operations could be disrupted.  We rely on information technology networks and systems,  including the Internet,  to process,  transmit and store electronic information.  In particular,  we depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our bottlers and other customers and suppliers.  Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions,  shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  If we are unable to prevent such breaches,  our operations could be disrupted,  or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.  We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.  We assess our goodwill,  trademarks and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired.  In 2008,  we recorded charges of approximately $16 billion to equity income,  which represented our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by CCE.  In addition,  the Company recorded a charge of approximately $81 million related to other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain available-for-sale securities.  In 2007,  we recorded net charges of approximately $150 million related to our proportionate share of impairment and restructuring charges partially offset by our proportionate share of tax rate changes recorded by certain equity investees.  In 2006,  we recorded a charge of approximately $602 million to equity income resulting from the impact of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by CCE,  and impairment charges of approximately $41 million primarily related to trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines and Indonesia.  Refer to the heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets' of ''Item 7.  Management is Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report for additional discussion of impairment charges.  If we do not successfully manage our Company-owned bottling operations,  our results could suffer.  While we primarily manufacture,  market and sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners,  from time to time we do acquire or take control of bottling operations and have increasingly done so in recent years.  As of December 31,  2008,  the net operating revenues generated by Company-owned and controlled bottling operations (which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment) represented approximately 27 percent of our Company is consolidated net operating revenues.  Often,  though not always,  these acquired bottling operations are in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance.  Acquisitions and consolidation of controlled bottling operations during 2008 and 2007 have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of Company-owned bottling plants included in our consolidated financial statements and in the number of our associates.  We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring,  taking control of or managing bottling operations and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in restructuring and integrating them into our Company is operating and 
internal control structures.  We may also experience delays in extending our Company is internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired bottling operations which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in such operations' financial records.  In addition,  our financial performance and the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system depend in part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of Company-owned or controlled bottling operations.  We cannot assure you,  however,  that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations.  Climate change may negatively affect our business.  There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters.  Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities,  such as sugar cane,  corn,  beets,  citrus,  coffee and tea,  which are important ingredients for our products.  Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities,  disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products.  Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regionswhich could limit water availability for our system is bottling operations.  In addition,  public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy,  transportation and raw material costs and may require us and our bottling partners to make additional investments in facilities and equipment.  As a result,  the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results.  Because of our global presence and worldwide operations,  our business can be affected by large-scale terrorist acts,  especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; major natural disasters; or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (generally known as SARS).  Such events could impair our ability to manage our business around the world,  could disrupt our supply of raw materials,  and could impact production,  transportation and delivery of concentrates,  syrups and finished products.  In additionsuch events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity,  which can affect consumers' purchasing power in the affected areas and,  therefore,  reduce demand for our products.  ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.  ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES Our worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre office complex in Atlanta,  Georgia.  The complex includes the approximately 621000 square foot headquarters building,  the approximately 870000 square foot Coca-Cola North America (''CCNA') building and the approximately 264000 square foot Coca-Cola Plaza building.  The complex also includes several other buildings,  including technical and engineering facilities,  a learning center and a reception center.  Our Company leases approximately 250000 square feet of office space at 10 Glenlake Parkway,  Atlanta,  Georgia,  which we currently sublease to third parties.  In addition,  we lease approximately 218000 square feet of office space at Northridge Business Park,  Dunwoody,  Georgia.  We own or lease additional real estate,  including a Company-owned office and retail building at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York,  New York.  These properties are primarily included in the Corporate operating segment.  The Company has facilities for administrative operations,  manufacturing,  processing,  packaging,  packingstorage and warehousing throughout the United States and Canada,  including a portion of the Atlanta office complex,  which are included in our North America operating segment.  In addition,  in North America,  we own 20 
nine still beverage production facilities and four bottled water facilities,  lease one bottled water facility,  and own a facility that manufactures juice concentrates for foodservice use,  all of which are included in the North America operating segment.  We own or hold a majority interest in or otherwise consolidate under applicable accounting rules bottling operations that own 118 principal beverage bottling and canning plants located throughout the world.  These plants are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment.  We own a facility in Brussels,  Belgium,  which consists of approximately 315000 square feet of office and technical space.  This facility is included in the Europe operating segment.  We also own or lease real estateoffice space and other facilities throughout the world which are used for administrative facilities,  warehouses and retail operations.  In addition,  as of December 31,  2008,  our Company owned and operated 29 principal beverage concentrate and/or syrup manufacturing plants located throughout the world.  These properties are generally included in the geographic operating segment in which they are located.  Management believes that our Company is facilities for the production of our products are suitable and adequate,  that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past experience,  and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes.  The extent of utilization of such facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products.  However,  management believes that additional production can be obtained at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment and,  at some facilities,  by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities.  We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and,  on the basis of that review,  may from time to time acquire additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in various legal proceedings,  including the proceedings specifically discussed below.  Management of the Company believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.  Carpenters On October 27,  2000,  a class action lawsuit (Carpenters Health & Welfare Fund of Philadelphia & Vicinity v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al. ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleging that the Company,  M.  Douglas Ivester,  Jack L.  Stahl and James E.  Chestnut violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making misrepresentations or material omissions relating to the Company is financial condition and prospects in late 1999 and early 2000.  A second,  largely identical lawsuit (Gaetan LaValla v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al. ) was filed in the same court on November 9,  2000.  The complaints allege that the Company and the individual named officers: (1) forced certain Coca-Cola system bottlers to accept ''excessive,  unwanted and unneeded' sales of concentrate during the third and fourth quarters of 1999,  thus creating a misleading sense of improvement in our Company is performance in those quarters; (2) failed to write down the value of impaired assets in Russia,  Japan and elsewhere on a timely basis,  again resulting in the presentation of misleading interim financial results in the third and fourth quarters of 1999; and (3) misrepresented the reasons for Mr.  Ivester is departure from the Company and then misleadingly reassured the financial community that there would be no changes in the Company is core business strategy or financial outlook following that departure.  Damages in an unspecified amount were sought in both complaints.  On January 8,  2001,  an order was entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia consolidating the two cases for all purposes.  The Court also ordered the plaintiffs to file a Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On July 25,  2001,  the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint,  which largely repeated the allegations made in the original complaints and added Douglas N.  Daft as an additional defendant.  
On September 25,  2001,  the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss all counts of the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On August 20,  2002,  the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' Motion to Dismiss.  The Court also granted the plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint.  On September 4,  2002,  the defendants filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Court is August 20,  2002 ruling.  The motion was denied by the Court on April 15,  2003.  On June 2,  2003,  the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint.  The defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on June 30,  2003.  On March 31,  2004,  the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint.  In its order,  the Court dismissed a number of the plaintiffs' allegations,  including the claim that the Company made knowingly false statements to financial analysts.  The Court permitted the remainder of the allegations to proceed to discovery.  The Court denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to further amend and replead their complaint.  The fact discovery closed on March 23,  2007,  pursuant to the Court is order.  However,  there remained certain unresolved issues relating to discovery pending before the Court.  In August 2007,  the Court heard oral argument on plaintiffs' motion to certify the class and the Company is opposition thereto.  In October 2007,  the Company filed various motions for summary judgment and related relief.  On May 23,  2008,  the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter for approximately $138 million,  with full releases and no admission of wrongdoing by the Company or the individual parties to the litigation.  On May 26,  2008,  the final settlement agreement was signed by the parties and the agreement was filed with the Court for approval on July 3,  2008.  On October 20,  2008,  the Court entered its final order approving the settlement.  The settlement amount was covered by insurance and,  therefore,  the settlement had no impact on the Company is consolidated financial statements.  This matter is now considered closed.  Aqua-Chem Litigation On December 20,  2002,  the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v.  Aqua-Chem,  Inc.,  Civil Action No.  2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court,  Fulton County,  Georgia (the ''Georgia Case'),  seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary,  Aqua-Chem,  Inc.,  now known as Cleaver-Brooks,  Inc.  (''Aqua-Chem'),  for any past,  present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem.  Subsequent to the Company is filing but on the same dayAqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem,  Inc.  v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  Civil Action No.  02CV012179) in the Circuit Court,  Civil Division of Milwaukee County,  Wisconsin (the ''Wisconsin Case').  In the Wisconsin CaseAqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem is general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company is sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981,  and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims.  The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed,  pending final resolution of the Georgia Case,  and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.  The Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981.  During that time,  the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage,  of which approximately $350 million is still available to cover Aqua-Chem is costs for certain product liability and other claims.  The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding,  Inc.  in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement.  The 1981 agreement,  and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement,  outlined the parties' rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem.  Cleaver-Brooks,  a division of Aqua-Chem,  manufactured boilers,  some of which contained asbestos gaskets.  Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has more than 100000 claims pending against it.  The parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26,  2004.  In the coverage action,  five plaintiff insurance 
companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company,  et al.  v.  Aqua-Chem,  Inc.,  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al.,  Case No.  04CV002852) in the Circuit Court,  Civil Division of Milwaukee County,  Wisconsin,  against the CompanyAqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies.  Several of the policies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem.  The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem.  The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations.  Two of the insurers,  one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit,  asserted cross-claims against the Companyalleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem is asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.  Aqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally liable for coverage amounts,  but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply.  During the course of the Wisconsin coverage litigation,  Aqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers,  including plaintiffs,  who have paid or will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem.  On July 24,  2007,  the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers,  which judgment was not appealed.  The judgment directs,  among other things,  that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem is losses up to policy limits.  The court is judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.  The Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.  European Union Parallel Trade Matter The Company has had discussions with the Competition Directorate of the European Commission (the ''European Commission') about issues relating to parallel trade within the European Union arising out of comments received by the European Commission from third parties.  The Company has fully cooperated with the European Commission and has provided information on these issues and the measures taken and to be taken to address them.  The Company is unable to predict at this time with any reasonable degree of certainty what action,  if anythe European Commission will take with respect to these issues.  Chapman On June 30,  2005,  Maryann Chapman filed a purported shareholder derivative action (Chapman v.  Isdell,  et al. ) in the Superior Court of Fulton County,  Georgia,  alleging violations of state law by certain individual current and former members of the Board of Directors of the Company and senior management,  including breaches of fiduciary duties,  abuse of control,  gross mismanagement,  waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichmentbetween January 2003 and the date of filing of the complaint that have caused substantial losses to the Company and other damages,  such as to its reputation and goodwill.  The defendants named in the lawsuit include Neville Isdell,  Douglas Daft,  Gary Fayard,  Ronald Allen,  Cathleen Black,  Warren Buffett,  Herbert Allen,  Barry DillerDonald McHenry,  Sam Nunn,  James Robinson,  Peter Ueberroth,  James Williams,  Donald Keough,  Maria Lagomasino,  Pedro Reinhard,  Robert Nardelli and Susan Bennett King.  The Company is also named a nominal defendant.  The complaint further alleges that the September 2004 earnings warning issued by the Company resulted from factors known by the individual defendants as early as January 2003 that were not adequately disclosed to the investing public until the earnings warning.  The factors cited in the complaint include (i) a flawed business strategy and a business model that was not working; (ii) a workforce so depleted by layoffs that it was unable to properly react to changing market conditions; (iii) impaired relationships with key bottlers; and 
(iv) the fact that the foregoing conditions would lead to diminished earnings.  The plaintiff,  purportedly on behalf of the Company,  seeks damages in an unspecified amount,  extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief,  restitution and disgorgement of profits,  reimbursement for costs and disbursements of the action,  and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  The Company is motion to dismiss the complaint and the plaintiff is response were filed and fully briefed.  The Court heard oral argument on the Company is motion to dismiss on June 6,  2006.  Following the hearing,  the Court took the matter under advisement and the parties are awaiting a ruling.  There were no material developments in this case during 2008.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its interests in this matter.  CCE Shareholders Litigation In February 2006,  the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,  a purported shareholder of CCE,  filed a derivative suit (International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al. ) in the Delaware Court of Chancery for New Castle County naming the Company and current and former CCE board membersincluding certain current and former Company officers who serve or served on CCE is board,  as defendants.  The plaintiff alleged that the Company breached fiduciary duties owed to CCE shareholders based upon alleged control of CCE by the Company.  The complaint also alleged that the Company had actual control over CCE and that the Company abused its control by maximizing its own financial condition at the expense of CCE is financial condition.  Subsequently,  two lawsuits virtually identical to Teamsters were filed in the same court: Lang v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al.,  filed March 30,  2006,  and Gordon v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al.,  filed April 102006.  On April 6,  2006,  the Company moved to dismiss Teamsters or,  in the alternative,  for a stay of discovery.  On May 19,  2006,  the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating Teamsters,  Lang and Gordon under the caption In re Coca-Cola Enterprises,  Inc.  Shareholders Litigation and requiring the plaintiffs to file an amended consolidated complaint in the consolidated action as soon as practicable.  On September 29,  2006,  plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Shareholders' Derivative Complaint (the ''Amended Complaint').  The Amended Complaint omits certain former Company officers from the group of individual defendants and defines the ' arelevant time period' for purposes of the claims as October 15,  2003through the date of the filing.  The original complaint did not identify any specific dates.  The Amended Complaint also includes additional allegations about the conduct of the Company and certain of its executive officers,  including new allegations about the Company is purported control over CCE and allegations of improper conduct in connection with the establishment of a warehouse delivery system to supply Powerade to a major customer.  On December 7,  2006,  the Company filed its motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint and accompanying brief.  The plaintiffs' reply brief was filed on January 22,  2007.  On October 17,  2007,  the Chancery Court dismissed plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.  The plaintiffs appealed the Chancery Court is decision to the Delaware Supreme Court.  On June 20,  2008,  the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Chancery Court is decision,  thereby concluding the case.  American Canyon Matter The Company received notices of violations from local environmental authorities alleging that certain violations of the United States Clean Water Act (the ''CWA') and applicable local law occurred at the Company is production plant in American Canyon,  California.  That plant treats and discharges wastewater under permit authority issued under the CWA and local law.  The alleged violations related to handling of wastewater discharge and required regulatory reporting.  The Company cooperated with the local environmental authorities and reached a negotiated settlement under which it did not admit to any wrongdoing or fault but agreed to pay restitution and civil penalties.  The settlement amount was not material to the Company is business or financial condition.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.

Except to the extent that differences among our operating segments are material to an understanding of our business as a whole,  we present the discussion in the MD&A on a consolidated basis.   Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position—an analysis of cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations; foreign exchange; an overview of financial position; and the impact of inflation and changing prices.  Our Business General We are the largest manufacturer,  distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in the world.  Along with Coca-Cola,  which is recognized as the world is most valuable brand,  we market four of the world is top five nonalcoholic sparkling brands,  including Diet Coke,  Fanta and Sprite.  Our Company owns or licenses nearly 500 brands,  including diet and light beverages,  waters,  enhanced waters,  juices and juice drinks,  teas,  coffees,  and energy and sports drinks.  Through the world is largest beverage distribution systemconsumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the Company is beverages at a rate of approximately 16 billion servings each day.  Our Company generates revenues,  income and cash flows by selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as finished beverages.  We generally sell these products to bottling and canning operationsfountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers,  and,  in the case of finished products,  to distributors.  Our bottlers sell our branded products to businesses and institutions including retail chains,  supermarketsrestaurants,  small neighborhood grocers,  sports and entertainment venues,  and schools and colleges.  We continue to expand our marketing presence and increase our unit case volume in developed,  developing and emerging markets.  Our strong and stable system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing,  distributing and marketing existing,  enhanced and new innovative products to our consumers throughout the world.  While we primarily manufacture,  market and sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners,  from time to time we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation,  often on a temporary basis.  Often,  though not always,  these acquired bottling operations are in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance.  Owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler is sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler is business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures.  Acquisitions and consolidation of controlled bottling 
operations during 2008 and 2007 have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of Company-owned bottling plants included in our consolidated financial statements and in the number of our associates.  In 2008net operating revenues generated by Company-owned and consolidated bottling operations (which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment) represented approximately 27 percent of our Company is consolidated net operating revenues and distributed approximately 11 percent of our worldwide unit case volume.  We have three types of bottling relationships: bottlers in which our Company has no ownership interestbottlers in which our Company has a noncontrolling ownership interest and bottlers in which our Company has a controlling ownership interest.  We authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates and syrups into branded finished products that they then distribute and sell.  In 2008bottling partners in which our Company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest produced and distributed approximately 78 percent of our worldwide unit case volume.  We make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands,  including expenditures for advertising,  sponsorship fees and special promotional events.  As part of our marketing activities,  we,  at our discretion,  provide retailers and distributors with promotions and point-of-sale displays; our bottling partners with advertising support and funds designated for the purchase of cold-drink equipment; and our consumers with coupons,  discounts and promotional incentives.  These marketing expenditures help to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands.  We believe that greater awareness and preference promote long-term growth in unit case volume,  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales.  The Nonalcoholic Beverages Segment of the Commercial Beverages Industry We operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry.  We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies.  We,  along with other beverage companies,  are affected by a number of factors,  including,  but not limited to,  cost to manufacture and distribute products,  consumer spending,  economic conditions,  availability and quality of waterconsumer preferences,  inflation,  political climate,  local and national laws and regulations,  foreign currency exchange fluctuations,  fuel prices and weather patterns.  Our Objective Our objective is to use our formidable assets—brands,  financial strength,  unrivaled distribution systemglobal reach,  and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide—to achieve long-term sustainable growth.  Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following:  People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be.   Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people is desires and needs.   Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty.   Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference.   Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities.   Productivity: Managing our people,  time and money for greatest effectiveness.  Strategic Priorities We have four strategic priorities designed to create long-term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca-Cola system and value for our shareowners.  These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca-Cola 
system for growth.  To enable the entire Coca-Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities,  we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; and franchise leadership.  Core Capabilities Consumer Marketing Marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands.  This produces long-term growth in unit case volume,  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales.  Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace,  we create and implement integrated marketing programs,  both globally and locally,  that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands.  In developing a strategy for a Company brand,  we conduct product and packaging research,  establish brand positioning,  develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback.  Our integrated marketing activities includebut are not limited to,  advertising,  point-of-sale merchandising and sales promotions.  We have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets,  increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets.  In emerging markets,  we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers.  In developing markets,  where consumer access has largely been established,  our focus is on differentiating our brands.  In our most developed markets,  we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs,  but at a slower rate than revenue growth.  We are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment.  Commercial Leadership The Coca-Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers.  We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses.  Our approach includes understanding each customer is business and needs,  whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market.  We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company.  We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences,  product availability and delivery systems,  and beverage merchandising and displays.  We participate in joint brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands.  Through our commercial leadership initiatives,  we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point-of-sale.  Franchise Leadership We must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values,  aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes.  The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Company is success.  We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies,  and we share best practices throughout the bottling system.  Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins.  With our bottling partners,  we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers.  We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these 
beverages with our bottling partners.  We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca-Cola system to gain a competitive advantage.  Challenges and Risks Being a global company provides unique opportunities for our Company.  Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities.  Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our Company.  Of these,  four key challenges and risks are discussed below.  Obesity and Inactive Lifestyles.  Increasing concern among consumers,  public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry.  We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem.  Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line,  which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages,  juices and juice drinks,  sports drinks and water products.  Our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovationchoice and variety.  We are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments,  educators and consumers through science-based solutions and programs.  Water Quality and Quantity.  Water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Company is attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry,  governments,  nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate.  Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products.  It is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation,  increasing pollution and poor management.  Our Company is in an excellent position to share the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve—water-resource management,  water treatment,  wastewater treatment systems,  and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs.  We are actively engaged in assessing the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program.  We are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects.  We are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system.  As demand for water continues to increase around the world,  we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource.  Evolving Consumer Preferences.  Consumers want more choices.  We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs,  on-the-go lifestyles,  aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever.  We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products.  We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs,  desires and lifestyle choices.  Increased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace.  Our Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and many local participants.  We must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share.  All four of these challenges and risks—obesity and inactive lifestyles,  water quality and quantity,  evolving consumer preferences,  and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace—have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however,  we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,  which require management to make estimates,  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets  Revenue Recognition  Income Taxes  Contingencies Management has discussed the development,  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company is Board of Directors.  While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future,  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.  For a discussion of the Company is significant accounting policies,  refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary.  Our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our Company is level of involvement in setting up the entity,  determining if the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on behalf of our Company,  determining whether the Company provides more than half of the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity is expected losses or returns.  We use the equity method to account for investments in companies,  if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee.  Our consolidated net income includes our Company is proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies.  Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest,  representation on the board of directors,  participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.  We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method,  as applicable.  Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value,  if the fair value of the security is readily determinable as defined by and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (''SFAS') No.  115,  ''Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. ' Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income.  Unrealized gains and losses,  net of deferred taxes,  on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (''AOCI').  Trading securities are reported as marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets.  Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets,  depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment.  The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option as permitted by SFAS 
No.  159,  ''The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.  115, ' which provides entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting,  or for which the Company has not elected the fair value option,  are accounted for under the cost method.  In accordance with the cost method,  our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared.  Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets.  Our Company eliminates all significant intercompany transactions,  including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees,  from our financial results.  Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets Management is assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates.  These estimates require significant management judgment,  include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore,  they do not change in isolation.  Factors that management must estimate include,  among others,  the economic life of the asset,  sales volume,  prices,  inflation,  cost of capitalmarketing spending,  foreign currency exchange rates,  tax rates and capital spending.  These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile.  The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  The estimates we use when performing impairment tests are management is best assumptions that a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.  Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors.  The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions,  including uncertainty about future events,  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period.  If other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period,  impairment charges could have resulted.  As mentioned above,  these factors do not change in isolation; and therefore,  it is not practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor.  Furthermore,  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods,  future impairment charges could result.  Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic,  political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate,  particularly in developing or emerging markets.  Refer to the heading ''Our Business—Challenges and Risks, ' above,  and ''Item 1A.  Risk Factors' in Part I of this report.  As a result,  management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.  We perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  For certain assets,  recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For other assetsimpairment tests are required at least annually,  or more frequently,  if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.  Investments in Equity and Debt Securities The carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method or the cost method,  or at fair value.  Refer to the heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Basis of Presentation and Consolidation, ' above.  Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value.  Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity.  Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value,  and classified as either trading or available-for-sale.  
The following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): Carrying Value 
Percentage of Total Assets 
Equity method investments Securities classified as available-for-sale Cost method investments Securities classified as held-to-maturity Securities classified as trading 
Total 
* Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Company is total assets.  
Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment,  since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income.  We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment.  When such events or changes occur,  we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment.  We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period.  The fair values of most of our Company is investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices.  For investments in nonpublicly traded companiesmanagement is assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flowsestimates of sales proceeds and appraisals,  as appropriate.  We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.  The ability to accurately predict future cash flows,  especially in developing and emerging markets,  may impact the determination of fair value.  In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis,  management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.  If management determines the decline is other than temporary,  an impairment charge is recorded.  Management is assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on,  among other things,  the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis,  the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  
The following table presents the difference between calculated fair values,  based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares,  and our Company is cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): Fair Value

Carrying Value 
Difference 
The carrying value of our investment in CCE was reduced to zero as of December 31,  2008,  primarily as a result of recording our proportionate share of impairment charges and items impacting AOCI recorded by CCE.  
The carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Embonor S. A.  exceeded its fair value as of December 31,  2008.  Management has concluded that this decline in fair value is temporary in nature.  
The carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic has exceeded its fair value in each of the last three months of 2008; however,  the amount by which our carrying value has exceeded its fair value has decreased in each of those three months.  As is the case with most of our equity method investees,  we have both the ability and intent to hold our investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic as a long-term investment.  Furthermore,  under the terms of a shareholders agreement between the Company and another significant shareholder of Coca-Cola Hellenic,  the Company is required,  unless both parties agree to the contrary,  to maintain no less than a 20 percent ownership interest in Coca-Cola Hellenic through at least December 31,  2018.  Additionally,  we believe that the countries in which Coca-Cola Hellenic has bottling and distribution rights,  through direct ownership or joint ventures,  have positive growth opportunities.  We also believe that the recent volatility of Coca-Cola Hellenic is fair value is at least partly attributable to the volatility in the global financial markets and not necessarily indicative of a change in long-term value.  Based on these factors,  management has concluded that the decline in fair value of our investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic is temporary in nature.  We will continue to monitor our investments in future periods.  As of December 31,  2008,  the Company had several investments classified as available-for-sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment,  each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2008.  Management assessed each individual investment to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary.  Based on these assessmentsmanagement determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary based on a number of factors,  including,  but not limited to,  uncertainty regarding our intent to hold certain of these investments for a period of time that would be sufficient to recover our cost basis in the event of a market recovery; the fact that the fair value of each investment has continued to decline since the time that our cost basis initially exceeded its fair value; and the Company is uncertainty around the near-term prospects for certain of the investments.  As a result of the other-than-temporary decline in fair value of these investments,  the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately $81 million during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Certain of these investments are classified as marketable securities,  while others are classified as other investments in the consolidated balance sheets.  These impairment charges were recorded to other income (loss)—net in the consolidated statement of income.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Other Income (Loss)—Net, ' and Note 10 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Other Assets Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.  Additionally,  our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited.  Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights.  Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  As of December 31,  2008,  the carrying value of these assets was approximately $1733 million,  or 4 percent of our total assets.  When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable,  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  Property,  Plant and Equipment As of December 31,  2008,  the carrying value of our property,  plant and equipment,  net of depreciation,  was approximately $8326 million,  or 21 percent of our total assets.  Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property,  plant and equipment should be assessedincluding,  among others,  a significant decrease in market value,  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market,  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.  When such events or changes in circumstances are present,  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property,  plant and equipment,  including appraisals and discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  In 2007,  our Company recorded a charge of approximately $99 million in equity income (loss)—net.  This charge was primarily related to our proportionate share of asset impairments recorded by Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines,  Inc.  (''CCBPI') due to excess and obsolete bottles and cases.  These charges impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Equity Income (Loss)—Net, ' and Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Goodwill,  Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No.  142,  ''Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, ' classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill.  For intangible assets with definite lives,  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill,  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.  Our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of intangible assets and/or goodwill.  If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees,  the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge.  However,  the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences,  deferred taxes and deferred gains.  
The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Carrying Value 
Percentage of Total Assets 
Trademarks with indefinite lives Goodwill Bottlers' franchise rights Definite-lived intangible assets,  net Other intangible assets not subject to amortization 
Total 
* Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Company is total assets.  
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable,  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets,  including discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives,  including trademarks,  franchise rights and goodwill,  for impairment annually,  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.  We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets,  including,  but not limited to,  discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  For indefinite-lived intangible assetsother than goodwill,  if the fair value is less than the carrying amount,  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level,  which is one level below our operating segments.  The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process,  if necessary.  The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value,  including goodwill.  We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit.  The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value,  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss,  if any.  The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill,  which is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.  Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment,  primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition.  Consequently,  if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition,  it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets.  A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models,  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses,  includingbut not limited to,  the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.  Additionally,  as discussed above,  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,  we are required to ensure that 
assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.  As a result,  the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends,  regardless of whether our Company is actual cost of capital has changed.  Therefore,  our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts.  The Company has acquired significant intangible assets in the past several years through asset acquisitions and business combinations,  including,  among others,  the acquisition of brands and licenses in Denmark and Finland from Carlsberg; 18 German bottling and distribution operations; Energy Brands Inc.,  also known as glacéau; CCBPI; and Kerry Beverages Limited,  which was subsequently renamed Coca-Cola China Industries Limited (''CCCIL').  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about recently acquired intangible assets.  As of our most recent annual SFAS No.  142 impairment review,  the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets,  individually or in the aggregate.  However,  if macroeconomic conditions continue to worsen,  it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets,  which would require us to recognize impairment charges.  Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods.  As mentioned above,  the Company is required to record its proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by our equity method investees.  In 2008,  we recorded our proportionate share of approximately $76 billion pretax ($49 billion after-tax) of charges recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2008.  The Company is proportionate share of these charges was approximately $16 billion.  The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE is North American franchise rights during the second quarter was the result of several factors including,  but not limited to(1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for highermargin packages and certain higher-margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum,  high fructose corn syrup (''HFCS') and resin; and (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs.  The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE is North American franchise rights during the fourth quarter was primarily driven by financial market conditions as of the measurement date that caused (1) a dramatic increase in market debt rates,  which impacted the capital charge,  and (2) a significant decline in the funded status of CCE is defined benefit pension plans.  In addition,  the market price of CCE is common stock declined by more than 50 percent between the date of CCE is interim impairment test (May 232008) and the date of CCE is annual impairment test (October 24,  2008).  Our proportionate share of these charges was recorded to equity income (loss)—net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Equity Income (Loss)— Net' and Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2006,  our Company recorded a charge of approximately $602 million in equity income (loss)—net,  which primarily represented our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by CCE.  These charges impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Equity Income (Loss)—Net' and Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2006,  our Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $41 million,  primarily related to trademarks for beverages sold in the Philippines and Indonesia.  The Philippines and Indonesia are components of the Pacific operating segment.  The amount of these impairment charges was determined by comparing the fair values of the intangible assets to their respective carrying values.  The fair values were determined using discounted cash flow models.  Because the fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets,  we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of the assets to their respective fair values.  These impairment charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of income.  
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  delivery of products has occurred,  the sales price is fixed or determinable,  and collectibility is reasonably assured.  For our Company,  this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partnersresellers or other customers.  In particular,  title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations,  as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction.  Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.  In addition,  our customers can earn certain incentives,  which are included in deductions from revenue,  a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.  These incentives include,  but are not limited to,  cash discounts,  funds for promotional and marketing activities,  volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs.  Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programsincluding amortization expense on infrastructure programs,  was approximately $44 billion,  $41 billion and $38 billion for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  In preparing the financial statements,  management must make estimates related to the contractual terms,  customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue.  Management also considers past results in making such estimates.  The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.  Such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant.  Income Taxes In July 2006,  the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.  48,  ''Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes' (''Interpretation No.  48').  Interpretation No.  48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise is financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.  109,  ''Accounting for Income Taxes. ' Interpretation No.  48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Interpretation No.  48 also provides guidance on derecognition,  classification,  interest and penalties,  accounting in interim periods,  disclosure and transition.  Our Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No.  48 effective January 1,  2007.  As a result of the adoption of Interpretation No.  48,  we recorded an approximate $65 million increase in accrued income taxes in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefitswhich was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the January 1,  2007,  balance of reinvested earnings.  Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  (2) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  but for a lesser amount,  or (3) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.  For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain,  (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information,  (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes,  legislative intent,  regulations,  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position,  and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken.  We adjust these reserves,  including any impact on the related interest and penalties,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  The tax 
benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the ''more likely than not' recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  (2) the tax position,  amount,  and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation,  or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.  As a result,  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over timesuch as depreciation expense.  These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Based on the evaluation of all available information,  the Company recognizes future tax benefits,  such as net operating loss carryforwards,  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.  We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results,  the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences,  taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies.  A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.  Additionally,  undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference,  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction.  The Company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions.  Should we change our plans,  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities.  The Company is effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 230 percent to 240 percent in 2009.  This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2009.  Contingencies Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies,  mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters (both income taxes and indirect taxes).  Due to their nature,  such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including,  but not limited to,  court rulings,  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions.  Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances,  as appropriate.  Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings,  tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.

Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.  
Operations Review We manufacture,  distribute and market nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  We also manufacture,  distribute and market finished beverages.  Our organizational structure as of December 31,  2008consisted of the following operating segments,  the first six of which are sometimes referred to as ''operating groups' or ''groups': Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate.  We revised previously reported group information to conform to our operating structure in effect as of December 31,  2008.  For further information regarding our operating segments,  including a discussion of changes made to our operating segments effective July 1,  2008,  refer to Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Beverage Volume We measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales.  A ''unit case' is a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S.  fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings).  Unit case volume represents the number of unit cases of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners (''Coca-Cola system') to customers.  Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks.  Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to,  or distributed by,  our Company,  and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit.  Such products licensed to,  or distributed by,  our Company or owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume.  In addition,  unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest.  Unit case volume is derived based on estimates supplied by our bottling partners and distributors.  Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates,  syrups,  beverage bases and powders (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by,  or used in finished beverages sold bythe Company to its bottling partners or other customers.  Most of our revenues are based on concentrate sales,  a primarily wholesale activity.  Unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.  Factors such as seasonality,  bottlers' inventory practices,  supply point changes,  timing of price increases,  new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates.  In addition to the items mentioned above,  the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures,  in which the Company has an equity interest,  but to which the Company does not sell concentrates,  may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates.

Bottling Investments 
Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.  
Geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas,  both consolidated and unconsolidated.  
Unit Case Volume Although most of our Company is revenues are not based directly on unit case volume,  we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures our product trends at the consumer level.  The Coca-Cola system sold approximately 237 billion unit cases of our products in 2008,  approximately 227 billion unit cases in 2007 and approximately 214 billion unit cases in 2006.  In Eurasia and Africa,  unit case volume increased 7 percent in 2008 versus 2007,  which reflected growth in sparkling and still beverages of 4 percent and 21 percent,  respectively.  Unit case volume growth of 15 percent in Turkey,  14 percent in India and 11 percent in Southern Eurasia drove current year growth.  Acquisitions contributed 6 percent of the unit case volume growth in Turkey during 2008.  High single-digit volume growth in North and West Africa and 7 percent volume growth in Nigeria also significantly contributed to the group is current year growth.  South Africa is unit case volume increased 1 percent for the year,  which included the impact of supply chain issues related to carbon dioxide shortages in the early portion of 2008.  Our system has invested in manufacturing capabilities that allow us to produce our own supply of carbon dioxide to mitigate the risk of future shortages.  Russia is unit case volume was even for the year,  primarily due to a more challenging economic environment and unseasonable weather during the summer.  Unit case volume in Europe increased 3 percent in 2008 compared to 2007,  primarily attributable to high single-digit volume growth in Eastern Europe.  The group is unit case volume growth reflected 1 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 11 percent growth in still beverages.  The unit case volume growth in sparkling beverages included 1 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola.  Also included in the group is 2008 volume growth was the impact of a low single-digit volume decline in Iberia,  primarily due to the slowing Western European economy and a truckers' strike in Spain during the second quarter of 2008.  In Latin America,  unit case volume increased 8 percent in 2008 versus 2007.  The group benefited from strong volume growth in all key markets,  including 9 percent in Mexico,  7 percent in Brazil and 5 percent in Argentina.  Acquisitions contributed 3 percent of the group is total unit case volume growth in 2008.  The group is unit case volume growth consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 40 percent growth in still beverages.  Sparkling beverage unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to a 4 percent volume growth in Coca-Cola.  The successful integration of Jugos del Valle,  S. A. B.  de C. V.  (''Jugos del Valle'),  which we acquired jointly with Coca-Cola FEMSA in 2007,  drove still beverage volume growth.  Still beverage unit case volume grew 21 percent during the year,  excluding the impact of acquisitions.  Unit case volume in North America decreased 1 percent in 2008 compared to 2007,  which reflected the impact of a difficult U.S.  economic environment and significant bottler price increases during the fourth quarter of 2008.  The overall unit case volume decline in North America during 2008 consisted of a 3 percent unit case volume decline in sparkling beverages,  partially offset by a 5 percent increase in still beverages.  The current year decline in sparkling beverages was partly attributable to the softness of our Foodservice business and other on-premise channels,  both of which were negatively impacted by the current economic conditions.  The negative impact of current macro-economic conditions and bottler price increases was tempered by the successful execution of the three-cola strategy (focusing on driving unit case volume growth for Coca-Cola,  Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Coke).  Coca-Cola Zero continued its strong performance,  increasing unit case volume 36 percent in 2008.  Still beverage unit case volume increased 5 percent in the current year,  primarily due to the strong performance of glacéau,  Fuze,  Trademark Simply and Minute Maid Enhanced Juices.  Acquisitions contributed 4 percent of the volume growth in still beverages during 2008.  The overall 5 percent unit case volume growth in still beverages also included the impact of volume declines in Trademark Dasani and Trademark Powerade during 2008,  primarily due to the slowing water and sports drink categories.  In the Pacific,  unit case volume increased 8 percent in 2008 versus 2007.  The current year unit case volume growth was driven by 19 percent volume growth in China,  which consisted of growth in both sparkling and still beverages.  China is sparkling unit case volume increased 15 percent,  primarily attributable to double-digit volume growth in both Trademark Coca-Cola and Trademark Sprite.  Double-digit unit case volume growth in 
Minute Maid accounted for the majority of China is 30 percent unit case volume growth in still beverages.  Also contributing to the volume growth of still beverages in China was the impact of Yuan Ye,  an original leaf teawhich was launched earlier in the year.  The strong performance in China across our brands is partly attributable to our successful activation of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.  In Japan,  unit case volume was even in 2008.  Sparkling beverage unit case volume grew 5 percent for the year,  led by 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 13 percent growth in Trademark Fanta.  Unit case volume growth in Trademark Coca-Cola was primarily attributable to the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero and the successful execution of the three-cola strategy (focusing on driving unit case volume growth for Coca-Cola,  Coca-Cola Zero and Diet Coke or Coca-Cola light).  Still beverage unit case volume declined 1 percent in 2008,  primarily due to declines in Sokenbicha and Aquarius.  The impact of these volume declines on still beverages was partially offset by a 2 percent unit case volume increase in Georgia Coffee.  Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 14 percent in 2008 compared to 2007.  The current year unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to the full year impact of prior year acquisitions,  includingbut not limited to,  18 bottling and distribution operations in Germany,  Nordeste Refrigerantes S. A.  (' NORSA') and CCBPI.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Additionally,  the unit case volume growth reflected the overall improving health of the Company is consolidated bottling operations.  The favorable impact that the previously mentioned items had on unit case volume growth was partially offset by the sale of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda.  (''Remil'),  a bottler in Brazil,  and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd.  (''Coca-Cola Pakistan'),  which resulted in its deconsolidation.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Other Income (Loss)—Net' and Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In Eurasia and Africa,  unit case volume increased 12 percent in 2007 compared to 2006.  Double-digit unit case volume growth in South Africa,  Russia,  India,  Turkey,  Middle East and Southern Eurasia drove the results.  South Africa unit case volume increased 13 percent in 2007,  primarily attributable to strong marketing,  the replenishment of trade inventory resulting from the carbon dioxide shortage in the fourth quarter of 2006 and favorable weather.  In India,  continued investment in marketing initiatives on the quality and safety of our products and focus on improved execution by the consolidated bottling operations resulted in 14 percent unit case volume growth.  In addition,  strong marketing and bottler execution resulted in solid volume growth in North and West Africa and in East and Central Africa during 2007.  Unit case volume in Europe increased 5 percent in 2007 compared to 2006,  primarily due to unit case volume growth in most key countries,  including double-digit unit case volume growth in Eastern Europe.  The results reflected the benefits of key initiatives across the group,  including Coca-Cola Zero launches and the three-cola strategy,  The Coke Side of Life Campaign,  Christmas programs,  and activation of the Rugby World Cup.  In addition,  the full year impact of the 2006 acquisition of Apollinaris GmbH,  a German premium source water brand (''Apollinaris'),  and the 2006 joint acquisition of Fonti del Vulture S, r, l.  (''Fonti del Vulture'),  an Italian mineral water company,  with Coca-Cola Hellenic contributed to unit case volume growth in 2007.  The group is 2007 unit case volume growth reflected the negative impact of unseasonably cool and rainy summer weather and the favorable impact the World Cup had on volume in 2006.  In Latin America,  unit case volume increased 9 percent in 2007 versus 2006,  which reflected volume growth of 16 percent in Brazil,  6 percent in Mexico and 9 percent in Argentina.  The group is unit case volume growth included a 7 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola,  primarily due to the introduction of Coca-Cola Zero during the first quarter of 2007.  The acquisition of Leao Junior,  S. A.  (''Leao Junior') in Brazil also favorably impacted the unit case volume in 2007.  Unit case volume in North America decreased 1 percent in 2007 versus 2006,  reflecting a 1 percent decline in the Foodservice and Hospitality business due to the challenging restaurant industry environment.  Unit case volume in Retail was even in 2007,  reflecting a 1 percent favorable impact from acquisitions primarily related to glacéau.  In 2007,  the Company transferred the majority of the distribution of glacéau branded products to its 
existing bottling system with the exception of certain regional glacéau distributors and certain channels.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Unit case volume for glacéau beverages was 56 million unit cases in 2006.  Retail unit case volume was unfavorably impacted by the difficult sparkling beverage industry environment and by a unit case volume decline in warehouse-delivered water resulting from the strategic decision to refocus resources behind the more profitable Dasani business.  Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 2 percent in 2007 compared to 2006,  reflecting the expected difficult category environment resulting from increased retail pricing.  In 2007,  Coca-Cola Zero had double-digit unit case volume growth and both Trademark Dasani and Trademark Powerade volume continued to grow.  Warehouse-delivered juice unit case volume declined due to retail price increases taken to cover higher ingredient costs.  This decline was partially offset by continued unit case volume growth in Trademark Odwalla and Trademark Simply juices.  Unit case volume in the Pacific increased 7 percent in 2007 compared to 2006,  which reflected volume growth of 18 percent in China,  5 percent in the Philippines and 3 percent in Japan.  Unit case volume growth in China was led by double-digit growth in sparkling beverages,  Minute Maid and Nestea.  In Japan,  the increase in unit case volume was primarily due to growth in Trademark Coca-Cola,  Trademark Sprite,  Sokenbicha and water brands.  Georgia Coffee volume declined 1 percent in 2007; however,  as a result of success with a new marketing campaign,  it returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Unit case volume growth in the Philippines was largely attributable to strong volume growth in sparkling beverages,  primarily due to investments in key marketing initiatives,  the focus on improving the route-to-market,  reshaping and streamlining the supply chain and building sales capabilities.  On February 22,  2007,  the Company acquired the remaining 65 percent ownership interest in CCBPI held by San Miguel Corporation and two of its subsidiaries (collectively,  ''SMC') and began to implement certain initiatives to address business performance.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 64 percent in 2007 versus 2006.  The unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions made during 2007,  including,  but not limited to18 bottling and distribution operations in Germany,  NORSA and CCBPI.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Unit case volume growth in 2007 also reflected growth across the group.  Concentrate Sales Volume Company-wide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume grew 4 percent and 5 percent,  respectivelyin 2008 compared to 2007.  The differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates for all segments were primarily due to timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures,  in which the Company is a partner but to which the Company does not sell concentrate.  Company-wide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 6 percent in 2007 compared to 2006.  Differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates for all segments were primarily due to timing of concentrate shipments.

The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments.  Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by concentrate sales volume growth rates,  structural changes,  price and product/geographic mix and foreign currency fluctuations.  The size and timing of structural changes,  including acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and canning operations,  do not occur consistently from period to period.  As a result,  anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues (and other financial statement line items) usually is not possible.  However,  we expect to continue to buy and sell bottling interests in limited circumstances and,  as a result,  structural changes will continue to affect our consolidated financial statements in future periods.  Gross Profit Our gross profit margin increased to 644 percent in 2008 from 639 percent in 2007.  The increase in our gross profit margin was primarily attributable to favorable price and product mix across the majority of our operating segments,  as well as the favorable impact of the sale of Remil and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Pakistan,  which resulted in its deconsolidation.  Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Generally,  bottling and finished product operations produce higher net revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations.  The favorable impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the full year impact of 2007 acquisitions,  including,  but not limited to,  18 German bottling and distribution operations,  NORSA,  glacéau,  CCBPI and Leao Junior.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition to the full year impact of prior year acquisitions,  our 2008 gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by increases in the cost of raw materials and freight.  Our gross profit margin decreased to 639 percent in 2007 from 661 percent in 2006.  The decrease in our gross profit margin in 2007 was primarily due to the partial year impact of acquisitions made during 2007including,  but not limited to,  18 German bottling and distribution operations,  NORSA,  glacéau,  CCBPI and Leao Junior.  In addition to the partial year impact of 2007 acquisitions,  the full year impact of the acquisition of CCCIL and the consolidation of Brucephil during 2006 also contributed to the decline in our 2007 gross profit margin.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our 2007 gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by increases in the cost of raw materials and freight.  
Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses The following table sets forth the significant components of selling,  general and administrative expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31 2008 
Selling expenses Advertising expenses General and administrative expenses Stock-based compensation expense 
Selling,  general and administrative expenses 
Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased $829 million,  or 8 percent,  in 2008 compared to 2007.  This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,  which accounted for approximately 4 percent of the total increase in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  In addition to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,  the increase in advertising expenses reflected the Company is continued investment in our brands and building market execution capabilities.  Selling expenses increased primarily to support our bottling operations.  In addition to the previously mentioned items,  the increase in selling,  general and administrative expenses in 2008 was also partially attributable to the full year impact of bottlers and brands acquired during 2007.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  These increases were partially offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses,  primarily due to expense management and productivity initiatives.  In addition,  general and administrative expenses during 2008 also benefited from the full year impact of amendments made to the U.S.  retiree medical plan and other employee benefit related costs during 2007.  Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the amendments made to the U.S.  retiree medical plan during 2007.  Stock-based compensation expense benefited from the reversal of previously recognized expenses related to performance based long-term incentive plans due to our revised outlook of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future years.  Refer to the heading ''Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position—Foreign Exchange' for further discussion of the anticipated impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  As of December 31,  2008,  we had approximately $368 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 years as stock-based compensation expense.  This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.  Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The significant decline in the equity markets precipitated by the recent credit crisis and financial system instability has negatively affected the value of our pension plan assets.  As a result of this decline,  along with a decrease in the discount rate,  our 2009 pension cost will increase by approximately $100 million.  Our pension cost in years beyond 2009 may also be impacted by these changes.  In addition,  as a result of the decline in fair value of our pension plans assets and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension benefit obligations,  we have made and will consider making additional contributions to our U.S.  and international pension plans in 2009.  Refer to the heading ''Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations' and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased $1514 million,  or 16 percent,  in 2007 compared to 2006.  This increase was primarily related to continued investments in marketing,  increased costs to drive growth in our consolidated bottling operations,  including a 6 percent increase related to the acquisitions and consolidations of certain bottling operations (refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)increased sales and service costs for certain brand acquisitions and a 4 percent increase due to foreign currency 
fluctuations.  Selling and advertising expenses increased 20 percent in 2007 compared to 2006,  on a combined basis.  The increases in selling and advertising expenses were primarily related to increased investments in marketing and innovation activities,  including the reinvestment of certain general and administrative expense savings derived from productivity initiatives.  Selling and advertising expenses also increased due to costs to drive growth in our consolidated bottling operations,  including a 6 percent increase related to the acquisitions and consolidations of certain bottling operations and a 4 percent increase due to foreign currency fluctuations.  General and administrative expenses increased 8 percent in 2007,  primarily due to increased costs in our consolidated bottling operations,  including a 4 percent impact relating to the acquisitions and consolidations of certain bottling operations,  increased costs related to our short-term incentive plan based on the Company is financial performance,  and a 3 percent increase due to foreign currency fluctuations.  These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by expense savings generated through productivity initiatives and a decrease of approximately $82 million in our annual net periodic benefits costs,  primarily due to the impact of amendments made to the U.S.  retiree medical plan during 2007.  Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the amendments made to the U.S.  retiree medical plan during 2007.

Total 
During 2008,  the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $350 million,  consisting of restructuring charges,  contract termination fees,  expenses related to productivity initiatives and asset impairments.  The Company incurred restructuring costs of approximately $194 million during 2008.  These costs were primarily related to steps the Company took in 2007 to streamline and simplify its operations globally,  which included the closing of a beverage concentrate manufacturing and distribution plant in Drogheda,  Ireland,  as well as streamlining activities in other selected business units.  The Company has incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $410 million related to these restructuring activities since they commenced.  The Company does not anticipate recognizing any additional significant expenses as part of this plan.  The expected payback period for this plan is three to four years.  Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $55 million related to productivity initiatives since they commenced in the first quarter of 2008.  The Company is targeting $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by the end of 2011 to provide additional flexibility to invest for growth.  The savings are expected to be generated in a number of areas,  and include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques; redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness; better leveraging our size and scale; and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a ''procure-to-pay' program.  In realizing these savings,  the Company expects to incur total costs of approximately $500 million by the end of 2011.  Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Other operating charges in 2008 also included approximately $63 million of costs associated with contract termination fees and approximately $38 million related to asset impairments.  The contract termination fees were primarily the result of penalties incurred by the Company to terminate existing supply and co-packer agreements.  Charges related to asset impairments were primarily due to the write-down of manufacturing lines that produce product packaging materials.  Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2007,  the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $254 million,  primarily related to restructuring costs and asset impairments.  These restructuring costs and asset impairments included the reorganization of the North American business around three main business units: Sparkling Beverages,  Still Beverages and Emerging Brands.  They also included the plan to close a beverage concentrate manufacturing and distribution plant in Drogheda,  Ireland,  as well as individually insignificant streamlining activities throughout many other business units.  Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Also in 2007,  other operating charges included charges related to asset impairments,  none of which was individually significant.  During 2006,  our Company recorded other operating charges of $185 million.  Of these chargesapproximately $108 million were primarily related to the impairment of assets and investments in our bottling operations,  approximately $53 million were the result of contract termination fees related to production capacity efficiencies and approximately $24 million were related to other restructuring costs.  None of these charges was individually significant.  The impairment charges were primarily the result of a revised outlook for certain assets and bottling operations in Asia,  which had been impacted by unfavorable market conditions and declines in volume.  Refer to the discussion under ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill,  Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, ' and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As demonstrated by the tables above,  the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by each operating segment fluctuated from year to year.  Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following:  In 2008,  foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by approximately 6 percent,  primarily due to a weaker U.S.  dollar compared to the euro,  Japanese yen and Brazilian realwhich had a favorable impact on the Europe,  Pacific,  Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments.  The favorable impact of a weaker U.S.  dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S.  dollar compared to the South African rand and the British pound,  which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa,  Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments.  Refer to the heading ''Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position—Foreign Exchange. '  In 2008,  price increases across the majority of operating segments had a favorable impact on both operating income and operating margins.   In 2008,  increased spending on marketing and innovation activities impacted the majority of the operating segments' operating income and operating margins.  Refer to the heading ''Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses, ' above.   In 2008,  increases in the cost of raw materials and product mix,  primarily as a result of finished goods businesses,  adversely impacted North America is operating income and operating margin.   In 2008,  our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by the full year impact of acquisitions made during 2007,  including,  but not limited to,  18 German bottling and distribution operations,  NORSAglacéau,  CCBPI and Leao Junior.  Refer to the heading ''Gross Profit, ' above.  These acquisitions impacted the Latin America,  North America and Bottling Investments operating segments.   In 2008,  operating income was reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa,  $1 million for Latin America,  $56 million for North America,  $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate,  primarily due to restructuring costs,  contract termination fees,  productivity initiatives and asset impairments.  Refer to the heading ''Other Operating Charges, ' above.   In 2007,  foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by approximately 4 percent,  primarily related to a weaker U.S.  dollar compared to the euro,  Brazilian real and Australian dollar,  which had a favorable impact on the Europe,  Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments.  The favorable impact of a weaker U.S.  dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S.  dollar compared to the Japanese yen and South African rand,  which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa,  Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments.  Refer to the heading ''Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position—Foreign Exchange. '  In 2007,  price increases across the majority of operating segments had a favorable impact on both operating income and operating margins.   In 2007,  increased spending on marketing and innovation activities impacted the majority of the operating segments' operating income.  Refer to the heading ''Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses, ' above.   In 2007,  operating income was reduced by approximately $37 million for Eurasia and Africa,  $33 million for Europe,  $4 million for Latin America,  $23 million for North America,  $3 million for Pacific$47 million for Bottling Investments and $121 million for Corporate,  primarily due to restructuring costs and asset impairments,  included in other operating charges and cost of goods sold.  Refer to the heading ''Other Operating Charges, ' above.  
 In 2007,  operating income and operating margin for Latin America,  North America and Pacific reflected the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials primarily in the finished goods businesses.   In 2007,  operating income and operating margin for Bottling Investments reflected the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of certain bottling operations.  Refer to the heading ''Gross Profit, ' above.   In 2006,  operating income was reduced by approximately $3 million for Eurasia and Africa,  $36 million for Europe,  $62 million for Pacific,  $87 million for Bottling Investments and $1 million for Corporate primarily due to contract termination fees related to production capacity efficiencies,  asset impairments and other restructuring costs.  Refer to the heading ''Other Operating Charges, ' above.   In 2006,  operating income was reduced by $100 million for Corporate as a result of a donation made to The Coca-Cola Foundation.  Interest Income and Interest Expense Our Company monitors our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt versus long-term debt.  This monitoring includes a review of business and other financial risks.  From time to time,  we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other related instruments to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.  Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Interest income increased by $97 million in 2008 compared to 2007.  This increase was primarily due to higher average short-term investment balances,  partially offset by lower interest rates.  Interest expense decreased by $18 million in 2008 compared to 2007.  This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on short-term debt and a net benefit of approximately $8 million related to the reclassification of gains and losses on interest rate locks from AOCI to interest expense.  This net benefit consisted of approximately $17 million of previously unrecognized gains related to cash flow hedges that were discontinued during the second quarter of 2008,  as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long-term debt for which these hedges were designated,  which was partially offset by approximately $9 million of losses related to the portion of cash flow hedges that were deemed to be ineffective during 2008.  The favorable impact of aforementioned items was partially offset by the impact of higher average short-term and long-term debt balances.  We expect net interest expense to increase in 2009 due to forecasted higher debt balances.  Refer to the heading ''Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position. ' In 2007,  interest income increased by $43 million compared to 2006,  primarily due to higher average short-term investment balances,  partially offset by a decline in interest rates.  Interest expense in 2007 increased by $236 million compared to 2006,  primarily due to issuance of $1750 million of notes due November 15,  2017,  and higher average balances on commercial paper borrowings in the U.S.,  partially offset by a decline in interest rates.  The net proceeds of approximately $1747 million from this long-term debt issuance and the increase in commercial paper borrowings were primarily used to finance 2007 acquisitions.  Equity Income (Loss)—Net Equity income (loss)—net represents our Company is proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investments.  In 2008,  equity income (loss)—net was an equity loss of approximately $874 million compared to equity income of approximately $668 million in 2007,  a decrease of $1542 million.  This decrease was primarily attributable to impairment charges recorded by CCE during 2008,  of which our Company is proportionate share was approximately $16 billion.  Refer to the heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill,  Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets' and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition to our proportionate share of the charges discussed above,  the Company recorded charges of approximately $60 million to equity income (loss)—net,  primarily related to our 57 
proportionate share of restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded by certain equity method investees.  Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The impact of these charges was partially offset by our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees,  which included the favorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.  In 2007,  equity income (loss)—net was an equity income of approximately $668 million compared to $102 million in 2006,  an increase of $566 million.  This increase was primarily attributable to an impairment charge recorded by CCE during 2006,  of which our Company is proportionate share was approximately $602 million.  Refer to heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Goodwill,  Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, ' and Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Additionally,  the increase in 2007 also reflected our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees as a result of the overall improving health of the Coca-Cola bottling system in most of the world,  our proportionate share of tax benefits recorded by CCE and the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  The favorable impact of these items was partially offset by our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by Coca-Cola Amatil,  restructuring charges recorded by CCE,  the write-off of excess bottles and cases at CCBPI and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of equity method investments during 2007 and 2006.  Refer to Note 3 and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Other Income (Loss)—Net Other income (loss)—net includes,  among other things,  the impact of foreign exchange gains and lossesdividend income,  rental income,  gains and losses related to the disposal of property,  plant and equipmentrealized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities,  realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities,  other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities,  the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions and minority shareowners' proportionate share of net income of certain consolidated subsidiaries.  In 2008,  other income (loss)—net was a loss of $28 million.  The Company recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges of approximately $81 million on available-for-sale securities.  Refer to the heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Investments in Equity and Debt Securities' and Note 10 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Other income (loss)—net also included approximately $46 million of realized and unrealized losses on trading securities.  These losses,  along with other charges that were not individually significant,  were partially offset by gains on divestitures of approximately $119 million,  primarily related to the sale of Remil to Coca-Cola FEMSA and the sale of a portion of the Company is investment in Coca-Cola Pakistan to Coca-Cola Icecek A. S.  (''Coca-Cola Icecek').  Refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2007,  other income (loss)—net was income of $173 million.  The Company recognized a gain of approximately $73 million due to the sale of a portion of the Company is ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil.  As a result of this transaction,  our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil was reduced from approximately 32 percent to 30 percent.  In addition,  we recognized a gain of approximately $70 million as a result of the sale of our equity investment in Vonpar Refrescos S. A.  (''Vonpar') and gains of approximately $84 million due to the sale of real estate in Spain and the United States.  Refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2006,  other income (loss)—net was income of $195 million,  primarily attributable to a gain of approximately $175 million as a result of the sale of a portion of our Coca-Cola FEMSA shares to FEMSA and a gain of approximately $123 million due to the sale of a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek shares in an initial public offering.  These gains were partially offset by the accretion of approximately $58 million of expense related to the discounted value of our liability to purchase Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetraenke AG (''CCEAG') shares and approximately $15 million in foreign currency exchange losses.  Refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Income Taxes Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United Stateswhich are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S.  statutory rate of 35 percent.  A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Company is periodic effective tax rate.  Our effective tax rate of approximately 219 percent for the year ended December 31,  2008,  included the following:  an approximate 20 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges,  other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities,  contract termination fees,  productivity initiatives and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 18 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  an approximate 23 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees,  primarily related to impairment charges recorded by CCE (refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  an approximate 24 percent combined effective tax rate on gains from divestitures (refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  a tax charge of approximately $10 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and  a net tax benefit of approximately $5 million,  primarily related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions under Interpretation No.  48,  including interest and penalties (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Our effective tax rate of approximately 240 percent for the year ended December 31,  2007,  included the following:  an approximate 18 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 18 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  an approximate 14 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of restructuring charges and tax rate changes recorded by CCE,  and asset impairments recorded by CCBPI and Coca-Cola Amatil (refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  an approximate 58 percent combined effective tax rate on the sale of a portion of our equity interest in Coca-Cola Amatil and Vonpar (refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  a tax benefit of approximately $19 million related to tax rate changes in Germany (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and  a tax charge of approximately $96 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions under Interpretation No.  48,  including interest and penalties (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  Our effective tax rate of approximately 228 percent for the year ended December 31,  2006,  included the following:  an approximate 16 percent combined effective tax rate on asset impairments,  impairments of investments in our bottling operations,  contract termination fees and restructuring charges recorded by the Company (refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 
 an approximate 88 percent net effective tax rate on our proportionate share of impairment chargesrestructuring charges and the impact of certain tax rate changes recorded by CCE (refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);  an approximate 18 percent tax benefit on the sale of a portion of our investments in Coca-Cola Icecek and Coca-Cola FEMSA.  The tax benefit was a result of the reversal of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets recorded related to capital loss carryforwards.  In addition to the impact of the reversal of valuation allowances,  we also benefited from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to differences between the book and tax bases in the stock sold.  The tax benefit associated with the aforementioned items was partially offset by a reduction of deferred tax assets due to the utilization of these capital loss carryforwards.  The capital loss carryforwards offset the taxable gain on the sale of a portion of our investments in Coca-Cola Icecek and Coca-Cola FEMSA (refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and  a tax charge of approximately $24 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  The Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No.  48 effective January 1,  2007.  As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No.  48,  the Company recorded an increase of approximately $65 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,  which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1,  2007,  balance of reinvested earnings.  As of December 31,  2007,  the Company had recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $643 million.  In 2008,  agreements were reached between the U.S.  government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions.  Pursuant to these agreements,  we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest.  These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008,  and tax refunds and interest on refunds to be received in 2009.  These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods.  The settlements did not have a material impact on the Company is consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31,  2008.  The impact of these agreements,  and other 2008 activity,  is reflected in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax assets as of December 31,  2008,  which are further discussed below.  As of December 31,  2008,  the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $369 million.  If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,  the net effect would be a benefit to the Company is effective tax rate of approximately $174 million.  The remaining approximately $195 million,  which was recorded as a deferred tax asset,  primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.  The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  The Company had approximately $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31,  2008.  If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,  the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company is effective tax rate.  Based on current tax laws,  the Company is effective tax rate in 2009 is expected to be approximately 230 percent to 240 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years.  Liquidity,  Capital Resources and Financial Position We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths.  The near-term outlook for our business remains strong and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2009.  As a result of our expected strong cash flows from operations,  we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments.  We typically fund a significant portion of our dividends,  capital expenditures,  contractual obligations,  share repurchases and acquisitions with cash generated from operating 
activities.  We rely on external funding for additional cash requirements.  The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock,  instead,  we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity.  Refer to the heading ''Cash Flows from Financing Activities—Debt Financing, ' below.  Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy.  Despite the recent disruption to the general credit markets,  our liquidity remains strong,  and our commercial paper program continues to function each day.  We are able to access 60- to 90-day terms and have not had a material change to our spreads to benchmark rates; however,  there is no assurance that this will not change in the future.  The Company is reviewing its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.  We may replace a certain amount of commercial paper and short-term debt with longer-term debt in the future.  On September 3,  2008,  we announced our intention to make cash offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited,  a Hong Kong listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business throughout China (''Huiyuan').  Assuming full acceptance of the offers,  the transaction is valued at approximately $24 billion.  Refer to the heading ''Additional Information. ' Due to this pending transaction,  the Company curtailed its share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2008,  and does not anticipate repurchasing shares during 2009.  The significant decline in the equity markets precipitated by the recent credit crisis and financial system instability has negatively affected the value of our pension plan assets.  As a result of the decline in fair value of our pension plan assets,  we have made and will consider making additional contributions to our U.S.  and international pension plans in 2009.  Refer to the heading ''Aggregate Contractual Obligations' and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  The majority of the Company is cash is held by our international subsidiaries.  We have reviewed our contingency plans and would be able to access cash held by our international subsidiaries on short notice.  Our approximate $47 billion cash balance as of December 31,  2008,  is available and held in liquid,  high-quality cash equivalent investments.  However,  in the event that we required the use of cash held by our international subsidiaries for an extended period of time in the United States,  we would be required to treat the cash as having been repatriated and we would incur significant tax liabilities.  Refer to the heading ''Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Income Taxes, ' above.  In addition to the Company is cash balances and commercial paper program,  we also maintain $26 billion of committed,  currently unused credit facilities from our network of relationship banks.  These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2009 through 2013.  We have evaluated the financial stability of each bank and believe we can access the funds,  if needed.  Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Based on all of these factors,  the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong,  and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006 was approximately $7571 million,  $7150 million and $5957 million,  respectively.  Cash flows from operating activities increased $421 million,  or 6 percent,  in 2008 compared to 2007.  This increase was primarily attributable to increased cash collections from customers,  driven by the 11 percent increase in net operating revenues.  Refer to heading ''Operations Review—Net Operating Revenues. ' The impact of increased cash collections from customers was partially offset by increased payments to suppliers and vendors,  increased payments for selling,  general and administrative expenses and an increase in tax payments.  The increase in payments to suppliers and vendors was primarily attributable to higher sales volume and increased marketing and advertising costs to support our brands.  The increase in tax payments included payments associated with the agreement between the U.S.  government and a foreign government.  Refer to the heading ''Operations Review—Income Taxes' and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Additionally,  the Company made approximately $224 million in payments related to streamlining activities and the costs of productivity initiatives during 2008.  Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  On May 26,  2008,  the Company and the other defendants reached an agreement with the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit (Carpenters Health & Welfare Fund of Philadelphia & Vicinity v.  The Coca-Cola Company,  et al. ) to settle the lawsuit for approximately $138 million,  without admitting any wrongdoing.  The settlement amount was covered by insurance and,  therefore,  the settlement had no impact on our consolidated statement of income.  The payments related to this settlement were made directly from the insurers to the plaintiffs during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008.  As a result,  the settlement had no impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows.  Cash flows from operating activities increased $1193 million,  or 20 percent,  in 2007 compared to 2006.  This increase was primarily related to increased cash receipts from customers in 2007,  which was driven by a 20 percent rise in net operating revenues.  These higher cash collections were offset in part by increased payments to suppliers and vendors in 2007,  primarily related to the increased cost of goods sold to support the higher sales volumes,  and secondarily related to higher cash payments for selling,  general and administrative related costs.  Cash flows from operating activities in 2007 were also reduced due to an increase in interest payments of $193 million and an increase in cash payments for streamlining initiatives of $83 million.  Cash flows from operating activities in 2006 included the impact of increased tax payments made related to repatriation of foreign earnings under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,  a contribution of approximately $216 million to a U.S.  Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (''VEBA'),  a tax-qualified trust to fund retiree medical benefits and a $100 million donation made to The Coca-Cola Foundation.  Refer to Note 16 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the contribution to a VEBA.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows used in investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31 2008 
Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities: Acquisitions and investments,  principally beverage and bottling companies and trademarks Purchases of other investments Proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments Purchases of property,  plant and equipment Proceeds from disposals of property,  plant and equipment Other investing activities Net cash used in investing activities

Refer to Note 3 and Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2007,  our Company acquired glacéau,  18 German bottling and distribution operations,  Fuze Beverage,  LLC (''Fuze') and Leao Junior.  Our Company also completed the acquisition of the remaining 
65 percent of the shares of capital stock of CCBPI not previously owned by our Company.  In addition,  the Company acquired a 50 percent interest in Jugos del Valle,  a 34 percent interest in Tokyo Coca-Cola Bottling Company (''Tokyo CCBC') and an 11 percent interest in NORSA.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The remaining amount of cash used for acquisitions and investments was primarily related to the acquisition of various trademarks and brands,  none of which was individually significant.  Investing activities in 2007 also included proceeds of approximately $238 million received from the sale of our 49 percent equity interest in Vonpar,  approximately $143 million received from the sale of a portion of our interest in Coca-Cola Amatil,  and approximately $106 million in proceeds from the sale of real estate in Spain and in the United States.  Refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investing activities in 2006 also included proceeds of approximately $198 million received from the sale of shares in connection with the initial public offering of Coca-Cola Icecek and proceeds of approximately $427 million received from the sale of a portion of Coca-Cola FEMSA shares to FEMSA.  Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Net purchases of property,  plant and equipment for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006 were approximately $1839 million,  $1409 million and $1295 million,  respectively.  These increases were primarily related to acquisitions of certain bottling operations in 2007 and 2006.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Generally,  bottling and finished product operations are more capital intensive compared to concentrate and syrup operations.  Additionally,  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations during 2008 also contributed to the increase in reported purchases of property,  plant and equipment.  Refer to the heading ''Foreign Exchange, ' below.  Our Company currently estimates that net purchases of property,  plant and equipment in 2009 will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion.  Total capital expenditures for property,  plant and equipment (including our investments in information technology) and the percentage of such totals by operating segment for 2008,  2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 Capital expenditures (in millions) Eurasia & Africa Europe Latin America North America Pacific Bottling Investments Corporate 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows used in financing activities were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31 2008 
Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities: Issuances of debt Payments of debt Issuances of stock Purchases of stock for treasury Dividends 
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
Debt Financing Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows,  interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital.  We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital,  which increases our return on shareowners' equity.  This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates.  Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.  As of December 31,  2008,  our long-term debt was rated ''A+' by Standard & Poor is and ''Aa3' by Moody isand our commercial paper program was rated ''A-1' and ''P-1' by Standard & Poor is and Moody is,  respectively.  In assessing our credit strength,  both Standard & Poor is and Moody is consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company and certain bottlers,  including CCE and Coca-Cola Hellenic.  While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers,  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company is business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable.  It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology.  If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure,  our major bottlers' financial performance,  changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength or for any other reason,  our cost of borrowing could increase.  Additionally,  if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline,  the Company is share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers.  In October 2008,  Standard & Poor is affirmed the Company is A+ long-term debt rating,  but revised its outlook from stable to negative.  Moody is rating of Aa3 for the Company is long-term debt remains on negative outlook,  where it has been since 2001.  The Company does not believe that a downgrade by either agency would have a material adverse effect on the cost of borrowing.  We monitor our interest coverage ratio and,  as indicated above,  the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings.  However,  the rating agencies aggregate financial data for certain bottlers along with our Company when assessing our debt rating.  As such,  the key measure to rating agencies is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the Company and certain bottlers.  Both Standard & Poor is and Moody is employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio.  These thresholds are not necessarily permanent,  nor are they fully disclosed to our Company.  Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the worldenabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost.  This posture,  coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt,  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing.  Our debt management policies,  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity,  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.  
Issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities.  On December 31,  2008,  we had approximately $3462 million in lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities available,  of which approximately $677 million was outstanding.  This outstanding amount was primarily related to our international operations.  The issuances of debt in 2008 included approximately $4001 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days,  and approximately $194 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.  The payments of debt in 2008 included approximately $4032 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days.  The Company continues to review its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.  The issuances of debt in 2007 included approximately $6024 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days,  approximately $1750 million in issuances of long-term notes due November 15,  2017,  and approximately $2024 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.  The increase in debt was primarily due to 2007 acquisitions.  Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  During the fourth quarter of 2007,  the Company replaced a certain amount of commercial paper and short-term debt with longer-term debt.  Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The payments of debt in 2007 included approximately $5514 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days.  Included in these payments was the payment of the outstanding liability to CCEAG shareowners in January 2007 of $1068 million.  The issuances of debt in 2006 included approximately $484 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days.  The payments of debt in 2006 included approximately $580 million related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days and approximately $1383 million of net repayments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less.  Issuances of Stock The issuances of stock in 2008,  2007 and 2006 primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees.  In addition,  during 2007,  certain executive officers and former shareholders of glacéau invested approximately $179 million of their proceeds from the sale of glacéau in common stock of the Company at then current market prices.  These shares of Company common stock were placed in escrow pursuant to the glacéau acquisition agreement.  Share Repurchases In October 1996,  our Board of Directors authorized a plan (''1996 Plan') to repurchase up to 206 million shares of our Company is common stock through 2006.  On July 20,  2006,  the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Company is common stock.  The new program took effect upon the expiration of the 1996 Plan on October 31,  2006.  The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: Year Ended December 31 Number of shares repurchased (in millions) Average price per share 
Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31,  2008,  we have purchased approximately 13 billion shares of our Company is common stock at an average price per share of $1902.  
The Company curtailed its share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Additionally,  as a result of the pending acquisition of Huiyuan,  the Company does not anticipate repurchasing shares during 2009.  Dividends At its February 2009 meeting,  our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 8 percent,  raising it to $041 per share,  equivalent to a full year dividend of $164 per share in 2009.  This is our 47th consecutive annual increase.  Our annual common stock dividend was $152 per share,  $136 per share and $124 per share in 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  The 2008 dividend represented a 12 percent increase from 2007,  and the 2007 dividend represented a 10 percent increase from 2006.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with the definition under SEC rules,  the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:  any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit,  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;  any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and  any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,  liquidity,  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant,  or engages in leasing,  hedging or research and development services with the registrant.  As of December 31,  2008,  we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately $238 million.  These guarantees primarily are related to third-party customersbottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business.  These guarantees have various terms,  and none of these guarantees was individually significant.  The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however,  we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees.  Management concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable.  As of December 31,  2008we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity,  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.  Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December 31,  2008,  the Company is contractual obligations,  including payments due by period,  were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 
Short-term loans and notes payable1: Commercial paper borrowings Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings Current maturities of long-term debt2 Long-term debt,  net of current maturities2 Estimated interest payments3 Accrued income taxes4 Purchase obligations5 Marketing obligations6 Lease obligations Total contractual obligations4 1 
2014 and Thereafter 
Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable.  Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper,  we typically issue new commercial paper.  Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs,  especially at international subsidiaries.  Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long-term debt.  We will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt,  including the use of cash flows from operating activities,  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt.  We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term fixed-rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates.  We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.  Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes.  As of December 31,  2008,  the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability,  including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits,  was approximately $447 million,  which was not included in the total above.  At this time,  the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined.  In addition,  any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions.  The purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms,  including long-term contractual obligations,  open purchase orders,  accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities.  We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities.  We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.  
In accordance with SFAS No.  87,  ''Employers' Accounting for Pensions, ' and SFAS No.  106,  ''Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, ' as amended by SFAS No.  158,  ''Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No.  87,  88,  106,  and 132(R), ' the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31,  2008 was approximately $1620 million.  Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  This amount is impacted by,  among other items,  pension expense,  funding levels,  plan amendments,  changes in plan demographics and assumptions,  investment return on plan assets,  and the application of SFAS No.  158.  Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs,  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.  
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (''PPA') was enacted in August 2006 and established,  among other things,  new standards for funding of U.S.  defined benefit pension plans.  During 2008,  the funded status of the Company is primary U.S.  defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline.  In early 2009,  the Company contributed approximately $175 million to this plan.  Subsequent to this contributionthe plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the PPA.  However,  we will consider additional funding at a later date this year based on asset performance during the beginning of the year.  We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities.  Our international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations.  We do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in 2009 or thereafter.  Therefore,  no amounts have been included in the table above.  As of December 31,  2008,  the projected benefit obligation of the U.S.  qualified pension plans was $1918 million,  and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $1442 million.  The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets.  As of December 31,  2008,  the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S.  qualified pension plans was approximately $1700 million,  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately $848 million.  The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-U.S.  employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions,  as well as our unfunded U.S.  nonqualified pension plans.  These U.S.  nonqualified pension plans provide,  for certain associates,  benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above.  However,  we anticipate annual benefit payments to be approximately $40 million in 2009 and remain near that level through 2032,  decreasing annually thereafter.  Refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31,  2008 were approximately $914 million.  Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful.  Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases,  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts.  The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods.  As a result,  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading,  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.  On September 3,  2008,  we announced our intention to make cash offers to purchase Huiyuan.  Assuming full acceptance of the offers,  the transaction is valued at approximately $24 billion.  Refer to the heading ''Additional Information. ' This amount is excluded from the contractual obligations table,  because it is subject to preconditions relating to Chinese regulatory approvals.  As of December 31,  2008,  we have recorded approximately $383 million in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities for minority interests related to consolidated entities in which we do not have a 100 percent ownership interest.  Such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources; therefore,  this amount is excluded from the contractual obligations table.  Foreign Exchange Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks,  including currency fluctuations and governmental actions.  We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments,  and to fluctuations in foreign currencies.  
We use 70 functional currencies.  Due to our global operations,  weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others.  In 2008,  2007 and 2006,  the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies),  and for certain individual currencies,  strengthened (weakened) against the U.S.  dollar as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 
All operating currencies Brazilian real Mexican peso Australian dollar South African rand British pound Euro Japanese yen 
These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and,  therefore,  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results.  Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate,  over time,  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share.  The total currency impact on operating income,  including the effect of our hedging activities,  was an increase of approximately 6 percent in 2008 and an increase of approximately 4 percent in 2007.  The impact of a stronger U.S.  dollar reduced our operating income by approximately 1 percent in 2006.  Based on the anticipated benefits of hedging coverage in place,  the Company currently expects currencies to have a 10 percent to 12 percent negative impact on operating income in the first quarter of 2009.  The foreign exchange environment is very volatile,  and the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for subsequent periods.  Exchange gain (loss)—net was a gain of approximately $24 million in 2008,  and losses of approximately $10 million and $15 million in 2007 and 2006,  respectively.  These amounts were recorded in other income (loss)—net in our consolidated statements of income.  Exchange gain (loss)—net includes the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our consolidated balance sheets.  Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate,  over time,  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share.  Overview of Financial Position Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,  2008,  compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,  2007,  was impacted by the following:  a decrease in net assets of $2285 million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts;  an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $608 million,  primarily related to the timing of borrowings;  a decrease of $1637 million in our investment in CCE,  primarily due to our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by CCE;  a decrease of $942 million in other assets,  primarily due to the decline in fair value of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.  Prior to this decline in fair value,  the plan assets for certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the benefit obligation,  which resulted in the recognition of a prepaid asset.  The Company has now recognized a liability for these pension and other postretirement benefit plans; 
 an increase in our trademarks with indefinite lives of $906 million,  primarily related to the finalization of purchase accounting for glacéau and Fuze and the acquisition of brands and licenses from Carlsberg.  The increase in trademarks with indefinite lives related to the finalization of purchase accounting for glacéau resulted in a reclassification from goodwill; and  a decrease in deferred income taxes of $1013 million,  primarily related to the change in deferred taxes on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on our investment in CCE as a result of our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by CCE during 2008.  Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world.  In general,  we believe that,  over time,  we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.  Additional Information On September 3,  2008,  we announced our intention to make cash offers to purchase Huiyuan.  The making of the offers is subject to preconditions relating to Chinese regulatory approvals.  We are offering HK$1220 per share,  and making a comparable offer for outstanding convertible bonds and options.  We have accepted irrevocable undertakings from three shareholders for acceptance of the offers,  in aggregate representing approximately 66 percent of the Huiyuan shares,  and upon satisfaction of the preconditions the Company plans to commence a tender offer under Hong Kong securities laws for the remaining shares.  Assuming full acceptance of the offers,  the transaction is valued at approximately $24 billion.  
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity prices and other market risks.  We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  As a matter of policy,  all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure.  Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure,  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure.  The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however,  the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less.  Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward,  over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.  Foreign Exchange We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis,  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets.  In 2008,  we generated approximately 75 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside of the United States; therefore,  weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time.  We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations.  Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.  Additionally,  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities.  We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations.  Interest Rates We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt,  as well as our mix of short-term debt versus long-term debt.  From time to time,  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt.  Value-at-Risk We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems,  including value-at-risk models.  Our value-at-risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates.  We have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations.  We examined historical weekly returns over the previous 10 years to calculate our value-at-risk.  The average value-at-risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year.  As a result of our foreign currency value-at-risk calculations,  we estimate with 95 percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments,  over a one-week period,  would decline by not more than approximately $44 million,  $20 million and $14 million,  respectively,  using 2008,  2007 or 2006 average fair values,  and by not more than approximately $30 million and $19 million,  respectively,  using December 31,  2008 and 2007 fair values.  According to our interest rate value-at-risk calculations,  we estimate with 95 percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our 2008 average or in our December 31,  2008,  interest rates over a one-week period would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Our December 312007 and 2006 estimates also were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business The Coca-Cola Company is predominantly a manufacturer,  distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  We also manufacture,  distribute and market finished beverages.  In these notes,  the terms ''Company, ' ''we, ' ''us' or ''our' mean The Coca-Cola Company and all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements.  We primarily sell concentrates and syrups,  as well as finished beveragesto bottling and canning operations,  distributors,  fountain wholesalers and fountain retailers.  Our Company owns or licenses nearly 500 brands,  including Coca-Cola,  Diet Coke,  Fanta and Sprite,  and a variety of diet and light beverages,  waters,  enhanced waters,  juices and juice drinks,  teas,  coffees,  and energy and sports drinks.  Additionally,  we have ownership interests in numerous beverage joint ventures,  bottling and canning operations.  Significant markets for our products exist in all the world is geographic regions.  While we primarily manufacture,  market and sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners,  from time to time we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation,  often on a temporary basis.  Often,  though not always,  these acquired bottling operations are in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance.  Owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler is sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler is business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures.  Acquisitions and consolidation of controlled bottling operations during 2008 and 2007 have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of Company-owned bottling plants included in our consolidated financial statements and in the number of our associates.  In 2008net operating revenues generated by Company-owned and consolidated bottling operations (which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment) represented approximately 27 percent of our Company is consolidated net operating revenues and distributed approximately 11 percent of our worldwide unit case volume.  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our Company is the primary beneficiary.  Refer to the heading ''Variable Interest Entities, ' below,  for a discussion of variable interest entities.  We use the equity method to account for our investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies.  Consolidated net income includes our Company is proportionate share of the net income or net loss of these companies.  We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method,  as applicable.  Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value,  if the fair value of the security is readily determinable as defined by and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (''SFAS') No.  115,  ''Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. ' Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available-for-sale securities.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income.  Unrealized gains and losses,  net of deferred taxes,  on available-for-sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (''AOCI').  Trading securities are reported as marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets.  Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets,  depending on the length of time we intend to 77 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) hold the investment.  The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option as permitted by SFAS No.  159,  ''The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.  115, ' which provides entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting,  or for which the Company has not elected the fair value option,  are accounted for under the cost method.  In accordance with the cost method,  our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared.  Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets.  We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions,  including the intercompany transactions with variable interest entities and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.  Certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.  Variable Interest Entities Financial Accounting Standards Board (''FASB') Interpretation No.  46 (revised December 2003)''Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities' (''Interpretation No.  46(R)') addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition (ownership of a majority voting interest) of consolidation does not apply.  Interpretation No.  46(R) focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests.  It concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests,  a company is exposure (variable interest) to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity is assets and activities is the best evidence of control.  If an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity,  it would be considered the primary beneficiary.  Upon consolidation,  the primary beneficiary is generally required to include assets,  liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the variable interest as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest.  Our consolidated balance sheets include the assets and liabilities of the following:  all entities in which the Company has ownership of a majority of voting interests; and  all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary.  Our Company holds interests in certain entities,  primarily bottlers,  that are considered variable interest entities.  These variable interests relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support for these entities.  Our Company is investments,  plus any loans and guarantees,  related to these variable interest entities totaled approximately $604 million and $647 million at December 31,  2008 and 2007,  respectively,  representing our maximum exposures to loss.  Any creditors of the variable interest entities do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company as a result of including these variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements.  The Company is investment,  plus any loans and guarantees,  related to variable interest entities were not significant to the Company is consolidated financial statements.  In addition,  assets and liabilities of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary,  and thus are included in our consolidated balance sheets,  were not significant to the Company is consolidated financial statements.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future,  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions.  Furthermore,  when testing assets for impairment in future periods,  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur,  impairment charges may result.  Risks and Uncertainties Factors that could adversely impact the Company is operations or financial results include,  but are not limited to,  the following: obesity concerns; water scarcity and quality; changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment; the global credit crisis; increased competition; inability to expand operations in developing and emerging markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange; interest rate increases; inability to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners; a deterioration in our bottling partners' financial condition; strikes or work stoppages (including at key manufacturing locations); increased cost,  disruption of supply or shortage of energy; increased cost,  disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients or packaging materials; changes in laws and regulations relating to our business,  including those regarding beverage containers and packaging; additional labeling or warning requirements; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and international markets; changes in commercial and market practices within the European Economic Area; litigation or legal proceedings; adverse weather conditions; an inability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation; changes in the legal and regulatory environment in various countries in which we operate; changes in accounting and taxation standards,  including an increase in tax rates; an inability to achieve our overall long-term goals; an inability to protect our information systems; future impairment charges; an inability to successfully manage our Company-owned bottling operations; climate change; and global or regional catastrophic events.  Our Company monitors our operations with a view to minimizing the impact to our overall business that could arise as a result of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business.  Revenue Recognition Our Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  delivery of products has occurred,  the sales price charged is fixed or determinable,  and collectibility is reasonably assured.  For our Company,  this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners,  resellers or other customers.  In particular,  title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers' locations,  as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions.  Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.  In addition,  our customers can earn certain incentives,  which are included in deductions from revenue,  a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.  These incentives include,  but are not limited to,  cash discounts,  funds for promotional and marketing activities,  volume-based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs (refer to the heading ''Other Assets').  The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs,  including amortization expense on infrastructure initiatives,  was approximately $44 billion,  $41 billion and $38 billion for the years 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  In preparing the financial statements,  management must make estimates related to the contractual terms,  customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue.  Management also considers past results in making such estimates.  The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates.  Advertising Costs Our Company expenses production costs of print,  radio,  television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place.  Advertising costs included in selling,  general and administrative expenses were approximately $30 billion,  $28 billion and $26 billion for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  As of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  advertising and production costs of approximately $195 million and $224 million,  respectively,  were recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  Stock-Based Compensation Our Company currently sponsors stock option plans and restricted stock award plans.  Refer to Note 15.  Effective January 1,  2006,  the Company adopted SFAS No.  123 (revised 2004),  ''Share Based Payment' (''SFAS No.  123(R)').  Our Company adopted SFAS No.  123(R) using the modified prospective method.  Based on the terms of our plans,  our Company did not have a cumulative effect related to our plans.  The adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) did not have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31,  2006.  The fair values of the stock awards are determined using an estimated expected life.  The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period the award is earned by the employee.  Our equity method investees also adopted SFAS No.  123(R) effective January 1,  2006.  Our proportionate share of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) by our equity method investees is recognized as a reduction of equity income.  The adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) by our equity method investees did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Income Taxes Income tax expense includes United States,  state,  local and international income taxes,  plus a provision for U.S.  taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.  The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.  On January 1,  2007,  the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No.  48,  ''Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes' (''Interpretation No.  48') to account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company is financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.  109,  ''Accounting for Income Taxes. ' Refer to Note 17.  Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.  Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) basic net income per share,  except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised.  Approximately 59 million,  71 million and 175 million stock option awards were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share in 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively,  because the awards would have been antidilutive for the periods presented.  Cash Equivalents We classify marketable securities that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents.  We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards,  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our credit risk concentrations.  We have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better.  We monitor counterparty exposures daily and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately.  Trade Accounts Receivable We record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts.  We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offsthe level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables,  and our relationships with,  and the economic status of,  our bottling partners and customers.  Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31 2008 
Balance,  beginning of year Net charges to costs and expenses Write-offs Other1 
Balance,  end of year 
Other includes acquisitions,  divestitures and currency translation.  
 significant portion of our net operating revenues is derived from sales of our products in international markets.  Refer to Note 21.  We also generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to bottlers in which we have a noncontrolling interest,  including Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  (''CCE'),  Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.  (''Coca-Cola Hellenic'),  Coca-Cola FEMSA,  S. A. B.  de C. V.  (''Coca-Cola FEMSA') and Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (''Coca-Cola Amatil').  Refer to Note 3.  Inventories Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which includes ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate and foodservice operations,  and finished beverages in our bottling and canning operations).  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  We determine cost on the basis of the average cost or first-in,  first-out methods.  Refer to Note 2.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recoverability of Investments in Equity and Debt Securities We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment.  When such events or changes occur,  we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment.  We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period.  The fair values of most of our Company is investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices.  For investments in nonpublicly traded companies,  management is assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows,  estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals,  as appropriate.  We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.  In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis,  management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary.  If management determines the decline is other than temporary,  an impairment charge is recorded.  Management is assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on,  among other things,  the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis,  the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  Refer to Note 10.  Other Assets Our Company advances payments to certain customers for marketing to fund future activities intended to generate profitable volume,  and we expense such payments over the applicable period.  Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights.  Additionally,  our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.  When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverablemanagement assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  Costs of these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and noncurrent other assets and are amortized over the remaining periods directly benefitedwhich range from 1 to 10 years.  Amortization expense for infrastructure programs was approximately $162 million,  $151 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  Refer to heading ''Revenue Recognition' above,  and Note 3.  Property,  Plant and Equipment Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.  Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets,  which generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; machinery and equipment: 15 years or less; and containers: 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 10 years or less.  Land is not depreciated,  and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term,  including renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured,  or the estimated useful life of the improvement.  Depreciation expense,  including the depreciation expense of assets under capital lease,  totaled approximately $993 million,  $958 million and $763 million for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled approximately $19 million$21 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  Refer to Note 4.  Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property,  plant and equipment should be assessed,  including,  among others,  a significant decrease in market value,  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market,  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses.  When such events or changes in circumstances are present,  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property,  plant and equipment,  including appraisals and discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  Goodwill,  Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No.  142,  ''Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, ' we classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill.  For intangible assets with definite lives,  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill,  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.  Our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of intangible assets and/or goodwill.  If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees,  the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge.  However,  the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences,  deferred taxes and deferred gains.  When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets determined to have definite lives may not be recoverable,  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows.  These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning.  If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount,  we recognize an impairment loss.  The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets,  including discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives,  including trademarks,  franchise rights and goodwill,  for impairment annually,  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.  We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) intangible assets,  including,  but not limited to,  discounted cash flow models,  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  For indefinite-lived intangible assetsother than goodwill,  if the fair value is less than the carrying amount,  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level,  which is one level below our operating segments.  The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process,  if necessary.  The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value,  including goodwill.  We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit.  The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value,  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss,  if any.  The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill,  which is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.  Impairment charges related to intangible assets are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or,  to the extent they relate to equity method investees,  as a reduction of equity income (loss)—net in the consolidated statements of income.  Our Company determines the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset.  Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement,  the history of the asset,  the Company is long-term strategy for the use of the asset,  any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset,  and other economic factors,  including competition and specific market conditions.  Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized,  primarily on a straight-line basis,  over their useful lives,  generally ranging from 1 to 20 years.  Refer to Note 5.  Derivative Financial Instruments Our Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No.  133,  ''Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, ' as amended by SFAS No.  137,  ''Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.  133—an amendment of FASB Statement No.  133, ' SFAS No.  138,  ''Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No.  133, ' and SFAS No.  149,  ''Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. ' We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets,  with fair values of foreign currency derivatives estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.  Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as investing activities.  Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest,  commodity or currency exposures are classified as operating activities.  Refer to Note 11.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Retirement-Related Benefits Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions,  our Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No.  87,  ''Employers' Accounting for Pensions, ' and we account for our nonpension postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No.  106,  ''Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, ' as amended by SFAS No.  158,  ''Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No.  87,  88,  106and 132(R). ' Effective December 31,  2006 for our Company,  SFAS No.  158 required that previously unrecognized actuarial gains or losses,  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations or assets be recognized generally through adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income and credits to prepaid benefit cost or accrued benefit liability.  As a result of these adjustments,  the current funded status of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is reflected in the Company is consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,  2008 and 2007.  Refer to Note 16.  Our equity method investees also adopted SFAS No.  158 effective December 31,  2006.  Refer to Note 3 for the impact on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from the adoption of SFAS No.  158 by our equity method investees.  Contingencies Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters.  Due to their nature,  such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including,  but not limited to,  court rulingsnegotiations between affected parties and governmental actions.  Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances,  as appropriate.  Refer to Note 13.  Business Combinations In accordance with SFAS No.  141,  ''Business Combinations, ' we account for all business combinations by the purchase method.  Furthermore,  we recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or legal rights or if they are separable from goodwill.  Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  141 (revised 2007),  ''Business Combinations. ' SFAS No.  141(R) amends the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,  the liabilities assumed,  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired.  SFAS No.  141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination.  SFAS No.  141(R) is effective for our Company on January 1,  2009,  and the Company will apply SFAS No.  141(R) prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact that the adoption of SFAS No.  141(R) will have on our consolidated financial statements,  which mainly depends on the size and nature of business combinations completed after the date of adoption.  In December 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  160,  ' Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No.  51. ' SFAS No.  160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) SFAS No.  160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent is equity,  rather than in liabilities or the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity.  In addition,  SFAS No.  160 establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the controlling and noncontrolling interests and require the separate disclosure of income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests.  SFAS No.  160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,  2008.  Other than the reclassification of noncontrolling interests as described above,  the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No.  160 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In December 2007,  the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (''EITF') Issue No.  07-1,  ''Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements. ' EITF 07-1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties.  It also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants,  as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements.  EITF 07-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 152008.  The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 07-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2007,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  159,  ''The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.  115. ' SFAS No.  159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.  SFAS No.  159 was effective for our Company on January 1,  2008.  The adoption of SFAS No.  159 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In September 2006,  the SEC staff published SAB No.  108,  ''Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. ' SAB No.  108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements,  specifically,  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements.  SAB No.  108 was effective for fiscal years ending after November 15,  2006.  The adoption of SAB No.  108 by our Company in the fourth quarter of 2006 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  As previously discussed,  our Company adopted SFAS No.  158 related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.  Refer to Note 16.  In September 2006,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  157,  ''Fair Value Measurements. ' SFAS No.  157 defines fair value,  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.  SFAS No.  157 was effective for our Company on January 1,  2008.  However,  in February 2008,  the FASB released a FASB Staff Position (FSP FAS 157-2—Effective Date of FASB Statement No.  157) which delayed the effective date of SFAS No.  157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).  The adoption of SFAS No.  157 for our financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact upon adoption.  We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No.  157 for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities,  effective January 1,  2009,  will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In July 2006,  the FASB issued Interpretation No.  48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise is financial statements in accordance with SFAS No.  109,  ''Accounting for 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Income Taxes. ' Interpretation No.  48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Interpretation No.  48 also provides guidance on derecognition,  classification,  interest and penalties,  accounting in interim periods,  disclosure and transition.  For our Company,  Interpretation No.  48 was effective January 12007.  As a result of the adoption of Interpretation No.  48,  we recorded an approximate $65 million increase in accrued income taxes in our consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits,  which was accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the January 1,  2007 balance of reinvested earnings.  Refer to Note 17.  As previously discussed,  our Company adopted SFAS No.  123(R) related to share based payments effective January 1,  2006.  Refer to Note 15.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  CCE is a marketer,  producer and distributor of bottle and can nonalcoholic beverages,  operating in eight countries.  As of December 31,  2008,  our Company owned approximately 35 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE.  We account for our investment by the equity method of accounting and,  therefore,  our net income includes our proportionate share of CCE is net income or loss.

Syrup and finished product purchases from CCE represent purchases of fountain syrup in certain territories that have been resold by our Company to major customers and purchases of bottle and can products.  Marketing payments made by us directly to CCE represent support of certain marketing activities and our participation with CCE in cooperative advertising and other marketing activities to promote the sale of Company trademark 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS (Continued) products within CCE territories.  These programs are agreed to on an annual basis.  Marketing payments made to third parties on behalf of CCE represent support of certain marketing activities and programs to promote the sale of Company trademark products within CCE is territories in conjunction with certain of CCE is customers.  Pursuant to cooperative advertising and trade agreements with CCE,  we received funds from CCE for local media and marketing program reimbursements.  Payments made to CCE for dispensing equipment repair services represent reimbursement to CCE for its costs of parts and labor for repairs on cooler,  dispensing,  or post-mix equipment owned by us or our customers.  The other payments—net line in the table above represents payments made to and received from CCE that are individually not significant.  In 2008,  we recorded our proportionate share of approximately $76 billion pretax ($49 billion after-tax) of charges recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2008.  The Company is proportionate share of these charges was approximately $16 billion.  The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE is North American franchise rights during the second quarter was the result of several factors including,  but not limited to,  (1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher-margin packages and certain higher-margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum,  high fructose corn syrup (''HFCS') and resin; and (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs.  The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE is North American franchise rights during the fourth quarter was primarily driven by financial market conditions as of the measurement date that caused (1) a dramatic increase in market debt rateswhich impacted the capital charge,  and (2) a significant decline in the funded status of CCE is defined benefit pension plans.  In addition,  the market price of CCE is common stock declined by more than 50 percent between the date of CCE is interim impairment test (May 23,  2008) and the date of CCE is annual impairment test (October 24,  2008).  Our proportionate share of these charges was recorded to equity income (loss)—net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment.  In addition to the charges discussed above,  our Company reduced equity income (loss)—net in our consolidated statement of income by approximately $30 million in 2008,  primarily due to our proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by CCE.  Our proportionate share of these charges impacted the Bottling Investments operating segment.  As discussed above,  in accordance with the equity method of accounting,  we record our proportionate share of net income or loss from equity method investees.  When we record our proportionate share of net income,  it increases our carrying value in that investment.  Conversely,  when we record our proportionate share of a net loss,  it decreases our carrying value in that investment.  Additionally,  the equity method of accounting requires the investor to record its proportionate share of items impacting the equity investee is AOCI.  During 2008,  the carrying value of our investment in CCE was reduced by our proportionate share of CCE is net loss and items impacting AOCI.  CCE is net loss was primarily attributable to the impairment charges discussed above.  CCE also recorded significant adjustments to AOCI,  primarily related to an increase in its pension liability determined in accordance with SFAS No.  158 and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  As a result of CCE is net loss and adjustments to AOCI,  our Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in CCE to zero as of December 31,  2008.  In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,  once the carrying value of an equity investment is reduced to zero,  the investor is proportionate share of net losses and items impacting AOCI is required to be recorded as a reduction to advances made from the investor to the investee.  As a result,  the Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in infrastructure programs with CCE.  Our Company will continue to amortize its investment in these infrastructure programs based on our original investment; therefore,  this adjustment will have no impact on the amortization expense related to these 89 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS (Continued) infrastructure programs.  The carrying value of our equity investment in CCE will not be adjusted until we have restored our basis in these infrastructure programs.  In 2007,  our equity income related to CCE was increased by approximately $11 million related to our proportionate share of certain items recorded by CCE.  Our proportionate share of these items included an approximate $35 million increase to equity income,  primarily related to tax benefits recorded by CCE.  This increase was partially offset by an approximate $24 million decrease to equity income,  primarily related to restructuring charges recorded by CCE.  In 2006,  our Company is equity income related to CCE decreased by approximately $587 million,  related to our proportionate share of certain items recorded by CCE.  Our proportionate share of these items included approximately $602 million resulting from the impact of an impairment charge recorded by CCE.  CCE recorded a $29 billion pretax ($18 billion after-tax) impairment of its North American franchise rights.  The decline in the estimated fair value of CCE is North American franchise rights was the result of several factors,  including but not limited to (1) CCE is revised outlook on 2007 raw material costs driven by significant increases in aluminum and HFCS; (2) a challenging marketplace environment with increased pricing pressures in several high-growth beverage categories; and (3) increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate and corresponding capital charge.  Our proportionate share of CCE is charges also included approximately $18 million due to restructuring charges recorded by CCE.  These charges were partially offset by approximately $33 million related to our proportionate share of changes in certain of CCE is state and Canadian federal and provincial tax rates.  All of these charges and changes impacted our Bottling Investments operating segment.  Our Company and CCE have established a Global Marketing Fund,  under which we expect to pay CCE $62 million annually through December 31,  2014,  as support for certain marketing activities.  The term of the agreement will automatically be extended for successive 10-year periods thereafter unless either party gives written notice of termination of this agreement.  The marketing activities to be funded under this agreement will be agreed upon each year as part of the annual joint planning process and will be incorporated into the annual marketing plans of both companies.  These amounts are included in the line item marketing payments made by us directly to CCE in the table above.  Our Company previously entered into programs with CCE designed to help develop cold-drink infrastructure.  Under these programs,  our Company paid CCE for a portion of the cost of developing the infrastructure necessary to support accelerated placements of cold-drink equipment.  These payments support a common objective of increased sales of Company trademark beverages from increased availability and consumption in the cold-drink channel.  In connection with these programs,  CCE agreed to: (1) purchase and place specified numbers of Company-approved cold-drink equipment each year through 2010; (2) maintain the equipment in service,  with certain exceptions,  for a period of at least 12 years after placement; (3) maintain and stock the equipment in accordance with specified standards; and (4) annual reporting to our Company of minimum average annual unit case volume throughout the economic life of the equipment and other specified information.  CCE must achieve minimum average unit case volume for a 12-year period following the placement of equipment.  These minimum average unit case volume levels ensure adequate gross profit from sales of 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS (Continued) concentrate to fully recover the capitalized costs plus a return on the Company is investment.  Should CCE fail to purchase the specified numbers of cold-drink equipment for any calendar year through 2010,  the parties agreed to mutually develop a reasonable solution.  Should no mutually agreeable solution be developed,  or in the event that CCE otherwise breaches any material obligation under the contracts and such breach is not remedied within a stated period,  then CCE would be required to repay a portion of the support funding as determined by our Company.  In the third quarter of 2004,  our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract to defer the placement of some equipment from 2004 and 2005,  as previously agreed under the original contract,  to 2009 and 2010.  In connection with this amendment,  CCE agreed to pay the Company approximately $2 million in 2004$3 million annually in 2005 through 2008,  and $1 million in 2009.  In 2005,  our Company and CCE agreed to amend the contract for North America to move to a system of purchase and placement credits,  whereby CCE earns credit toward its annual purchase and placement requirements based upon the type of equipment it purchases and places.  The amended contract also provides that no breach by CCE will occur even if it does not achieve the required number of purchase and placement credits in any given year,  so long as (1) the shortfall does not exceed 20 percent of the required purchase and placement credits for that year; (2) a compensating payment is made to our Company by CCE; (3) the shortfall is corrected in the following year; and (4) CCE meets all specified purchase and placement credit requirements by the end of 2010.  The payments we made to CCE under these programs are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets and in noncurrent other assets and amortized as deductions from revenues over the 10-year period following the placement of the equipment.  The amortizable carrying values for these infrastructure programs with CCE were approximately $388 million and $494 million as of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  respectively.  The Company has no further commitments under these programs.  On January 1,  2008,  CCE adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No.  158,  which require entities to measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of their fiscal year end.  SFAS No.  158 requires a cumulative adjustment to be made to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  We reduced the beginning balance of our retained earnings and our investment basis in CCE by approximately $8 million for our proportionate share of CCE is adjustment.  Refer to Note 9 and Note 16.  Effective December 31,  2006,  CCE adopted all of the requirements of SFAS No.  158,  with the exception of the measurement provisions.  Our proportionate share of the impact of CCE is adoption of SFAS No.  158 was an approximate $132 million pretax ($84 million after-tax) reduction in both the carrying value of our investment in CCE and our AOCI.  Refer to Note 9 and Note 16.  If valued at the December 31,  2008 quoted closing price of CCE shares,  the fair value of our investment in CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately $20 billion.  Other Equity Method Investments Our other equity method investments include our ownership interests in Coca-Cola Hellenic,  Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Amatil.  As of December 31,  2008,  we owned approximately 23 percent,  32 percent and 30 percent,  respectively,  of these companies' common shares.  Operating results include our proportionate share of income (loss) from our equity method investments.  As of December 31,  2008,  our investment in our equity method investees in the aggregate,  other than CCEexceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity method investees by approximately $984 million.  This difference is not amortized.

Refer to Note 19.  Equity income in 2007 was reduced by approximately $99 million in the Bottling Investments operating segment related to our proportionate share of asset write-downs recorded by Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines,  Inc.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3: BOTTLING INVESTMENTS (Continued) 8 percent of the capital stock of Coca-Cola FEMSA to FEMSA.  As a result of this sale,  which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006,  the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $427 million and realized a gain of approximately $175 million,  which was recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other income (loss)—net and impacted the Corporate operating segment.

In 2006,  our Company sold a portion of our investment in Coca-Cola Icecek,  an equity method investee bottler incorporated in Turkey,  in an initial public offering.  Our Company received cash proceeds of approximately $198 million and realized a gain of approximately $123 million,  which was recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item other income (loss)—net and impacted the Corporate operating segment.  As a result of this public offering,  our Company is interest in Coca-Cola Icecek decreased from approximately 36 percent to approximately 20 percent.  Refer to Note 19.  Effective December 31,  2006,  our equity method investees other than CCE,  also adopted SFAS No.  158.  Our proportionate share of the impact of the adoption of SFAS No.  158 by our equity method investees other than CCE was an approximate $18 million pretax ($12 million after tax) reduction in the carrying value of our investments in those equity method investees and our AOCI.  Refer to Note 9 and Note 16.  If valued at the December 31,  2008,  quoted closing prices of shares actively traded on stock markets,  the value of our equity method investments in publicly traded bottlers other than CCE would have exceeded our carrying value by approximately $24 billion.  As of December 31,  2008,  the carrying value of the Company is investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic exceeded its fair value by approximately $256 million.  The carrying value has exceeded its fair value in each of the last three months of 2008; however,  the amount by which our carrying value has exceeded its fair value has decreased in each of those three months.  As is the case with most of our equity method investees,  we have both the ability and intent to hold our investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic as a long-term investment.  Furthermore,  under the terms of a shareholders agreement between the Company and another significant shareholder of Coca-Cola Hellenic,  the Company is required,  unless both parties agree to the contrary,  to maintain no less than a 20 percent ownership interest in Coca-Cola Hellenic through at least December 31,  2018.  Additionally,  we believe that the countries in which Coca-Cola Hellenic has bottling and distribution rights,  through direct ownership or joint ventures,  have positive growth opportunities.  We also believe that the recent volatility of Coca-Cola Hellenic is fair value is at least partly attributable to the volatility in the global financial markets and not necessarily indicative of a change in long-term value.  Based on these factors,  management has concluded that the decline in fair value of our investment in Coca-Cola Hellenic is temporary in nature.  We will continue to monitor our investment in future periods.  Net Receivables and Dividends from Equity Method Investees The total amount of net receivables due from equity method investees,  including CCE,  was approximately $823 million and $933 million as of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  respectively.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,  receivables,  accounts payable and accrued expensesand loans and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments.  We carry our cost method investments at cost.  If a decline in the fair value of a cost method investment is determined to be other than temporary,  an impairment charge is recorded and the fair value becomes the new cost basis of the investment.  We evaluate all of our cost method investments for impairment; however,  we are not required to determine the fair value of our investment unless impairment indicators are present.  When impairment indicators exist,  we generally use discounted cash flow analyses to determine the fair value.  We estimate that the fair values of cost method investments approximate their carrying amounts.  As of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  our cost method investments had a carrying value of approximately $176 million and $119 million,  respectively.  We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets,  with fair values estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.  Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward,  over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.  For further discussion of our derivatives,  including a disclosure of derivative values,  refer to Note 11 and Note 12.  The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments.  As of December 31,  2008,  the carrying amounts and fair values of our long-term debt,  including the current portion,  were approximately $3246 million and $3402 million,  respectively.  As of December 31,  2007,  these carrying amounts and fair values were approximately $3410 million and $3416 million,  respectively.  NOTE 11: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS When deemed appropriate,  our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity prices and other market risks.  The Company formally designates and documents the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure,  as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions.  The Company formally assesses,  both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter,  whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure.  Because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged,  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged.  Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument is change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.  Our Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  The fair values of derivatives used to hedge or modify our risks fluctuate over time,  and are determined in accordance with SFAS No.  157.  Refer to Note 12.  We do not view these fair value amounts in isolation,  but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures.  The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and,  therefore,  are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above.  The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivativessuch as interest rates,  foreign currency exchange rates or other financial indices.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 11: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Our Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and,  further,  on the type of hedging relationship.  At the inception of the hedging relationship,  the Company must designate the instrument as a fair value hedge,  a cash flow hedge,  or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.  This designation is based upon the exposure being hedged.  We have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better.  We monitor counterparty exposures daily and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately.  If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur,  we have provisions requiring collateral in the form of U.S.  government securities for substantially all of our transactions.  To mitigate presettlement risk,  minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases.  To minimize the concentration of credit risk,  we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions.  The Company has master netting agreements with most of the financial institutions that are counterparties to the derivative instruments.  These agreements allow for the net settlement of assets and liabilities arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.  Based on these factors,  we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.  Interest Rate Management Our Company monitors our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt versus long-term debt.  This monitoring includes a review of business and other financial risks.  From time to time,  in anticipation of future debt issuances,  we may manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.  During 2008,  the Company discontinued a cash flow hedging relationship on interest rate locks,  as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long-term debt for which these hedges were designated.  As a result,  the Company reclassified a previously unrecognized gain of approximately $17 million from AOCI to earnings as a reduction to interest expense.  Additionally,  during 2008 the Company recognized losses of approximately $9 million related to the portion of cash flow hedges deemed to be ineffective as an increase to interest expense.  Any ineffective portion,  which was not significant,  of these instruments during 2007 and 2006 was immediately recognized in net income.  Foreign Currency Management The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to reduce the risk that our eventual U.S.  dollar net cash inflows resulting from sales outside the United States will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  We enter into forward exchange contracts and purchase foreign currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these contracts,  which have been designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges,  was reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The Company did not discontinue any foreign currency cash flow hedging relationships during the years ended December 312008,  2007 and 2006.  Any ineffective portion,  which was not significant in 2008,  2007 or 2006,  of the change in the fair value of these instruments was immediately recognized in net income.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 11: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Additionally,  the Company enters into forward exchange contracts that are effective economic hedges and are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No.  133.  These instruments are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in foreign currency exchange rates on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  Changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss)—net in our consolidated statements of income to offset the effect of remeasurement of the monetary assets and liabilities.  The Company also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment position in certain major currencies.  Under SFAS No.  133,  changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment,  a component of AOCI,  to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged.  For the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  we recorded net gain (loss) in foreign currency translation adjustment related to those instruments of approximately $3 million,  $(7) million and $3 million,  respectively.  Commodities The Company enters into commodity futures and other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks.  We purchase commodity futures to hedge forecasted cash flows related to future purchases of certain commodities.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value for these contracts,  which have been designated as commodity cash flow hedges,  are reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The Company did not discontinue any commodity cash flow hedging relationships during the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006.  Any ineffective portion,  which was not significant in 2008,  2007 or 2006,  of the change in the fair value of these instruments was immediately recognized in net income.  The following tables present the carrying values,  fair values and maturities of the Company is derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31,  2008 and 2007 (in millions):

The Company estimates the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates,  and records them as prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets.  The amounts recorded reflect the effect of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.  As of December 31,  2008,  we had approximately $5 million reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets and $211 million reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Refer to Note 12.  Summary of AOCI For the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 and 2006,  we recorded a net gain (loss) to AOCI of approximately $(6) million,  $(59) million and $(31) million,  respectively,  net of both income taxes and reclassifications to earnings,  primarily related to gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges.  These items will generally offset the variability of the cash flows relating to the underlying exposures being hedged in future periods.  The Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months losses of approximately $31 million from the after-tax amount recorded in AOCI as of December 31,  2008,  as the anticipated cash flows occur.

NOTE 12: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Effective January 1,  2008,  the Company adopted SFAS No.  157,  which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1,  2009,  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis.  SFAS No.  157 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:  Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1,  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 12: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)  Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  This includes certain pricing models,  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.  The Company is adoption of SFAS No.  157 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  The Company has segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date in the table below.  Effective January 1,  2008,  the Company adopted SFAS No.  159,  which provides entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Entities that choose the fair value option will recognize unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option was elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.  The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option for any items that are not already required to be measured at fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,  2008,  are summarized below (in millions):

NOTE 13: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As of December 31,  2008,  we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately $238 million.  These guarantees primarily are related to third-party customersbottlers and vendors and have arisen through the normal course of business.  These guarantees have various terms,  and none of these guarantees was individually significant.  The amount represents the maximum potential 
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 13: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however,  we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees.  On September 3,  2008,  we announced our intention to make cash offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited,  a Hong Kong listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business throughout China (''Huiyuan').  The making of the offers is subject to preconditions relating to Chinese regulatory approvals.  We are offering HK$1220 per share,  and making a comparable offer for outstanding convertible bonds and options.  We have accepted irrevocable undertakings from three shareholders for acceptance of the offers,  in aggregate representing approximately 66 percent of the Huiyuan shares,  and upon satisfaction of the preconditions the Company plans to commence a tender offer under Hong Kong securities laws for the remaining shares.  Assuming full acceptance of the offers,  the transaction is valued at approximately $24 billion.  We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings.  We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made.  Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.  During the period from 1970 to 1981,  our Company owned Aqua-Chem,  Inc.,  now known as CleaverBrooks,  Inc.  (''Aqua-Chem').  A division of Aqua-Chem manufactured certain boilers that contained gaskets that Aqua-Chem purchased from outside suppliers.  Several years after our Company sold this entity,  Aqua-Chem received its first lawsuit relating to asbestos,  a component of some of the gaskets.  In September 2002Aqua-Chem notified our Company that it believed we were obligated for certain costs and expenses associated with its asbestos litigations.  Aqua-Chem demanded that our Company reimburse it for approximately $10 million for out-of-pocket litigation-related expenses.  Aqua-Chem also demanded that the Company acknowledge a continuing obligation to Aqua-Chem for any future liabilities and expenses that are excluded from coverage under the applicable insurance or for which there is no insurance.  Our Company disputes Aqua-Chem is claims,  and we believe we have no obligation to Aqua-Chem for any of its past,  present or future liabilities,  costs or expenses.  Furthermore,  we believe we have substantial legal and factual defenses to Aqua-Chem is claims.  The parties entered into litigation in Georgia to resolve this dispute,  which was stayed by agreement of the parties pending the outcome of litigation filed in Wisconsin by certain insurers of Aqua-Chem.  In that case,  five plaintiff insurance companies filed a declaratory judgment action against Aqua-Chem,  the Company and 16 defendant insurance companies seeking a determination of the parties' rights and liabilities under policies issued by the insurers and reimbursement for amounts paid by plaintiffs in excess of their obligations.  During the course of the Wisconsin coverage litigation,  Aqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers,  including plaintiffs,  who have or will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem.  On July 24,  2007,  the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers,  which judgment was not appealed.  The judgment directs,  among other things,  that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for one-hundred percent of Aqua-Chem is losses up to policy limits.  The Georgia litigation remains subject to the stay agreement.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 13: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) The Company has had discussions with the Competition Directorate of the European Commission (the ''European Commission') about issues relating to parallel trade within the European Union arising out of comments received by the European Commission from third parties.  The Company has fully cooperated with the European Commission and has provided information on these issues and the measures taken and to be taken to address them.  The Company is unable to predict at this time with any reasonable degree of certainty what action,  if any,  the European Commission will take with respect to these issues.  At the time we acquire or divest our interest in an entity,  we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities.  Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole.  The Company is involved in various tax matters,  with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain.  We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  (2) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  but for a lesser amountor (3) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.  For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain,  (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information,  (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes,  legislative intent,  regulations,  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position,  and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken.  A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised.  The number of years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the ''more likely than not' recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is ''more likely than not' to be sustained,  (2) the tax position,  amount,  and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation,  or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired.  Refer to Note 17.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 15: STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS Effective January 1,  2006,  the Company adopted SFAS No.  123(R) using the modified prospective method.  Based on the terms of our plans,  our Company did not have a cumulative effect related to its adoption.  The adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) did not have a material impact on our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31,  2006.  Prior to 2006,  our Company accounted for stock option plans and restricted stock plans under the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.  123.  Additionally,  our equity method investees also adopted SFAS No.  123(R) effective January 1,  2006.  Our proportionate share of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) by our equity method investees is recognized as a reduction to equity income.  The adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) by our equity method investees did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Our total stock-based compensation expense was approximately $266 million,  $313 million and $324 million in 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  These amounts were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.  The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was approximately $72 million,  $91 million and $93 million for 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  As of December 31,  2008,  we had approximately $368 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our plans.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 years as stockbased compensation expense.  This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.  Stock Option Plans Under our 1991 Stock Option Plan (the ''1991 Option Plan'),  a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred,  through the grant of stock options,  to certain officers and employees.  Options to purchase common stock under the 1991 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant.  The 1999 Stock Option Plan (the ''1999 Option Plan') was approved by shareowners in April 1999.  Under the 1999 Option Plan,  a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred,  through the grant of stock options,  to certain officers and employees.  Options to purchase common stock under the 1999 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant.  The 2002 Stock Option Plan (the ''2002 Option Plan') was approved by shareowners in April 2002.  An amendment to the 2002 Option Plan which permitted the issuance of stock appreciation rights was approved by shareowners in April 2003.  Under the 2002 Option Plan,  a maximum of 120 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred,  through the grant of stock options or stock appreciation rights,  to certain officers and employees.  No stock appreciation rights have been issued under the 2002 Option Plan as of December 31,  2008.  Options to purchase common stock under the 2002 Option Plan have been granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant.  The 2008 Stock Option Plan (the ''2008 Option Plan') was approved by shareowners in April 2008.  Under the 2008 Option Plan,  a maximum of 140 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred to certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options granted under the 2008 Option Plan.  Options to purchase common stock under the 2008 Option Plan have been generally granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 15: STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued) Stock options granted in December 2003 and thereafter generally become exercisable over four years (with approximately 25 percent of the total grant vesting each year on the anniversary of the grant date) and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  Stock options granted from 1999 through July 2003 generally became exercisable over four years and expire 15 years from the date of grant.  Prior to 1999,  stock options generally became exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  The 1999 Stock Option Plan and the 2002 Stock Option Plan have been amended to provide a maximum option term of 10 years for all grants in 2008 and beyond.  The 2008 Option Plan provides a maximum option term of 10 years.  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton optionpricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.  The expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historic exercise behavior.  Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company is stock,  historical volatility of the Company is stock,  and other factors.  The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the option is based on the U.S.  Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.  The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the Company is stock at the time of the grant.  The shares of common stock to be issued,  transferred and/or sold under the stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued Company common stock or from the Company is treasury shares.  In 2007,  the Company began issuing common stock under these plans from the Company is treasury shares.  The following table sets forth information about the weighted-average fair value of options granted during the past three years and the weighted-average assumptions used for such grants: 2008

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 15: STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued) Restricted Stock Award Plans Under the amended 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan and the amended 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the ''Restricted Stock Award Plans'),  40 million and 24 million shares of restricted common stock,  respectivelywere originally available to be granted to certain officers and key employees of our Company.  As of December 31,  2008,  approximately 25 million shares remain available for grant under the Restricted Stock Award Plans,  when all outstanding awards including promises to grant restricted stock and performance share units at the target level are included.  For time-based and performance-based restricted stock awardsparticipants are entitled to vote and receive dividends on the restricted shares.  For performance share unitsparticipants generally only receive dividends or dividend equivalents once the performance criteria has been certified and the restricted stock or promises to grant restricted stock have been issued.  For awards prior to January 1,  2008 under the 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan,  participants are reimbursed by our Company for income taxes imposed on the award,  but not for taxes generated by the reimbursement payment.  The Company has not granted awards from the 1983 Restricted Stock Plan since 1993.  The 1983 Restricted Stock Plan has been amended to eliminate this tax reimbursement for awards after January 1,  2008.  The shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and may be forfeited if a participant leaves our Company for reasons other than retirement,  disability or death,  absent a change in control of our Company.  The following awards were outstanding and nonvested as of December 31,  2008:  474478 shares of time-based restricted stock and promises to grant restricted stock in which the restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified period of time;  298009 shares of performance-based restricted stock and promises to grant restricted stock in which restrictions lapse upon the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified performance period;  4533736 performance share units which could result in a future grant of restricted stock after the achievement of specific performance goals over a specified performance period.  Such awards are subject to adjustment based on the final performance relative to the goals,  resulting in a minimum grant of no shares and a maximum grant of 7011354 shares; and  709808 shares of restricted stock and promises to grant restricted stock from conversion of performance share units.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards that are subject to performance criteria,  when it is probable that the performance criteria specified in the plan will be achieved.  The compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period and is recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.

These awards are similar to time-based restricted stock,  including the payment of dividend equivalents,  but were granted in this manner because the employees were based outside of the United States.  
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards In 2001,  shareowners approved an amendment to the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan to allow for the grant of performance-based awards.  These awards are released only upon the achievement of specific measurable performance criteria.  These awards pay dividends during the performance period.  The majority of awards have specific performance targets for achievement.  If the performance targets are not met,  the awards will be cancelled.

The total fair value of performance-based restricted shares vested and released during the year ended December 31,  2006,  was approximately $21 million.  The grant-date fair value is the quoted market value of the Company stock on the respective grant date.  The nonvested shares on December 31,  2008 and 2007 include promises to grant performance-based restricted stock of 26909 and 15700,  respectively.  These awards are similar to performance-based restricted stock,  including the payment of dividend equivalents,  but were granted in this manner because the employees were based outside of the United States.  
Performance Share Unit Awards In 2003,  the Company established a program to grant performance share units under the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan to executives.  In 2008,  the Company expanded the program to award a mix of stock options and performance share units to eligible employees in addition to executives.  The number of shares earned is determined at the end of each performance period,  generally three years,  based on the actual performance criteria predetermined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant.  If the performance criteria are met,  the award results in a grant of restricted stock or promises to grant restricted stock,  which are then generally subject to a holding period in order for the restricted stock to be released.  For performance share units granted before 2008,  this holding period is generally two years.  For performance share units granted in 2008,  this holding period is generally one year.  Restrictions on such stock generally lapse at the end of the holding period.  Performance share units generally do not pay dividends or allow voting rights during the performance period.  Accordingly,  the fair value of these units is the quoted market value of the Company stock on the date of the grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period.  Performance share units require achievement of certain financial measures,  primarily compound annual growth in earnings per share or economic profit.  These financial measures are adjusted for certain items approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year to year comparison of the specific performance criteria.  Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business.  In the event that the financial result equals the predefined target,  the Company will grant the number of restricted shares equal to the Target Award in the underlying performance share units agreement.  In the event the financial result exceeds the predefined target,  additional shares up to the Maximum Award may be granted.  In the event the financial result falls below the predefined target,  a reduced number of shares may be granted.  If the financial result falls below the Threshold Award performance level,  no shares will be granted.  Performance share units are generally settled in

NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Our Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S.  employees.  We also sponsor nonqualified,  unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates.  In addition,  our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.  Effective December 31,  2006,  the Company adopted SFAS No.  158,  which required the recognition in pension obligations and AOCI of actuarial gains or losses,  prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that had previously been deferred under the reporting requirements of SFAS No.  87,  SFAS No.  106 and SFAS No.  132(R).  As a result of the adoption,  the Company recorded approximately $288 million as an adjustment to AOCI as of December 31,  2006.  The applicable December 31,  2008 and 2007 balances included in our consolidated financial statements and footnotes reflect the adoption of SFAS No.  158.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) In February and October of 2007,  the Company amended its U.S.  retiree medical plan to limit the Company is exposure to increases in retiree medical costs associated with current and future retirees.  Based on the materiality of the change in liability resulting from the amendments,  we remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S.  retiree medical plan effective February 28,  2007 and October 31,  2007.  As a result of the remeasurements,  the Company reduced its liabilities for the U.S.  retiree medical plan by approximately $435 million.  In accordance with SFAS No.  158,  the Company also recognized the appropriate effects of the change in AOCI and deferred taxes.  The primary U.S.  defined benefit pension plan was amended effective December 31,  2008.  The plan will now have a two-part formula to determine pension benefits.  The first part will retain the current final-average pay structure,  where service will freeze as of January 1,  2010,  with pay escalating for the lesser of 10 years or until termination.  The second part of the formula will be a cash balance account which will commence January 12010 under which employees will receive credits based on age,  service,  pay and interest.  The plan was also modified to allow lump sum distributions.  These changes,  as well as related changes to other U.S.  plans,  reduced pension obligations by approximately $21 million.  In addition,  the U.S.  retiree medical plan was amended to close the plan to new hires effective January 1,  2009.  Certain amounts in the prior years' disclosure have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

For pension benefit plans,  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.  For other benefit plans,  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  Benefits paid to pension plan participants during 2008 and 2007 included approximately $44 million and $41 million,  respectively,  in payments related to unfunded pension plans that were paid from Company assets.  Benefits paid to participants of other benefit plans during 2008 and 2007 included approximately $2 million and $13 million,  respectively,  that were paid from Company assets.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was approximately $3209 million and approximately $3080 million as of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  respectively.  For pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,  the total projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were approximately $3416 million and $2051 million,  respectively,  as of December 31,  2008,  and $1372 million and $691 million,  respectively,  as of December 31,  2007.  For pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,  the total accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were approximately $2881 million and $1885 million,  respectively,  as of December 312008,  and approximately $996 million and $441 million,  respectively,  as of December 31,  2007.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) During 2007,  the Company amended its U.S.  retiree medical plan to limit the Company is exposure to increases in retiree medical costs for both current and future retirees.  As a result,  the effects of a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would not be significant to the Company.  The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.  Rates for each of our U.S.  plans at December 31,  2008 were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curvedeveloped from high-quality debt securities,  were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate.  For our non-U.S.  plans,  we base the discount rate on comparable indices within each of those countries.  The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.  We review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.  Plan Assets Pension Benefit Plans The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation and weighted-average target asset allocation for our U.S.  and non-U.S.  pension plan assets: 
Equity securities Debt securities Real estate and other2 Total 1 
Target Asset Allocation 
As of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  3 percent of total pension plan assets were invested in common stock of our Company.  As of December 31,  2008 and 2007,  9 percent and 7 percent,  respectively,  of total pension plan assets were invested in real estate.  
Investment objectives for the Company is U.S.  pension plan assets,  which comprise 66 percent of total pension plan assets as of December 31,  2008,  are to: (1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk; (2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; (3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class; and (4) focus on a long-term return objective.  Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S.  plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class,  as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate,  including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities,  diversification requirements and credit quality standards,  where applicable.  Unless exceptions have been approved,  investment managers are prohibited from buying or selling commodities,  futures or option contracts,  as well as from short selling of securities.  Furthermore,  investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines.  As of December 31,  2008,  no investment manager was responsible for more than 10 percent of total U.S.  plan assets.  In addition,  diversification requirements for each investment manager prevent a single security or other investment from exceeding 10 percent,  at historical cost,  of the individual manager is portfolio.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S.  plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class,  as well as correlations among asset classes.  We evaluate the rate of return assumption on an annual basis.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2008 net periodic pension cost for the U.S.  plans was 85 percent.  As of December 31,  2008,  the 10-year annualized return on U.S.  plan assets was 30 percent,  the 15-year annualized return was 75 percent,  and the annualized return since inception was 107 percent.  Plan assets for our pension plans outside the United States are insignificant on an individual plan basis.  Other Benefit Plans Plan assets associated with other benefits represent funding of the primary U.S.  postretirement benefit plan.  In late 2006,  we established and contributed $216 million to a U.S.  Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (''VEBA'),  a tax-qualified trust.  While the VEBA assets will remain segregated from the primary U.S.  pension master trust,  the current investments were determined in a methodology similar to that applied to the U.S.  pension plans described above.

Other Benefits 
The expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefit plans are net of estimated federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Federal subsidies are estimated to be approximately $2 million in 2009 to 2013 and estimated to be approximately $18 million for the period 2014-2018.  
Defined Contribution Plans Our Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S.  employees.  Under the primary plan,  we match 100 percent of participants' contributions up to a maximum of 3 percent of compensation.  Company costs related to the U.S.  plans were approximately $22 million,  $29 million and $25 million in 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States.  Company costs associated with those plans were approximately $20 million$25 million and $16 million in 2008,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17: INCOME TAXES (Continued) Our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits from having significant operations outside the United States that are taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S.  rate of 35 percent.  During 2008,  2007 and 2006,  the Company had several subsidiaries that benefited from various tax incentive grants.  The terms of these grants range from 2010 to 2031.  The Company expects each of the grants to be renewed indefinitely.  The grants did not have a material effect on the results of operations for the years ended December 31,  2008,  2007 or 2006.  The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S.  federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions.  U.S.  tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2005.  With respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside the United States,  with limited exceptions,  the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2001.  Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain,  the Company believes that adequate amounts of taxincluding interest and penalties,  have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from those years.  The Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No.  48,  effective January 1,  2007.  As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No.  48,  the Company recorded an approximate $65 million increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,  which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1,  2007,  balance of reinvested earnings.  As of December 31,  2008,  the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $369 million.  If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,  the net effect would be a benefit to the Company is effective tax rate of approximately $174 million,  exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties.  The remaining approximately $195 million,  which was recorded as a deferred tax assetprimarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.  In early July 2008,  agreements were reached between the U.S.  government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions.  Pursuant to these agreements,  we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest.  These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008,  and tax refunds and interest on refunds to be received in 2009.  These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods.  As a result of these agreements,  these deferred tax assets have been reclassified to income tax and interest receivables.  The settlements did not have a material impact on the Company is consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,  2008.  The impact of these agreements,  and other 2008 activity,  is reflected in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax assets as of December 31,  2008which is further described below.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17: INCOME TAXES (Continued) A reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits amounts is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31 2008

Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits 
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  As of December 31,  2008,  the Company had approximately $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued,  of which approximately $14 million of benefit was recognized through tax expense in 2008.  If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,  the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company is effective tax rate.  As of December 31,  2007,  the Company had approximately $272 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued,  of which approximately $82 million was recognized through tax expense in 2007.  It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months; howeverwe do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet.  These changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits,  statute of limitations expiring,  or final settlements in transfer pricing matters that are the subject of litigation.  At this timean estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.  
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17: INCOME TAXES (Continued) Undistributed earnings of the Company is foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $141 billion as of December 31,  2008.  Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,  accordingly,  no U.S.  federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon.
