PepsiCo,  Inc.  2011 Annual Report 
Dear Fellow Shareholders developing markets.  We continued to build our portfolio of billion-dollar brands.  We boosted our investment in research and development to build long-term,  differentiated platforms and significantly expand our healthier offerings within our snacks and beverages portfolios.  We focused on making our business more efficient,  and we began to align our global operating structure to fully leverage the scale of PepsiCo.  I am pleased to report that we have made strong progress.

The greatest challenge in business today is to renew a successful company — positioning it for long-term growth and profitability while performing in the current marketplace.  This is a challenge we embrace.  In late 2006,  we recognized that our consumers and the competitive environment were changing,  and that PepsiCo faced a dual challenge to perform in the short term while making some bold,  transformative moves to realize future growth opportunities and create long-term shareholder value.  
Starting in 2007,  we began our journey of renewal.  We stepped up our investments in emerging and

In 2011,  we successfully changed distribution for Gatorade products in the U.S.  in the convenience and other channels from a warehouse-delivered go-to-market system to DSD,  in order to more efficiently serve our customers.  
2012 and Beyond We made important strides in 2011.  In 2012,  our journey of renewal continues as we focus on five strategic imperatives.  
 We have an intense productivity focus.  At PepsiCo,  we believe that every penny is a prisoner.  In 2011,  we laid the groundwork for a new operating model to simplify our processes,  make decisions faster,  reduce costs,  minimize duplication of effort,  increase our speed to market and better match our innovations with market needs.  And in early 2012,  we announced a plan aimed to double our productivity over the next three years.  
1.  Build and extend our macrosnacks portfolio globally.  PepsiCo is the undisputed leader in macrosnacks around the world.  We will work to build our much-loved global snack brands — Lay is,  Doritos,  Cheetos and SunChips — while expanding our successful grain-based snacks platform globally.

In addition,  we have begun to implement a multiyear productivity program that we believe will further strengthen our complementary foods and beverages businesses.

Our first imperative is to build and extend our macrosnacks portfolio globally.  
PepsiCo is the undisputed leader in macrosnacks around the world.  We will work to grow our core salty snack brands — Lay is,  DoritosCheetos and SunChips — while continuing to expand into adjacent categories like whole grain-based snacks.  We will continue to create new flavors in tune with local tastes and leverage our go-to-market expertise to ensure our products are easily accessible in consumers' lives.  Our second imperative is to sustainably and profitably grow our beverage business worldwide.  
Our Business 
Our beverage business remains large and highly profitable,  accounting for approximately 52 percent of our net revenues in 2011.  Our goal is to grow our developed market beverage business while building on promising gains in emerging and developing markets.  We intend to continue to invest in and strengthen our most powerful and iconic beverage brands — Pepsi,  Mountain Dew,  Sierra Mist7UP (outside of the U.S. ),  Gatorade,  Tropicana,  Mirinda and Lipton (through our joint venture with Unilever).  
Executive Overview We are a leading global food and beverage company with hundreds of brands that are respected household names throughout the world.  Either independently or through contract manufacturers or authorized bottlers,  we make,  market,  sell and distribute a variety of convenient and enjoyable foods and beverages in more than 200 countries and territories.  We continue to be guided by Performance with Purpose — our belief that what is good for business can and should be good for society.  Our commitment to deliver sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet is as much of a financial decision as it is an ethical one.  In 2011,  PepsiCo earned a place on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fifth consecutive year,  the North America Index for the sixth consecutive year and was ranked as the number one company in the index is Food and Beverage Supersector.  Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition.  These indicators include market share,  volume,  net revenue,  operating profit,  management operating cash flow,  earnings per share and return on invested capital.  
Our third imperative is to build and expand our nutrition business.  
Today,  PepsiCo has three of the top brands in the category — Quaker,  Tropicana and Gatorade — in a global market for health and wellness in consumer packaged goods that exceeds $500 billiondriven by strong demographic and consumer trends.  Building from our core brands,  we believe that we are well-positioned to grow our global nutrition portfolio.  Our fourth imperative is to increase and capitalize on the already high coincidence of snack and beverage consumption.  
Snacks and beverages are complementary categories.  When people reach for a salty snack,  about 30 percent of the time,  they reach for a carbonated beverage.  Our ability to use that combined power goes beyond marketing — to innovation,  production,  distribution and brand management.  We intend to increasingly capitalize on our cross-category presence to grow our positions in both snacks and beverages.  
Strategies to Drive Our Growth into the Future 
We made important strides in 2011.  In 2012,  our journey continues.  We are pursuing specific strategic investment and productivity initiatives to build a stronger,  more successful company.  This includes an increased investment in our iconic,  global brands,  bringing innovation to market and increasing our advertising and marketing spending by approximately $500–$600 million in 2012,  the majority in North America.  In addition,  we have begun to implement a multiyear productivity program that we believe will further strengthen our complementary food and beverage businesses.  These initiatives support our five strategic imperatives on which we continue to be focused.  
Our fifth imperative is to ensure prudent and responsible financial management.  
Prudent financial management has always been a hallmark of PepsiCo.  In 2012,  we are bringing renewed focus to value creation in everything we do.  We intend to continue to deliver attractive cash returns for shareholders by scrutinizing every capital expenditureexpense and working capital investment.  
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2011 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
Our Operations We are organized into four business units,  as follows: 1) PepsiCo Americas Foods (PAF),  which includes Frito-Lay North America (FLNA),  Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) and all of our Latin American food and snack businesses (LAF); 2) PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB),  which includes all of our North American and Latin American beverage businesses; 3) PepsiCo Europe,  which includes all beverage,  food and snack businesses in Europe; and 4) PepsiCo Asia,  Middle East and Africa (AMEA),  which includes all beverage,  food and snack businesses in AMEA.  
Latin America Foods Either independently or through contract manufacturers,  LAF makes,  markets,  sells and distributes a number of snack food brands including Marias Gamesa,  Doritos,  Cheetos,  Ruffles,  SaladitasEmperador,  Tostitos and Sabritas,  as well as many Quaker-brand cereals and snacks.  These branded products are sold to independent distributors and retailers.  PepsiCo Americas Beverages Either independently or through contract manufacturers,  PAB makes,  markets,  sells and distributes beverage concentrates,  fountain syrups and finished goods,  under various beverage brands including Pepsi,  Gatorade,  Mountain Dew,  Diet Pepsi,  Aquafina,  7UP (outside the U.S. ),  Diet Mountain Dew,  Tropicana Pure PremiumSierra Mist and Mirinda.  PAB also,  either independently or through contract manufacturers,  makes,  markets and sells ready-to-drink tea,  coffee and water products through joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks.  In addition,  PAB licenses the Aquafina water brand to its independent bottlers.  Furthermore,  PAB manufactures and distributes certain brands licensed from Dr Pepper Snapple Group,  Inc.  (DPSG),  including Dr Pepper and Crush.  PAB operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities.  PAB also sells concentrate and finished goods for our brands to authorized bottlers,  and some of these branded finished goods are sold directly by us to independent distributors and retailers.  We and the independent bottlers sell our brands as finished goods to independent distributors and retailers.  PAB is volume reflects sales to its independent distributors and retailers,  as well as the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that bottlers have reported as sold to independent distributors and retailers.  Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality,  timing of product launches,  product mix,  bottler inventory practices and other factors.  However,  the difference between BCS and CSE measures has been greatly reduced since our acquisitions of our anchor bottlers,  The Pepsi Bottling GroupInc.  (PBG) and PepsiAmericas,  Inc.  (PAS),  on February 26,  2010,  as we now consolidate these bottlers and thus eliminate the impact of differences between BCS and CSE for a substantial majority of PAB is total volume.  While our revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume,  as there continue to be independent bottlers in the supply chain,  we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our products at the consumer level.  See Note 15 for additional information about our acquisitions of PBG and PAS in 2010.  
Our four business units are comprised of six reportable segments (referred to as divisions),  as follows: t '-/'' t 2'/'' t ''' t 1'' t &VSPQF BOE t ''. &'' Frito-Lay North America Either independently or through contract manufacturers,  FLNA makes,  markets,  sells and distributes branded snack foods.

In additionEurope licenses the Aquafina water brand to certain of its authorized bottlers and markets this brand.  Europe also,  either independently or through contract manufacturers,  makes,  markets and sells readyto-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name).  Europe reports two measures of volume.  Snacks volume is reported on a system-wide basis,  which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks.  Beverage volume reflects Company-owned or authorized bottler sales of beverages bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks to independent distributors and retailers (see PepsiCo Americas Beverages above).  In 2011,  we acquired Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD),  Russia is leading branded food and beverage company.  WBD is portfolio of products is included within Europe is snacks or beverage reportingdepending on product type.  See Note 15 for additional information about our acquisition of WBD in 2011.  
Our Customers Our primary customers include wholesale distributors,  grocery stores,  convenience stores,  mass merchandisers,  membership storesauthorized independent bottlers and foodservice distributorsincluding hotels and restaurants.  We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area.  These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate,  finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality.  Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  For our independent distributors and retailers,  these incentives include volume-based rebates,  product placement fees,  promotions and displays.  For our independent bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentives,  advertising support,  new product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include coupons,  pricing discounts and promotions,  and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media.  New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-of-purchase materials,  product placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  In 2011,  sales to Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 11% of our total net revenue.  Our top five retail customers represented approximately 30% of our 2011 North American net revenue,  with Wal-Mart (including Sam is) representing approximately 18%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.

Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD),  customer warehouse and foodservice and vending distribution networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needs,  product characteristics and local trade practices.  Direct-Store-Delivery We,  our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.  DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.

Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,  have lower turnover,  and are less likely to be impulse purchases.  
Our Business Risks Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute 'forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the 'Reform Act").  Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as 'believe, " 'expect, " 'intend, " 'estimate, " 'project, " 'anticipate, " 'will" and variations of such words and other similar expressions.  All statements addressing our future operating performance,  and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future,  are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act.  These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information,  operating plans and projections about future events and trends.  They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statements.  Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements,  which speak only as of the date they are made.  We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement,  whether as a result of new information,  future events or otherwise.  The discussion of risks below and elsewhere in this report is by no means all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance.  
Foodservice and Vending Our foodservice and vending sales force distributes snacks,  foods and beverages to third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  Our foodservice and vending sales force also distributes certain beverages through our independent bottlers.  This distribution system supplies our products to restaurantsbusinesses,  schools,  stadiums and similar locations.  Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  Our beverage,  snack and food brands compete against global,  regional,  local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  In U.S.  measured channels,  our chief beverage competitor,  The Coca-Cola Company,  has a larger share of carbonated soft drinks (CSD) consumption,  while we have a larger share of liquid refreshment beverages consumption.  In addition,  The Coca- Cola Company has a significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside the United States.  Our snack and food brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack and food industry worldwide.  Our beverage,  snack and food brands compete on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products,  the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns,  marketing programs,  product packaging,  pricing,  increased efficiency in production techniques and brand and trademark development and protection.  We believe that the strength of our brands,  innovation and marketing,  coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network,  allows us to compete effectively.  
Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.  
We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive categories and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits,  we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position.  Our success depends on: our ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer trends,  including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly concerned with health and wellness; our product quality; our ability to extend our portfolio of convenient foods in growing markets; our ability to develop new products that are responsive to consumer preferences,  including our 'fun-for-you",  'good-for-you" and 'better-for-you" products; and our ability to respond to competitive product and pricing pressures.  For example,  our growth rate may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or grow our current share of the liquid refreshment beverage market in North America,  or our current share of the snack market globally,  or if demand for our products does not grow in emerging and developing markets.  In general,  changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors,  including the aging of the general population; consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers.  Those Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations.  Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers.  In addition,  certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for their Board services.

sugar or other product ingredients or attributes; changes in social trends that impact travel,  vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory action or litigation against us or other companies in our industry; a downturn in economic conditions; or taxes that would increase the cost of our products to consumers.  Any of these changes may reduce consumers' willingness to purchase our products.  See also 'Our financial performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. "'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. ",  'Any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our businessfinancial condition and results of operations. " and 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activitiesincrease our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " Our continued success is also dependent on our product innovation,  including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products and improving the quality of existing products,  and the effectiveness of our product packaging,  advertising campaigns and marketing programs,  including our ability to successfully adapt to a rapidly changing media environment,  such as through use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  Although we devote significant resources to the actions mentioned above,  there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands,  as well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  
Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  
Many of the countries in which we operate,  including the United States and several of the members of the European Union,  have experienced and continue to experience unfavorable economic conditions.  Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these unfavorable economic conditions,  including: adverse changes in interest rates,  tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets and inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace,  potentially impairing our ability to access the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions; reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down in the general global economy or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional,  local or private label products or other economy products,  or to less profitable channels; impairment of assets; or a decrease in the fair value of pension assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension plans.  In addition,  we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our critical customers,  suppliers and distributors and any negative impact on our critical customers,  suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  In addition,  some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions,  including U.S.  and non-U.S.  commercial banks,  insurance companies,  investment banks,  and other financial institutions,  may be exposed to a ratings downgrade,  bankruptcyliquidity,  default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.  A ratings downgrade,  bankruptcy,  receivership,  default or similar event involving a major financial institution may limit the availability of credit or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all orwith respect to financial institutions who are parties to our financing arrangements,  leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials which could have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  
Our financial performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.  
The food,  snack and beverage industries in which we operate are highly competitive.  We compete with major international foodsnack and beverage companies that,  like us,  operate in multiple geographic areas,  as well as regional,  local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  In many countries where we do business,  including the United States,  The Coca- Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor.  We also compete with other large companies in each of the food,  snack and beverage categoriesincluding Nestlé S. A.,  Kraft Foods Inc.  and Dr Pepper Snapple GroupInc.  We compete on the basis of brand recognition,  taste,  price,  quality,  product variety,  distribution,  marketing and promotional activityconvenience,  service and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.  If we are unable to compete effectively,  we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets.  This may have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins.  See also 'Unfavorable 
Any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering,  the failure to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers,  or allegations of product quality issuesmislabeling or contamination,  even if untrue,  may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption,  causes injury or is mislabeled,  we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability issue could cause our products to be unavailable 28

increased costs of business due to compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,  including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act,  and adverse consequences,  such as the assessment of fines or penalties,  for failing to comply with these laws and regulations.  In addition,  disruption in these markets due to political instability or civil unrest could result in a decline in consumer purchasing power,  thereby reducing demand for our products.  See also 'Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively. ",  'Our financial performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.

" and 'Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations. " 
for a period of time,  which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following,  or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities; the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodium,  saturated fat and added sugar reduction or the development of our global nutrition business; our research and development efforts; our environmental impact,  including use of agricultural materials,  packaging,  energy use and waste management; or our responses to any of the foregoing.  In addition,  water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to increase.  Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act,  or are perceived not to act,  responsibly with respect to water use.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our businessfinancial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  
Trade consolidation or the loss of any key customer could adversely affect our financial performance.  
We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  as well as other retailers,  to effectively compete.  The loss of any of our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.  In addition,  in the event that retail ownership becomes more concentrated,  retailers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and private label brandsthe competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to any such actions or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  
Our financial performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets or as a result of unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are sold.  
Our operations outside of the United States,  particularly in RussiaMexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom,  contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability,  and we believe that our businesses in developing and emerging markets,  particularly China and Indiapresent important future growth opportunities for us.  Howeverthere can be no assurance that our existing products,  variants of our existing products or new products that we make,  manufacture,  market or sell will be accepted or successful in any particular developing or emerging market,  due to local competition,  product price,  cultural differences or otherwise.  If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets,  or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investmentsparticularly in Russia,  as a result of economic and political conditions,  increased competition,  reduced demand for our products,  an inability to acquire or form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments or for any other reason,  our financial performance could be adversely affected.  Unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are sold,  including in Russia,  the Middle East and Egypt,  could also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Factors that could adversely affect our business results in these markets include: foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries,  which,  from time to time,  result in significant cash balances in foreign countries such as Venezuelaand on the repatriation of funds; currency hyperinflation or devaluation; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; and 
Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  
The conduct of our businesses,  including the production,  distribution,  sale,  advertising,  marketing,  labeling,  safety,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made,  manufactured or sold,  including in emerging and developing markets where legal and regulatory systems may be less developed.  These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change,  sometimes dramatically,  as a result of political,  economic or social events.  Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling,  advertising and marketing practices; laws regarding the import of ingredients used in our products; laws regarding the export of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing ingredients present in certain of our products,  such as sodium29

normal course of business,  as well as environmental remediationproduct liability,  toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations of businesses acquired by our subsidiaries.  Due to regulatory complexities,  uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries,  the potential exists for remediationliability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

saturated fat and added sugar; increased regulatory scrutiny of,  and increased litigation involving,  product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients in,  or attributes of,  certain of our products; state consumer protection laws; taxation requirements,  including taxes that would increase the cost of our products to consumers; competition laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating access to and use of water or utilities; and environmental laws,  including laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment.  New lawsregulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations,  or changes in any of the foregoing,  may alter the environment in which we do business and,  therefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  Governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where we operate may also impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  Studies are underway by third parties to assess the health implications of consumption of carbonated soft drinks as well as certain ingredients present in some of our products.  In addition,  third-party studies are also underway to assess the effect on humans due to acrylamide in the diet.  Acrylamide is a chemical compound naturally formed in a wide variety of foods when they are cooked (whether commercially or at home),  including french fries,  potato chips,  cereal,  bread and coffee.  Certain of these studies have found that it is probable that acrylamide causes cancer in laboratory animals when consumed in extraordinary amounts.  If consumer concerns about the health implications of consumption of carbonated soft drinks,  certain ingredients present in some of our products or acrylamide increase as a result of these studiesother new scientific evidence,  or for any other reason,  whether or not valid,  demand for our products could decline and we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products,  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are also subject to Proposition 65 in California,  a law which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance listed by that State as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold,  sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may also have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctions,  which could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance,  our employees or suppliers could take actions that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations.  Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition,  we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the 
If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  successfully implement our ongoing business transformation initiative or outsource certain functions effectivelyour business could suffer.  
We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations,  to interface with our customers,  to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency,  to comply with regulatory financial reporting,  legal and tax requirements,  and for digital marketing activities and electronic communication among our locations around the world and between our personnel and the personnel of our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers and suppliers.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of customers,  business disruptions,  the loss of or damage to intellectual property,  or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise.  We have embarked on multi-year business transformation initiatives to migrate certain of our financial processing systems to enterprise-wide systems solutions.  There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the applications on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue.  In addition,  we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions,  such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration,  to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform or do not perform effectively,  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers.  Depending on the function involvedsuch errors may also lead to business disruption,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of or damage to intellectual property through 30

security breach,  the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise,  litigation,  or remediation costs and could have a negative impact on employee morale.  Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential information,  corrupting information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets,  litigation,  remediation costs,  damage to our reputation and loss of revenue resulting from unauthorized use of confidential information or failure to retain or attract customers following such an event.  
Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
Our ability,  and that of our suppliers,  business partners,  including our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  independent distributors and retailers,  to make,  manufacture,  distribute and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to any of the following could impair our ability to make,  manufacture,  distribute or sell our products: adverse weather conditions or natural disastersuch as a hurricane,  earthquake or flooding; government action; fire; terrorism; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; pandemic; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occurcould adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  
Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  
We hold assets and incur liabilities,  earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.  dollars,  the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S.  dollars.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate a significant portion of our net revenue.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition.  See also 'Market Risks" and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costsdisruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  
We and our business partners use various raw materials and other supplies in our business.  The principal ingredients we use include apple,  orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentratesaspartame,  corn,  corn sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruit and other fruits,  oats,  oranges,  potatoes,  raw milk,  rice,  seasoningssucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils,  and wheat.  Our key packaging materials include plastic resins,  including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resin used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles,  closures,  cardboard and paperboard cartons.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities due to their use in our plants and facilities and in the trucks delivering our products.  Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced internationally and some are available from a limited number of suppliers.  We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy.  The raw materials and energy which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand,  weather conditions,  agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costswe may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating results.  In addition,  we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain raw materials.  Certain of these derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can 
Climate change,  or legal,  regulatory or market measures to address climate change,  may negatively affect our business and operations.  
There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures,  weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivitywe may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our productssuch as sugar cane,  corn,  wheat,  rice,  oats,  potatoes and various fruits.  We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change,  which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.  In additionnatural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.  The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional,  federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases.  In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency,  we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery.  In particular,  increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result,  climate change could negatively 31

With respect to joint ventures,  we share ownership and management responsibility of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals,  strategies,  priorities or resources as we do and joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-ownersrather than for our exclusive benefit.  In addition,  acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States,  including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with laws and regulations outside the United States.  With respect to divestitureswe may not be able to complete proposed divestitures on terms commercially favorable to us.  If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations,  or if a divestiture is not successfully completed,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

See also 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activitiesincrease our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " and 'Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations. " If we are unable to hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce,  it could have a negative impact on our business.  
Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  We compete to hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions,  including our Chief Executive Officer,  or to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  In additionour operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees,  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  A portion of our workforce belongs to unions.  Failure to successfully renew collective bargaining agreements,  or strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer.  
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire on various dates.  Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms,  which could adversely impact our operating results.  The terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.  
Failure to successfully implement our global operating model could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations,  or to complete divestiturescould have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
We recently created the Global Beverages Group and the Global Snacks Group,  both of which are focused on innovation,  research and development,  brand management and best-practice sharing around the world,  as well as collaborating with our Global Nutrition Group to grow our nutrition portfolio.  If we are unable to successfully implement our global operating model,  including retention of key employees,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  
We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions,  joint ventures and divestitures.  Potential issues associated with these activities could include,  among other things,  our ability to realize the full extent of the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of an acquisition or the formation of a joint venture within the anticipated time frame,  or at all; receipt of necessary consents,  clearances and approvals in connection with an acquisition or joint venture; and diversion of management is attention from base strategies and objectives.  In 2011,  we acquired WimmBill-Dann Foods OJSC (WBD),  a Russian company.  We continue to assess WBD is business practices,  policies and procedures as well as its compliance with our Worldwide Code of Conduct and applicable laws and,  as described under Management is Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,  we are in the process of integrating WBD into our overall internal control over financial reporting processes.  With respect to acquisitions,  including but not limited to the acquisition of WBD,  the following also pose potential risks: our 
Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity plan could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
We are implementing a strategic plan that we believe will position our business for future success and growth,  to allow us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food,  snack and beverage industries.  In order to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts,  it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business,  which may be limited due to capital constraints.  In addition,  it is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plan.  Our 32

In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  See Note 9 for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.  Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly,  including a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.  See 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note 10 for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension plan assets and pension and retiree medical liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  
future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to reduce costs and improve efficiencies.  If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity plan or fail to implement it as timely as we anticipate,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.  
Our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets.  Any downgrade of our current credit ratings by a credit rating agency,  especially any downgrade to below investment grade,  could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all.  In addition,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historicallyand therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade.  Our intellectual property rights could be infringed or challenged and reduce the value of our products and brands and have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business.  These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrights,  patents,  business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products,  their packaging,  the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses.  We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark,  copyright,  patent and trade secret laws,  third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property.  If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrights,  patents,  business processes and other trade secrets,  or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual propertythe value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  See also 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " 
Commodity Prices 
We expect to be able to reduce the impact of volatility in our raw material and energy costs through our hedging strategies and ongoing sourcing initiatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchasesprimarily for metals,  energy and agricultural products.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $598 million as of December 31,  2011 and $590 million as of December 25,  2010.  At the end of 2011,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instrumentsassuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2011 by $52 million.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $630 million as of December 31,  2011 and $266 million as of December 25,  2010.  At the end of 2011,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net losses in 2011 by $58 million.

Foreign Exchange 
Interest Rates 
Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate approximately 50% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 23% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  During 2011favorable foreign currency contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth,  primarily due to appreciation of the euro,  Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.  Currency declines against the U.S.  dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  In addition,  we continue to use the official exchange rate to translate the financial statements of our snack and beverage businesses in Venezuela.  We use the official rate as we currently intend to remit dividends solely through the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI).  As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  the results of our Venezuelan businesses were reported under hyperinflationary accounting.  Consequently,  the functional currency of our Venezuelan entities was changed from the bolivar fuerte (bolivar) to the U.S.  dollar.  Effective January 11,  2010,  the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from 215 bolivars per dollar to 43 bolivars per dollar; howevercertain activities were permitted to access an exchange rate of 26 bolivars per dollar.  We continue to use all available options to obtain U.S.  dollars to meet our operational needs.  In 2011 and 2010the majority of our transactions were remeasured at the 43 exchange rate,  and as a result of the change to hyperinflationary accounting and the devaluation of the bolivar,  we recorded a one-time net charge of $120 million in the first quarter of 2010.  In 2011 and 2010our operations in Venezuela comprised 8% and 4% of our cash and cash equivalents balance,  respectively,  and generated less than 1% of our net revenue.  As of January 1,  2011,  the Venezuelan government unified the country is two official exchange rates (43 and 26 bolivars per dollar) by eliminating the 26 bolivars per dollar rate,  which was previously permitted for certain activities.  This change did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  We may enter into derivativesprimarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $23 billion as of December 31,  2011 and $17 billion as of December 25,  2010.  At the end of 2011,  we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains by $105 million.  For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  all losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swapscross-currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness has been swapped to floating rates.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  Assuming year-end 2011 variable rate debt and investment levelsa 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $55 million in 2011.  Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives necessarily involves taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As suchwe leverage an integrated risk management framework to identifyassess,  prioritize,  address,  manage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes: t 1FQTJ$PTPBSEPG%JSFDUPST XIJDIJTSFTQPOTJCMFGPSPWFSTFFJOH the Company is risk assessment and mitigation,  receives updates on key risks throughout the year.

year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  Certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rights and sponsorship contracts,  may extend beyond one year.  Payments made to obtain these rights are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $288 million as of December 312011 and $296 million as of December 25,  2010 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For interim reporting,  our policy is to allocate our forecasted fullyear sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs.  The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period is actual gross revenue to our forecasted annual gross revenue.  Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period,  any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized in the interim period as they are identified.  In additionwe apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for other marketplace spending,  which includes the costs of advertising and other marketing activities.  See Note 2 for additional information on our sales incentives and other marketplace spending.  Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,  the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results.  These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: t SFWFOVFSFDPHOJUJPO t HPPEXJMMBOEPUIFSJOUBOHJCMFBTTFUT t JODPNFUBYFYQFOTFBOEBDDSVBMTBOE t QFOTJPOBOESFUJSFFNFEJDBMQMBOT Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit termswhich are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally,  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarlyour policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In additionDSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  we monitor customer inventory levels.  As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $346 billion in 2011,  $291 billion in 2010 and $129 billion in 2009.  Sales incentives include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targets,  and accruals are established during the 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands in acquisitions.  In a business combination,  the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities,  including brands,  based on estimated fair values,  with any excess recorded as goodwill.  Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  such as marketplace participants,  product life cycles,  market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance,  and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful lives,  which generally range from five to 40 years.  Determining the expected 35 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2011 Annual Report 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair valueas determined by its discounted cash flows.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record,  if any.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair valuewhich is based on its discounted future cash flows.  In connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided PBG and PAS with the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.  In determining the useful life of these reacquired franchise rights,  we considered many factorsincluding the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements,  the indefinite period expected for the reacquired rights to contribute to our future cash flows,  as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of the reacquired rights to us,  including legalregulatory,  contractual,  competitive,  economic or other factors.  Therefore,  certain reacquired franchise rights,  as well as perpetual brands and goodwill,  are not amortized,  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually.  Certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.  On December 7,  2009,  we reached an agreement with DPSG to manufacture and distribute Dr Pepper and certain other DPSG products in the territories where they were previously sold by PBG and PAS.  Under the terms of the agreement,  we made an upfront payment of $900 million to DPSG on February 26,  2010.  Based upon the terms of the agreement with DPSG,  the amount of the upfront payment was capitalized and is not amortized,  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually.  Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluationssuch as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are based 
on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented.  In addition,  as of December 31,  2011,  we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.  In connection with the merger and integration of WBD in 2011,  we recorded a $14 million impairment charge for discontinued brands.  We did not recognize any impairment charges for other nonamortizable intangible assets in 2010 and 2009.  As of December 31,  2011,  we had $314 billion of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets,  of which approximately 70% related to the acquisitions of PBG,  PAS and WBD.  Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances,  such as the progress of a tax audit.  An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results,  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets ifbased on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  In 2011,  our annual tax rate was 268% compared to 230% in 2010,  as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2011 increased 38 percentage points primarily reflecting the prior year non-taxable gain and reversal of deferred taxes 36

Curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class,  taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.  Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%.  Our 2011 target investment allocation was 40% for U.S.  equity,  20% for international equity and 40% for fixed income.  For 2012,  our target allocations are as follows: 40% for fixed income,  33% for U.S.  equity22% for international equity and 5% for real estate.  The change to the 2012 target asset allocations was made to increase diversification.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value.  For all other asset categories,  we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets is added to,  or subtracted from,  other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.  The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan is liability and expense is reviewed annually.  Our review is based on our claim experience,  information provided by our health plans and actuaries,  and our knowledge of the health care industry.

Based on our assumptions,  we expect our pension and retiree medical expenses to increase in 2012 primarily driven by lower discount rates,  partially offset by expected asset returns on contributions and changes to other actuarial assumptions.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  The estimated impact of a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate on 2012 pension expense is an increase of approximately $62 million.  The estimated impact on 2012 pension expense of a 25-basis-point decrease in the expected rate of return is an increase of approximately $31 million.  See Note 7 for information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  Funding We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis,  although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.  Our pension contributions for 2011 were $239 million,  of which $61 million was discretionary.  Our retiree medical contributions for 2011 were $110 million,  none of which was discretionary.  In 2012,  we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $13 billion,  with up to approximately $1 billion expected to be discretionary.  Our cash payments for retiree medical benefits are estimated to be approximately $124 million in 2012.  Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors,  such as changes in interest rates,  deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7.  
53rd Week In 2011,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  The 53rd week increased 2011 net revenue by $623 million and operating profit by $109 million ($64 million after-tax or $004 per share).

Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include metals,  energy and agricultural products.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2011,  we recognized $102 million ($71 million after-tax or $004 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2010,  we recognized $91 million ($58 million after-tax or $004 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2009,  we recognized $274 million ($173 million after-tax or $011 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  
in 2011,  and we anticipate approximately $550 million of related cash expenditures during 2012,  with the balance of approximately $175 million of related cash expenditures in 2013 through 2015.  The Productivity Plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2012 with incremental productivity initiatives continuing through the end of 2015.  In 2009,  we incurred charges of $36 million ($29 million after-tax or $002 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity for Growth program that began in 2008.  The program included actions in all divisions of the business,  including the closure of six plants,  to increase cost competitiveness across the supply chain,  upgrade and streamline our product portfolio,  and simplify the organization for more effective and timely decision-making.  This program was completed in the second quarter of 2009.  Gain on Previously Held Equity Interests In 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PASwe recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 million ($060 per share),  comprising $735 million which was non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.  
Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2011,  we incurred restructuring charges of $383 million ($286 million after-tax or $018 per share) in conjunction with our multi-year productivity plan (Productivity Plan),  including $76 million recorded in the FLNA segment,  $18 million recorded in the QFNA segment$48 million recorded in the LAF segment,  $81 million recorded in the PAB segment,  $77 million recorded in the Europe segment$9 million recorded in the AMEA segment and $74 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.  The Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food,  snack and beverage businesses by leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo is operations,  go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing,  warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures,  with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.  The Productivity Plan is expected to enhance PepsiCo is cost-competitiveness,  provide a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives,  and serve as a financial cushion for potential macroeconomic uncertainty beyond 2012.  As a result,  we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $910 million,  $383 million of which was reflected in our 2011 results,  approximately $425 million of which will be reflected in our 2012 results and the balance of which will be reflected in our 2013,  2014 and 2015 results.  These charges will be comprised of approximately $500 million of severance and other employee-related costs; approximately $325 million for other costs,  including consulting-related costs and the termination of leases and other contracts; and approximately $85 million for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions.  These charges resulted in cash expenditures of $30 million 
Merger and Integration Charges In 2011,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $329 million ($271 million after-tax or $017 per share) related to our acquisitions of PBG,  PAS and WBD,  including $112 million recorded in the PAB segment,  $123 million recorded in the Europe segment,  $78 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense.  These charges also include closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD.  In 2010,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $799 million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  as well as advisory fees in connection with our acquisition of WBD.  $467 million of these charges were recorded in the PAB segment,  $111 million recorded in the Europe segment,  $191 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $30 million recorded in interest expense.  The merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS were incurred to help create a more fully integrated supply chain and go-to-market business model,  to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the distribution of our brands and to enhance our revenue growth.  These charges also include closing costs,  onetime financing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  In addition,  we recorded $9 million of merger-related charges,  representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS,  in bottling equity income.  In total,  the above charges had an after-tax impact of $648 million or $040 per share.  In 2009,  we incurred $50 million of merger-related charges,  as well as an additional $11 million of merger-related charges,  representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS,  recorded in bottling equity income.  In total,  these charges had an after-tax impact of $44 million or $003 per share.

Inventory Fair Value Adjustments In 2011,  we recorded $46 million ($28 million after-tax or $002 per share) of incremental costs in cost of sales related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in WBD is balance sheet at the acquisition date and hedging contracts included in PBG is and PAS is balance sheets at the acquisition date.  In 2010,  we recorded $398 million ($333 million after-tax or $021 per share) of incremental costs related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG is and PAS is balance sheets at the acquisition date.  Substantially all of these costs were recorded in cost of sales.  
Non-GAAP Measures Certain measures contained in this Annual Report are financial measures that are adjusted for items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability" for a detailed list and description of each of these items),  as well as,  in certain instances,  adjusted for foreign currency.  These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Items adjusted for currency assume foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period.  In order to compute our constant currency results,  we multiply or divide,  as appropriate,  our current year U.S.  dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,  as appropriate,  those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP reporting measures.  
Venezuela Currency Devaluation As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  we recorded a one-time $120 million net charge related to our change to hyperinflationary accounting for our Venezuelan businesses and the related devaluation of the bolivar.  $129 million of this net charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses,  with the balance (income of $9 million) recorded in our PAB segment.  In total,  this net charge had an after-tax impact of $120 million or $007 per share.  
Results of Operations—Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit beloweffective net pricing reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions,  sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.  Additionally,  acquisitions and divestitures reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity,  including the impact of acquisitionsdivestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.  
Asset Write-Off In 2010,  we recorded a $145 million charge ($92 million after-tax or $006 per share) related to a change in scope of one release in our ongoing migration to SAP software.  This change was driven,  in partby a review of our North America systems strategy following our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  This change does not impact our overall commitment to continue our implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years.  
Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i, e.,  kilos,  gallons,  pounds and case sales),  a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume.  Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  In 2011,  total servings increased 6% compared to 2010.  Excluding the impact of the 53rd week,  total servings increased 5% compared to 2010.  In 2010,  total servings increased 7% compared to 2009.  2011 servings growth reflects an adjustment to the base year (2010) for divestitures that occurred in 2011,  as applicable.  
Foundation Contribution In 2010,  we made a $100 million ($64 million after-tax or $004 per share) contribution to The PepsiCo Foundation,  Inc.,  in order to fund charitable and social programs over the next several years.  This contribution was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.  Debt Repurchase In 2010,  we paid $672 million in a cash tender offer to repurchase $500 million (aggregate principal amount) of our 790% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2018.  As a result of this debt repurchase,  we recorded a $178 million charge to interest expense ($114 million after-tax or $007 per share),  primarily representing the premium paid in the tender offer.

Prior to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS on February 26,  2010we had noncontrolling interests in each of these bottlers and consequently included our share of their net income in bottling equity income.  Upon consummation of the acquisitions in the first quarter of 2010,  we began to consolidate the results of these bottlers and recorded a $735 million gain in bottling equity income associated with revaluing our previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS to fair value.  
Bottling equity income increased $370 million,  primarily reflecting the gain on our previously held equity interests in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  partially offset by the consolidation of the related financial results of the acquired bottlers.  Net interest expense increased $505 million,  primarily reflecting higher average debt balances,  interest expense incurred in connection with our cash tender offer to repurchase debt,  and bridge and term financing costs in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  These increases were partially offset by lower average rates on our debt balances.  The reported tax rate decreased 30 percentage points compared to the prior year,  primarily reflecting the impact of our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  which includes the reversal of deferred taxes attributable to our previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS,  as well as the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in 2010.  Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 6% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 4%.  Items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") decreased net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 8 percentage points.  
Bottling equity income decreased $735 million,  reflecting the gain in the prior year on our previously held equity interests in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.

Net revenue grew 37%,  primarily reflecting the incremental finished goods revenue related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  Unfavorable foreign currency reduced net revenue growth by over 1 percentage point.  Operating profit grew 11%,  primarily reflecting incremental operating results from our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  Operating profit growth was also adversely impacted by the items affecting comparability in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability").  Excluding these items,  operating profit increased 27%.  Unfavorable foreign currency reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition,  together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing (including long-term debt financing which,  depending upon market conditions,  we may use to replace a portion of our commercial paper borrowings),  will be adequate to meet our operating,  investing and financing needs.  However,  there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all.  See Note 9 for a description of our credit facilities.  See also 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " in 'Our Business Risks. " In addition,  currency restrictions enacted by the government in Venezuela have impacted our ability to pay dividends outside of the country from our snack and beverage operations in Venezuela.  As of December 31,  2011,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 8% of our cash and cash equivalents balance.  Furthermore,  our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.  On a continuing basis,  we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results,  including acquisitions,  divestitures,  joint ventures and share repurchases.  These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.  
Snacks volume grew 16%,  reflecting broad-based increases driven by double-digit growth in India,  the Middle East and China,  partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Australia.  Acquisitions contributed nearly 3 percentage points to the snacks volume growth.

The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2011 
Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used for investing activities Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities 
During 2010,  net cash provided by financing activities was $14 billion,  primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $65 billion,  mostly in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $25 billion.  These increases were largely offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments of $80 billion.  We annually review our capital structure with our Board,  including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  In the first quarter of 2012,  our Board of Directors approved a 4% dividend increaseraising the dividend payable on our common stock,  effective with the dividend payable in June 2012,  to $215 per share.  We expect to repurchase approximately $30 billion of our common stock in 2012.  
Operating Activities During 2011,  net cash provided by operating activities was $89 billion,  compared to net cash provided of $84 billion in the prior year.  The increase over the prior year primarily reflects the overlap of discretionary pension contributions of $13 billion ($10 billion aftertax) in the prior year,  partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.  During 2010,  net cash provided by operating activities was $84 billion,  compared to net cash provided of $68 billion in the prior year.  The increase over the prior year primarily reflects the incremental operating results from our acquisitions of PBG and PASas well as favorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.  Also see 'Management Operating Cash Flow" below for certain other items impacting net cash provided by operating activities.  
Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value,  and it is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  it is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Therefore,  this measure is not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP cash flow measures.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  Additionally,  we consider certain items (included in the table below),  in evaluating management operating cash flow.  We believe investors should consider these items in evaluating our management operating cash flow results.  The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities,  as reflected in our cash flow statement,  to our management operating cash flow excluding the impact of the items below.  
Investing Activities During 2011,  net cash used for investing activities was $56 billionprimarily reflecting $33 billion for net capital spending and $24 billion of cash paid,  net of cash and cash equivalents acquiredin connection with our acquisition of WBD.  During 2010,  net cash used for investing activities was $77 billion,  primarily reflecting $32 billion for net capital spending$28 billion of net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  and $09 billion of cash paid in connection with our manufacturing and distribution agreement with DPSG.  We also paid $05 billion to acquire WBD American Depositary Shares (ADS) in the open market.  We anticipate capital spending in 2012 of approximately $30 billion.

Financing Activities During 2011,  net cash used for financing activities was $51 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments of $56 billion,  our purchase of an additional $14 billion of WBD ordinary shares (including shares underlying ADSs) and our repurchase of certain WBD debt obligations of $08 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $14 billion and stock option proceeds of $09 billion.

In 2011 and 2010,  management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  In 2009,  management operating cash flow was used primarily to pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global and capital credit markets.  However,  see 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agencyespecially any downgrade to below investment grade,  could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  In addition,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial 
paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,  and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  See 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Our Business Risks" and Note 9.  Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 9 for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  Additionally,  we do not enter into off-balance-sheet transactions specifically structured to provide income or tax benefits or to avoid recognizing or disclosing assets or liabilities.

method will enhance the comparability of QFNA is financial results with our other food businesses,  as well as with peer companies where the average cost method is widely used.  The impact of this change on consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $9 million (or less than a penny per share).  Prior periods were not restated as the impact of the change on previously issued financial statements was not considered material.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilities,  are included in cost of sales.  The costs of moving,  storing and delivering finished product are included in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  tax reserves,  stock-based compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands,  goodwill and other long-lived assets.  We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience,  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances,  such as current economic conditions,  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change.  As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis,  most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis.  The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule in 2011,  reflecting the extra week in the fourth quarter this year: 
Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In addition,  we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest,  our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  In 2011,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  On February 26,  2010,  we completed our acquisitions of The Pepsi Bottling Group,  Inc.  (PBG) and PepsiAmericas,  Inc.  (PAS).  The results of the acquired companies in the U.S.  and Canada are reflected in our consolidated results as of the acquisition date,  and the international results of the acquired companies have been reported as of the beginning of our second quarter of 2010,  consistent with our monthly international reporting calendar.  The results of the acquired companies in the U.S.,  Canada and Mexico are reported within our PAB segment,  and the results of the acquired companies in Europe,  including Russia,  are reported within our Europe segment.  Prior to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we recorded our share of equity income or loss from the acquired companies in bottling equity income in our income statement.  Our share of income or loss from other noncontrolled affiliates is reflected as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Additionally,  in the first quarter of 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 million,  comprising $735 million which was non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.  See Notes 8 and 15 and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results,  see 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  the results of our Venezuelan businesses are reported under hyperinflationary accounting.  See 'Our Business Risks" and 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  In the first quarter of 2011,  Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) changed its method of accounting for certain U.S.  inventories from the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method.  This change is considered preferable by management as we believe that the average cost method of accounting for all U.S.  foods inventories will improve our financial reporting by better matching revenues and expenses and better reflecting the current value of inventory.  In addition,  the change from the LIFO method to the average cost

Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at a fixed discount rate,  as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension plan amendments and gains and losses due to demographics,  including salary experience,  are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costs,  measured at a fixed discount rate,  for retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension plans,  pension asset returns and the impact of pension funding,  and gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  In addition,  corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7.

Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions.  For additional unaudited information on our divisions,  see 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for the following allocation methodologies: t TUPDLCBTFEDPNQFOTBUJPOFYQFOTF t QFOTJPOBOESFUJSFFNFEJDBMFYQFOTFBOE t EFSJWBUJWFT Stock-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2011 was approximately 15% to FLNA,  2% to QFNA,  4% to LAF,  31% to PAB,  12% to Europe,  9% to AMEA and 27% to corporate unallocated expenses.  We had similar allocations of stock-based compensation expense to our divisions in 2010 and 2009.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  
Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include metals,  energy and agricultural products.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.  Operating Profit(a)

Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that our consumers receive the product quality and freshness that they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-ofdate products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customersincluding Wal-Mart.  In 2011,  Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 11% of our total net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  
Deferred advertising costs of $163 million and $158 million at year-end 2011 and 2010,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $92 billion in 2011$77 billion in 2010 and $56 billion in 2009.  
Sales Incentives and Other Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to our customers and consumers.  Sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $346 billion in 2011,  $291 billion in 2010 and $129 billion in 2009.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one yearcertain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rights,  may extend beyond one year.

Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software,  (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internaluse computer software.  Capitalized software costs are included in property,  plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which approximate five to 10 years.  Software amortization totaled $156 million in 2011,  $137 million in 2010 and $119 million in 2009.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $13 billion as of December 31,  2011 and $11 billion as of December 25,  2010.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE).  Among other things,  the new guidance requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  In addition,  the amended guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary.  The provisions of this guidance were effective as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In the second quarter of 2010,  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law.  The PPACA changes the tax treatment related to an existing retiree drug subsidy (RDS) available to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D.  As a result of the PPACA,  RDS payments will effectively become taxable in tax years beginning in 2013,  by requiring the amount of the subsidy received to be offset against our deduction for health care expenses.  The provisions of the PPACA required us to record the effect of this tax law change beginning in our second quarter of 2010,  and consequently we recorded a onetime related tax charge of $41 million in the second quarter of 2010.  We continue to evaluate the longer-term impacts of this legislation.  In June 2011,  the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability,  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income.  The new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.  In December 2011,  the FASB approved a deferral of the effective date of certain requirements related to the presentation and disclosure of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income.  The provisions of the retained guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In September 2011,  the FASB issued new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test.  An entity would continue to perform the historical first step of the impairment test if it fails the qualitative assessment,  while no further analysis would be required if it passes.  The provisions of the new guidance are effective for our 2012 goodwill impairment test.  
Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  certain taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9.  Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth in these activities and to drive innovation globally.  These activities principally involve the development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing products,  improvement and modernization of production processes,  and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $525 million in 2011$488 million in 2010 and $414 million in 2009 and are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our financial statements.  In September 2011,  the FASB amended its guidance regarding the disclosure requirements for employers participating in multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans (multiemployer plans) to improve transparency and increase awareness of the commitments and risks involved with participation in multiemployer plans.  The new accounting guidance requires employers participating in multiemployer plans to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to provide users with more detailed information regarding an employer is involvement in multiemployer plans.  The provisions of this new guidance were effective as of the beginning of our 2011 fiscal year.  We have reviewed our level of participation in multiemployer plans and determined that the impact of adopting this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In December 2011,  the FASB issued new disclosure requirements that are intended to enhance current disclosures on offsetting financial assets and liabilities.  The new disclosures require an entity to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments eligible for offset on the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.  The provisions of the new disclosure requirements are effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our financial statements.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years,  based on existing intangible assets as of December 31,  2011 and using average 2011 foreign exchange rates,  is expected to be $122 million in 2012,  $113 million in 2013,  $98 million in 2014,  $89 million in 2015 and $81 million in 2016.  Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on discounted future cash flows.  Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.

While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results. " in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  As of December 31,  2011,  the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in other liabilities,  was $2167 million.

compensation expense and $53 million was included in merger and integration charges.  $86 million of the $352 million recorded in 2010 was related to the unvested acquisition-related grants described below.  Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense and recognized in earnings were $101 million in 2011,  $89 million in 2010 and $67 million in 2009.  At year-end 2011136 million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.  In connection with our acquisition of PBG in 2010,  we issued 134 million stock options and 27 million RSUs at weighted-average grant prices of $4289 and $6230,  respectively,  to replace previously held PBG equity awards.  In connection with our acquisition of PAS in 2010,  we issued 04 million stock options at a weightedaverage grant price of $3172 to replace previously held PAS equity awards.  Our equity issuances included 83 million stock options and 06 million RSUs which were vested at the acquisition date and were included in the purchase price.  The remaining 55 million stock options and 21 million RSUs issued were unvested at the issuance date and are being amortized over their remaining vesting periodup to three years from the issuance date.  As a result of our annual benefits review in 2010,  the Company approved certain changes to our benefits programs to remain market competitive relative to other leading global companies.  These changes included ending the Company is broad-based SharePower stock option program.  Consequently,  beginning in 2011,  no new awards were granted under the SharePower program.  Outstanding SharePower awards from 2010 and earlier continue to vest and are exercisable according to the terms and conditions of the program.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding other related changes.  
Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $100 billion at year-end 2011 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $01 billion in 2012,  $82 billion between 2013 and 2031 and $17 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  We do not backdate,  reprice or grant stock-based compensation awards retroactively.  Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance are generally offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and,  through 2011,  are granted 50% stock options and 50% performance-based RSUs.  Beginning in 2012,  senior officers will be granted 60% market stock units and 40% long-term cash awards,  each of which will be subject to pre-established performance targets.  Vesting of RSU awards for senior officers is contingent upon the achievement of preestablished performance targets approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  RSU expense is based on the 
Undistributed International Earnings As of December 31,  2011,  we had approximately $341 billion of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  therefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  Note 6 
Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  Stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  the only stock-based plan under which we currently grant stock options and RSUs.  Stock-based compensation expense was $343 million in 2011,  $352 million in 2010 and $227 million in 2009.  In 2011,  $326 million was recorded as stockbased compensation expense,  $13 million was included in merger and integration charges and $4 million was included in restructuring charges.  In 2010,  $299 million was recorded as stock-based 65

Our pension plans cover certain full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  Certain U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the costs.  Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions,  including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets,  and from changes in our assumptions are determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 10 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.  In connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we assumed sponsorship of pension and retiree medical plans that provide benefits to certain U.S.  and international employees.  Subsequentlyduring the third quarter of 2010,  we merged the pension plan assets of the legacy PBG and PAS U.S.  pension plans with those of PepsiCo into one master trust.  During 2010,  the Compensation Committee of PepsiCo is Board of Directors approved certain changes to the U.S.  pension and retiree medical plans,  effective January 1,  2011.

equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%.  Our 2011 target investment allocation was 40% for U.S.  equity,  20% for international equity and 40% for fixed income.  For 2012,  our target allocations are as follows: 40% for fixed income33% for U.S.  equity,  22% for international equity and 5% for real estate.  The change to the 2012 target asset allocations was made to increase diversification.  Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy,  our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience.  We also review 
These future benefits to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded pension plans.  In 2012,  we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $13 billion,  with up to approximately $1 billion expected to be discretionary.  Our net cash payments for retiree medical are estimated to be approximately $124 million in 2012.  Plan Assets Pension Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of 
PepsiCo,  Inc.  2011 Annual Report 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value.  For all other asset categories,  we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  
retiree medical claims.  In 2010,  we made a discretionary contribution of $170 million to fund future U.S.  retiree medical plan benefits.  This contribution was invested consistent with the allocation of existing assets in the U.S.  pension plan.  Fair Value The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value,  establishes a framework for measuring fair value,  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets.  Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value,  whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.

Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 7% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2012.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2020 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability.  However,  the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.  In addition,  as of January 1,  2011,  the Company started phasing out Company subsidies of retiree medical benefits.  A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects: 1% Increase

Prior to the completion of our acquisitions of PBG and PAS on February 26,  2010,  our significant related party transactions were primarily with PBG and PAS,  as well as with other noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Related party transactions in 2011 are not material as we now consolidate PBG and PAS.  All such transactions were settled on terms consistent with other trade receivables and payables.  The transactions primarily consisted of (1) selling concentrate to these affiliates,  which they use in the production of CSDs and non-carbonated beverages,  (2) selling certain finished goods to these affiliates,  (3) receiving royalties for the use of our trademarks for certain products and (4) paying these affiliates to act as our manufacturing and distribution agent for product associated with our national account fountain customers.  Sales of concentrate and finished goods are reported net of bottler funding.  For further unaudited information on these bottlers,  see 'Our Customers" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  These transactions with our bottling affiliates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as follows: 
Savings Plan Certain U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans,  which are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement,  and we make Company matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  In 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we also made Company retirement contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  As of January 1,  2011,  a new employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan became effective for certain eligible legacy PBG and PAS salaried employees as well as all eligible salaried new hires of PepsiCo who are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan as a result of plan design changes approved during 2010.  In 2011 and 2010,  our total Company contributions were $144 million and $135 million,  respectively.  As of February 2012,  certain U.S.  employees earning a benefit under one of our defined benefit pension plans will no longer be eligible for the Company matching contributions on their 401(k) contributions.

(a) Includes transactions with PBG and PAS in 2010 prior to the date of acquisition.  2010 balance sheet information for PBG and PAS is not applicable as we consolidated their balance sheets at the date of acquisition.  
We also coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the contract negotiations of sweeteners and other raw material requirements,  including aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for certain of our independent bottlers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting party,  we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  In addition,  our joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks sell finished goods (ready-to-drink teascoffees and water products) to our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Consistent with accounting for equity method investments,  our joint venture revenue is not included in our consolidated net revenue and therefore is not included in the above table.  In 2010,  we repurchased $357 million (55 million shares) of PepsiCo stock from the Master Trust which holds assets of PepsiCo is U.S.  qualified pension plans at market value.  
Related Party Transactions On February 26,  2010,  we completed our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  at which time we gained control over their operations and began to consolidate their results.  See Notes 1 and 15.  Prior to these acquisitions,  PBG and PAS represented our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Sales to PBG (prior to the acquisition date) represented less than 1% of our total net revenue in 2010 and 6% of our total net revenue in 2009.

We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $35 billion.  Additionally,  we may,  once a year,  request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period.  Also,  in the third quarter of 2011,  we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires in June 2012.  Effective August 8,  2011,  commitments under this agreement were increased to enable us to borrow up to $2925 billion,  subject to customary terms and conditions.  We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $35 billion.  We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year,  which would mature no later than June 2013.  The Four-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement,  together replaced our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement,  our $2575 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement and our $1080 billion amended PBG credit facility.

In the third quarter of 2011,  we paid $784 million in a cash tender offer to repurchase $766 million (aggregate principal amount) of certain WBD debt obligations.  As a result of this debt repurchasewe recorded a $16 million charge to interest expense (included in merger and integration charges) in the third quarter,  primarily representing the premium paid in the tender offer.  In addition,  as of December 31,  2011,  $848 million of our debt related to borrowings from various lines of credit that are primarily maintained for our international divisions.

Most long-term contractual commitments,  except for our longterm debt obligations,  are not recorded on our balance sheet.  Non-cancelable operating leases primarily represent building leases.  Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for sugar and other sweeteners,  packaging materials,  oranges and orange juice.  Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing.  Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis.  Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments because they do not represent expected future cash outflows.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations.  
cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction,  we recognize the related gain or loss in net income immediately.  We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularlyincluding a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.  
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.  See Note 8 regarding contracts related to certain of our bottlers.  See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orders,  pricing agreements and derivatives.  In addition,  risk to our supplies of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for metalsenergy and agricultural products.  For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in corporate unallocated expenses.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $59 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market each period and reflected in our income statement.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $598 million as of December 31,  2011 and $590 million as of December 25,  2010.  Ineffectiveness for our commodity hedges is not material.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $630 million as of December 31,  2011 and $266 million as of December 25,  2010.  
Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: t DPNNPEJUZQSJDFT BòFDUJOHUIFDPTUPGPVSSBXNBUFSJBMT and energyt GPSFJHOFYDIBOHFSJTLT BOE t JOUFSFTUSBUFT In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a result,  any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related gain or loss and then include it as a component of the 
Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity as currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate approximately 50% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom comprising approximately 23% of our net revenue.  As a 73

to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness has been swapped to floating rates.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  The notional amounts of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31,  2011 and December 25,  2010 were $833 billion and $923 billion,  respectively.  For those interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accountingany ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  Ineffectiveness for our interest rate hedges is not material.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these interest rate derivative instruments consistent with the underlying hedged item.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $16 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  As of December 31,  2011,  approximately 38% of total debt,  after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments,  was exposed to variable rates,  compared to 43% as of December 25,  2010.  
result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  We also enter into derivatives,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years,  to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $23 billion as of December 31,  2011 and $17 billion as of December 252010.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net gains of $20 million related to foreign currency contracts that qualify for hedge accounting from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Additionally,  ineffectiveness for our foreign currency hedges is not material.  For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  all losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swapscross-currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks

Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 259 million shares in 2011,  244 million shares in 2010 and 390 million shares in 2009 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.  Out-of-the-money options had average exercise prices of $6699 in 2011,  $6726 in 2010 and $6152 in 2009.

WBD On February 3,  2011,  we acquired the ordinary shares,  including shares underlying ADSs and Global Depositary Shares (GDS)of WBD,  a company incorporated in the Russian Federationwhich represented in the aggregate approximately 66% of WBD is outstanding ordinary shares,  pursuant to the purchase agreement dated December 1,  2010 between PepsiCo and certain selling shareholders of WBD for approximately $38 billion in cash.  The acquisition of those shares increased our total ownership to approximately 77%,  giving us a controlling interest in WBD.  Under the guidance on accounting for business combinations,  once a controlling interest is obtained,  we are required to recognize and measure 100% of the identifiable assets acquired,  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests at their full fair values.  The following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of WBD and the resulting goodwill as of the acquisition date: Fair value of total consideration transferred Payment in cash,  for the approximately 66% of outstanding ordinary shares of WBD on February 3,  2011,  including shares underlying ADSs and GDSs (or $2428,  net of cash and cash equivalents acquired) Fair value of our previously held equity interest in WBD prior to the acquisition Total Acquisition date fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Inventories Property,  plant and equipment Amortizable intangible assets,  primarily customer relationships Nonamortizable intangible assets,  primarily brands and tradename Other current assets and liabilities(a) Debt obligations Other noncurrent assets and liabilities Deferred income taxes Total identifiable net assets Fair value of noncontrolling interest in WBD Goodwill Total 
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred,  any noncontrolling interest and any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets recognized.  The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of WBD primarily reflects the value of adding economies of scale from our existing manufacturing and procurement operations in Russia and synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios in the nutrition and other categories,  as well as any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.  Goodwill is not amortizable or deductible for tax purposes.  All of the goodwill is recorded in our Europe segment.  Under the guidance on accounting for business combinationsmerger and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred.  See Note 3 for details on the expenses incurred during 2011 and 2010.  On March 10,  2011,  we commenced our tender offers in Russia and the U.S.  for all remaining outstanding ordinary shares and ADSs of WBD for 388370 Russian rubles per ordinary share and 970925 Russian rubles per ADS,  respectively.  The Russian offer was made to all holders of ordinary shares and the U.S.  offer was made to all holders of ADSs.  We completed the Russian offer on May 19,  2011 and the U.S.  offer on May 16,  2011.  After completion of the offers,  we paid approximately $13 billion for WBD is ordinary shares (including shares underlying ADSs) and increased our total ownership of WBD to approximately 986%.  On June 30,  2011,  we elected to exercise our squeeze-out rights under Russian law with respect to all remaining WBD ordinary shares not already owned by us.  Therefore,  under Russian law,  all remaining WBD shareholders were required to sell their ordinary shares (including those underlying ADSs) to us at the same price that was offered to WBD shareholders in the Russian tender offer.  Accordingly,  all registered holders of ordinary shares on August 152011 (including the ADS depositary) received 388370 Russian rubles per ordinary share.  After completion of the squeeze-out in September 2011 (during our fourth quarter),  we paid approximately $79 million for WBD is ordinary shares (including shares underlying ADSs) and increased our total ownership to 100% of WBD.
