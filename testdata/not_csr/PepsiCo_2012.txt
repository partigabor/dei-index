Dear Fellow ShareholdersRunning a company for the long term is like driving a car in a race that has no end.  To win a long raceyou must take a pit stop every now and then to refresh and refuel your car,  tune your engine and take other actions that will make you even faster,  stronger and more competitive over the long term.  That is what we did in 2012—we refreshed and refueled our growth engine to help drive superior financial returns in the years ahead.  We invested significantly behind our brands.  We changed the operating model of our company from a loose federation of countries and regions to a more globally integrated one to enable us to build our brands globally,  deliver breakthrough innovation to consumers and unleash significant productivity.  Simply put,  we took actions that we believe set ourselves up for long-term sustainable growth and superior performance.  I am delighted to report that our performance in 2012 reflected our operational excellence and was in line with our expectations and guidance on every key metric:

2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
	 Our organic revenue was up 5 percent;1 	 Core earnings per share (eps) were $410;2 
	 We delivered +$1 billion savings in the first year of our productivity program and remain on track to deliver $3 billion by 2015; 	 We achieved a core net return on invested capital3 (roic) of 15 percent and core return on equity3 (roe) of 28 percent; 	 Management operating cash flow, 4 excluding certain itemsreached $74 billion; and 	 $65 billion was returned to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  The actions we took in 2012 were all designed to take us one step further on the transformation journey of our company,  which we started in 2007.  Back then,  we recognized that the market environment was rapidly shifting around us.  We realized that in order to stay in front,  we would need to make significant changes.  We set ourselves a dual challenge—to renew our highly successful company to position it for long-term advantage and growth while continuing to deliver strong and consistent financial results during the transformation.  We have eagerly embraced this challenge and made the required investments.  Our journey to date has shown significant results.  We have reinforced our existing 
business while also shifting our portfolio to attractive growth spaces.  We have built out the key capabilities we need to compete in the future.  We have raised our capacity to drive continuous productivity.  We have strengthened our talent pool across the organization,  and,  by no means least,  we have embedded our vision of Performance with Purpose into all of our actions and practices.  That is what we have achieved so far,  and it is considerable.  We are an exciting company with a strong foundation and track record.  But as I look forward into 2013 and beyond,  it is clear that we still have further to go on our journey.  Our transformation must continue.  
The Environment in Which We Operate 
Over the past several years,  a number of forces have combined to radically reshape the external environment in which the food and beverage industry operates.  These changes have had a major impact on where and how companies must compete to survive and thrive.  Global macroeconomic growth has slowed significantly,  and the outlook remains mixed,  particularly in developed markets.  Global economic power is becoming more distributed,  with the East becoming a larger player in the world.  The demographic equation in the West is shifting,  with an increasing share of consumption in the hands of boomers,  women and smaller households,  and rapid growth 
of diverse ethnic and immigrant communities across countries.  Intensifying consumer and government focus on health and wellness is changing the relative growth trajectory of our categories and products.  Consumers are clearly changing their habits,  preferences and consumption patterns.  Food safety and security are now front and center in the minds of governments and consumers,  increasing the need for robust systems within companies to ensure ingredient and product traceability.  Sustained commodity price increases and volatility have challenged company cost structures.  Meanwhile,  there is a strong and growing environmental consciousness emerging in societies around the world as the focus on water use,  waste disposal (especially of plastic) and energy use by industry receives additional scrutiny.  Lastly,  the global retail environment is transforming.  In emerging and developing markets,  the growth of organized modern trade is beginning to slowly replace traditional mom and pop stores,  and in developed markets,  new discount channels like hard discounters and dollar stores are rapidly growing.  Additionally,  online retailing is beginning to make inroads into our categories while social media amplifies positive messages and rumors in the blink of an eye.  The combination of these shifts has put considerable pressure on the

food and beverage industry.  The growth outlook in some developed markets and categories has slowed significantly,  while emerging and developing markets require new skills for success.  Traditional approaches and legacy capabilities are no longer sufficient to compete in these spaces.  But these changes also have given rise to unparalleled opportunities for PepsiCo.  For one,  the convenience trend is accelerating around the worlddriving the growth of our categories.  The strong outlook in emerging and developing markets for all our products and the demand for Goodfor-You products and categories in key markets also present major growth opportunities.  Other potential new areas of expansion for us are premium-priced products,  products for aging populations and value offerings for those with lower incomes.  As a global company with positions in every key market in the worldPepsiCo is sheer scale as well as product and geographic diversity give us the ability to power through country-specific trends and still deliver superior returns.  Our iconic brands are trusted in every country to deliver a quality product that meets the highest global safety standards.  Our track record of ethical performance and quality products provides comfort to consumers and governments the world over.  
Our Transformation 
Back in 2007,  we recognized the rapidly changing environment and realized we needed new capabilities to compete.  We made the required investments to preemptively transform ourselves to capitalize on these opportunities and position the 4	 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
company for long-term growth and profitability in this volatile and challenging environment.  1.  We Reinforced Our Existing Value Drivers We refocused our efforts on our key global brands and categories in our most important developed markets to drive profitable growth.  We are the 1 macrosnack player in many developed markets in the world.  Our highly profitable snacks business has a strong stable of much-loved megabrands—Lay isDoritos,  Cheetos and SunChips—and a structurally advantaged go-to-market system in many major markets such as the U.S.,  Canada,  the U.K.  and Australia,  among others.  We have been concentrating our insightsmarketing and innovation resources behind our powerhouse brands and key markets to successfully grow demand and our share.  As a result of our consistent investments over the years,  Lay is is the 1 snack food brand in the world; Lay isDoritos and Cheetos are lovemarks in many countries in which they operate,  and a brand such as Tostitos in the U.S.  makes party time come alive.  We also have taken crowdsourcing of ideas to a new and exciting place: Our Lay is 'Do Us A Flavor" campaign engages consumers directly through social media to co-create new exciting flavors.  Launched in the U.K.,  this campaign has been extended to 17 marketsincluding the U.S.  in 2012.  To datewe have received 19 million flavor ideas from around the world! We also have leveraged social media in our consistently strong Doritos 'Crash the Super Bowl" cam paign,  which puts fan-developed ads on air during the big game.  In 2012,  Doritos fan-created ads placed first on the traditional and online Ad Meter ranking.  In 2013a 'Crash the Super Bowl" Doritos fan-created ad ranked 1 as 'most liked" and 'most memorable" in the Nielsen ratings.  Most importantly,  our goal is to make the best savory snacks in the market.  We eliminated the use of partially hydrogenated cooking oils used to make savory snacks in North America,  dramatically reducing trans fats.  Additionally,  we have reduced saturated fat levels and are reducing the sodium content of our savory snacks,  and we are dialing up baked offerings.  Our developed market beverage business remains large and profitable.  Across our major beverage markets,  we revamped our investment to strengthen our key global beverage brands,  which include Pepsi,  Mountain Dew,  Sierra Mist7UP (outside the U.S. ),  Starbucks and Lipton.  We bought back bottlers in North America and Europe to unlock large,  underexploited system synergies in these mature carbonated soft drink (CSD) markets.  We also have taken the right measures to step up the performance of our North America beverage business,  where we are the 1 liquid refreshment beverage (LRB) player in measured channels.  We have made major changes to our team,  operating model and marketing approach to better adapt to a new consumer and competitive environment.  We are dialing up our support on zero-calorie products and offering reducedcalorie CSDs,  like Pepsi NEXT which became a $100 million brand at retail in less than 12 months.  In 2012,  we continued this transformation by simplifying the business and reinvesting heavily behind our key brands while unlocking new sources of productivity.  2.  We Migrated Our Portfolio Towards AttractiveHigh-Growth Spaces Very early,  we recognized the growth prospects in the Goodfor-You space.  We invested to expand it across multiple markets globally,  increasing our presence in the growing tasty nutrition space.  We are building from our positions of strength with four of the most important platforms and globally admired and loved brands in nutrition—Quaker (grains),  Tropicana (fruits and vegetables),  Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes) and Naked Juice (super-premium juices and protein smoothies).  We also are working to unlock growth opportunities in new product categoriessuch as dairy with our business in Russia,  our joint venture with Almarai in parts of the Middle East and our Müller Quaker Dairy joint venture in the U.S. ; hummus and other fresh dips with Sabra and Obela; and baked grains with Stacy is.  We established a Global Nutrition Group to drive innovation and brand development,  and are concentrating our investments in high-potential return markets and categories.  We had great success in 2012,  with more to come.  We launched Quaker Real Medleys in the U.S.,  pairing oatmeal with other whole grainsfruits and nuts in a portable cup and portion-controlled serving,  which drove our growth in hot cereal retail sales.  Quaker Real Medleys recently 
won breakfast Product of the Yearthe largest consumer-voted award recognizing outstanding innovation.  Trop 50 reduced-calorie orange juice continues its terrific retail growth momentum in measured channels.  We also introduced Tropicana Farmstand,  enabling U.S.  consumers to get a serving of both fruit and vegetables in an eight-ounce glass.  And Gatorade delivered innovation,  with Gatorade Prime Energy Chews fueling athletic performance as well as Gatorade retail sales.  Importantly,  our efforts to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for convenient nutrition are global.  The growth of our Quaker business is a case in point: Last yearwe increased Quaker retail sales in the U.K.  with the success of Oats so Simple,  grew Quaker volume in China and India with breakfast foods customized for local tastes,  and leveraged Quaker is expertise in Russia by launching oats under our local Chudo brand.  From 2002 to 2012,  our nutrition business revenue has grown substantially and in 2012 represented 20 percent of our company.  Emerging and developing markets represent another very attractive high-growth opportunity for PepsiCo.  Economic growth is lifting consumers' income levels and driving urban lifestyles.  More women are entering the workforce.  This,  in turn,  is increasing the demand for convenient foods and beverages,  providing tailwinds to our categories.  Over the past six years,  we have invested aggressively to bolster our presence in these markets.  Our investments included: 
Important acquisitions,  such as Lebedyansky and the Wimm-BillDann juice and dairy business in Russia,  Mabel cookies and Lucky snacks in Brazil,  and Dilexis cookies in Argentina,  to name a few.  Strategic partnerships to improve scale and performance,  such as Tingyi in China,  which makes us part of the leading beverage system in the largest growth market; the consolidation of our bottling system in Mexico under a new joint venture to increase our scale and step up our capabilities; the strategic partnership for dairy and juice with AlmaraiSaudi Arabia is largest food producer; and the fortified water joint venture with Tata in India to serve the value consumer.  Organic investments to sustain and improve share,  through stepped-up marketplace spending on media,  racks,  or routes in countries such as Mexico,  BrazilRussia and China.  In addition,  we established the Global Value Innovation Center in India to significantly reduce the cost of our marketplace equipment (e.g.,  coolers and fountain dispensers) to enable us to increase our investments in emerging markets in an affordable way.  The early results are very promising.  Our targeted investments have helped us build advantaged positions in these markets: We are the 1 food and beverage business in Russia,  1 in India and 1 in the Middle Eastplus 2 in Mexico and in the top 5 in Brazil,  Turkey and many smaller emerging markets,  such as Vietnamthe Philippines and Thailand.  Looking back to 2006,  emerging and developing markets accounted 2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT	 
for 24 percent of our net revenue; in 2012,  they represented 35 percent of our net revenue.  And over the long term,  we are looking to grow our business in these markets at high single digits to low double digits.  3.  We Accelerated the Benefits of One PepsiCo PepsiCo is strength lies in the fact that our portfolio is diverse,  but related.  The convenient snack and beverage businesses have high levels of coincidence of purchase and consumption and very high velocities at the shelf.  We believe this portfolio complementarity provides a natural hedge,  allowing us to manage through individual category issues and still deliver good returns.  Our portfolio provides us three additional major benefits.  
experiences,  allowing us to build a world-class workforce.  We 'lift and shift" best practices across the value chain.  For example,  the expertise we have developed in increasing yields while conserving water helps us get more crop per drop in our agricultural operations throughout the world,  be it potatoes or corn for our snacks,  or fruits and vegetables for our juice business.  Because of the high coincidence of consumption of our productswe have developed a common consumer demand framework underpinned by a global database,  giving us proprietary insights into food and beverage occasions.  This guides our innovation actions at the global and local level.  
First,  cost leverage: We are an important customer to key vendors in the food and beverage space.  We have preferred partner status with many of them,  which allows us to strategically make use of each other is supply chains and development efforts to meaningfully reduce our input costs while accessing their best talent and advanced thinking.  
Third,  commercial benefits: As the second-largest food and beverage business in the world and the largest in the U.S.,  we are traffic generators and therefore viewed as a critical growth driver by retailers.  Just in the U.S.,  we have nine of the top 40 trademarks at retailmore than any other food and beverage company.  
Additionally,  inside PepsiCo,  across businesses,  we share infrastructure including corporate functions,  master data and back office processingfurther lowering our costs.  
Retailers benefit from our in-store promotions that leverage powerful properties such as the National Football League,  Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League in the U.S. ; talented soccer players like Lionel Messi,  who appeared in both Pepsi and Lay is commercial activities globally; as well as through mini-films like the 'Bring Happiness Home" Chinese New Year production that brought together Lay is,  Tropicana and Pepsi to deliver an emotional public ser Second,  capability sharing: Over the past few years,  we have harmonized many of our processes,  making it easier to move talent across the company—both businesses and geographies.  We are able to attract world-class talent and give them a truly diverse,  but related set of 6	 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
vice message to Chinese consumers—Go home to your families for Chinese New Year.  This film garnered more than 700 million views in China alone.  All these activities increased coincidence of purchases between beverages and snacks and our healthy breakfast bundles,  and in 2012,  made us the second-largest growth contributor in all measured U.S.  retail channels combined.  Foodservice customers are also beginning to benefit from the power of PepsiCo is portfolio: Taco Bell in the U.S.  is a case in point.  For more than 45 years,  we have been their beverage partner of choice.  Mountain Dew 'Baja Blast, " a flavor developed exclusively for Taco Bellhas been a best-selling traffic driver in its system since launch.  In 2012building on this beverage relationship,  we partnered with Taco Bell to introduce Doritos Locos Tacosa taco with a shell made from real Nacho Cheese Doritos that has become the restaurant is biggest success in its 50-year history.  In nine months alone,  Taco Bell sold more than 325 million Doritos Locos Tacos—one of the most successful new products in the foodservice industry in 2012.  In 2013,  we expect to continue building on this success,  with the launch of Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos.  More importantly,  we are innovating now on the beverage front with the launch of Mountain Dew 'Baja Blast Freeze. " The pairing of the Doritos and Mountain Dew brands is a natural: In the U.S.  convenience channelDoritos is the number one salty snack,  while Mountain Dew is the number one single-serve carbonated soft drink.  
An example of a market where we truly leverage the cost,  capability and commercial benefits from our broad portfolio is Russia.  Our business is operated as an integrated wholewith shared offices,  infrastructuretalent,  supply chain and go-to-market systems.  We are an extremely efficient and effective leader in the food and beverage business in that country—lowering our costs significantly and expanding the reach of our products several fold.  We believe our whole is worth more than the sum of our parts.  It is our Power of One.  4.  We Are Aggressively Building New Capabilities PepsiCo has historically been managed as a loose federation of countries and regions.  This organizational structure fostered an entrepreneurial culture in the company,  not necessarily a culture of global efficiency.  Starting in 2010 and accelerating in 2012,  we began to modify our global operating model,  balancing independence and scale,  to become a globally networked company.  Our in-country and regional teams are empowered to serve their marketsbut through global groups and functions,  we are harmonizing our efforts across the world around brand building,  innovation and the management of our supply chain.  Our new model already has begun to yield results.  Our global category groups are guiding regions to rationalize their brand portfolios and focus the bulk of our spending behind 12 global brands.  We are continuing to increase the caliber of our global marketing talent and implementing global campaigns for our iconic global brands,  beginning 
with 'Live for Now, " the first-ever global positioning campaign for brand Pepsi.  In 2012,  'Live for Now" engaged millions of consumers through music,  sports,  social media and other consumer touch points.  In December,  we announced a unique creative collaboration with 17-time Grammy Award winning singer Beyoncé to work with us on creating content to engage Pepsi consumers around the world.  Our brand equity scores are steadily improving,  and we are just getting started.  Our innovation efforts also have improved substantially.  Back in 2007we invested to rebuild our R&D capability in the company.  We brought in outstanding talent and created new long-term research capabilities.  We increased our investment behind natural sweeteners,  disruptive processes,  packaging and nutrition platforms.  We are also teaching our people how to leverage R&D in intelligent ways to create platforms for growth rather than just one-off line extensions.  We also have taken other major actions to drive innovation.  In 2012for the first time in PepsiCo,  we created a design capability in the company.  Our goal is to use design in the early stages of innovation efforts to create memorable products and experiences for our consumers.  We also have put in place a common stage-gate process to facilitate data-driven decision making.  We created the capability to lift and shift ideas across the various countries within PepsiCo.  Examples include the launch of Lay is 'Do Us A Flavor Campaign" in the U.S.  after its success in Europe,  Asia,  South America and Africa; our continued expansion 
in the cookie and biscuits category in Brazil,  Argentina,  the Middle East and the Philippines,  building on the strengths of our Gamesa-Quaker business in Mexico; and the success of Quaker Yogurt Bars in the U.S.  after their development in Canada.  Thanks to all these initiatives,  at the end of 2012,  innovation from products launched in the past three years accounted for approximately eight percent of our net revenue.  Going forward,  we intend to continue to leverage R&D to help us develop more breakthrough innovation that delivers true incremental growth and is sustainable.  To draw from creative expertise in every corner of the world,  in 2012 we opened new R&D centers in Shanghai,  China; Hamburg,  Germany; and Monterrey,  Mexico.  Our global supply chain group has been working on best practice transfer across our enterprise,  bringing in breakthrough thinking from external sources to lower our costs and create more capacity and flexibility in our supply chain.  We are rigorously analyzing,  auditing and benchmarking the performance of our facilities and using what we learn to strengthen our manufacturing,  distribution and go-to-market capabilities around the globe.  Our environmental sustainability agenda,  which includes waterenergy and packaging reductions,  has helped us decrease our costs while conserving natural resources.  All of these actions,  plus scores of others,  have enabled us to double our historic productivity run rate starting in 2012,  leading to a $3 billion cost take-out over three years.  We have reduced our cash conver2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT	 
sion cycle by nine days in 2012 and also found ways to reduce our net capital spending from 55 percent of net revenue in 2010 to 4 percent of net revenue in 2012,  which is consistent with our long-term capital spending target of less than or equal to 5 percent of net revenue.  Going forward,  we are well on our way to harmonizing our global processes,  master data and IT systems to increase visibility across the company,  ensure compliance with all our initiatives,  easily measure our progress and speed up decision making.  We intend to be one of the most efficient food and beverage companies in the world.  5.  We Are Building a Second-toNone Team and Culture In recent years,  with our transformation actions,  we truly have asked a lot of all our associates.  It is their passion,  resilience and talent that have made our progress possible.  To nurture and grow our associatesenabling them to lead PepsiCo into the future,  we have implemented award-winning talent and leadership development initiatives.  We also have been recruiting executives from outside our industry to infuse fresh thinking and bring new capabilities to our team.  I'm especially proud of the work we have done as a company to build a strong team of current and future female leaders.  As we continue to focus on developing world-class talent and teams,  PepsiCo was recognized in 2012 by the Great Place to Work Institute,  which ranked us as one of the 'World is Best Multinational Workplaces. " In addition,  Chief Executive magazine ranked PepsiCo as one of the 'Best Companies for Leaders" in 2012.  8	 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
One area that deserves mention is the great courage and humanity demonstrated by our associates.  In 2012,  whether it was in response to Hurricane Sandy in the U.S.,  the flooding in the Philippines,  political unrest and transition in Egypt or other country-specific events,  our teams have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our consumers,  customers and communities while delivering our performance goals.  There are countless stories,  and I wish I could tell them all in tribute,  because I am truly proud of our associates and humbled to be their leader.  6.  We Are Delivering on the Promise of Performance with Purpose There is a great deal of activity in PepsiCo today,  all focused on delivering sustained value.  We have seen what happens when corporate executives chase shortterm rewards to the exclusion of the long term.  No company can see itself as simply an engine for short-term growth and nothing more.  A company operates under a license from society.  Its products are regulated by public authorities.  The work of modern business encompasses partnerships with the public and non-profit sectors.  We were one of the first contemporary companies to recognize the important interdependence between corporations and society when we articulated our Performance with Purpose direction back in 2007.  Performance with Purpose is our goal to deliver sustained financial performance by providing a wide range of foods and beverages from treats to healthy eats; finding innovative ways to minimize our impact 
on the environment and lower our costs through energy and water conservation,  as well as reduced use of packaging material; providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our employees globally; and by respecting,  supporting and investing in the local communities in which we operate.  The progress we have made over the last six years—and in 2012 in particular—is heartening indeed.  We continued to grow our Good-forYou offerings,  demonstrated leadership in water conservation that was recognized with the Stockholm Industry Water Award and the U.S.  Water Prize,  and reduced our Lost Time Injury Rate by 32 percent in 2012.  These are but a few examples of the progress we have madeprogress that has led to our selection as one of the 'World is Most Admired Companies" by Fortune,  one of its most respected by Barron is and one of its most ethical by Ethisphere.  
2013 and Beyond: Our Transformation Journey Continues I am proud of what we have achieved in the last several years.  We anticipated many of the environmental changes early on and uniquely and necessarily transformed ourselves while still delivering strong results.  We have accomplished a great deal and are on the right track.  
We have clear and decisive plans to continue to reshape the business while delivering results.  Our key initiatives have not changed.  We will continue to drive profitable growth in our developed markets while continuing to migrate our portfo lio toward attractive high-growth spaces.  We will work to fully realize the benefits of our complementary categories,  capitalize on our strengthened and new capabilitiesmake every penny a prisoner,  further invest to develop the skills of our associates,  and most importantly,  accelerate our work consistent with Performance with Purpose.  
Billion Dollar Brands PepsiCo has 22 brands that each generated $1 billion or more in 2012 in estimated annual retail sales: 1 
Our current plans reaffirm our commitment to achieving outstanding results while we continue our necessary and expansive transformation journey.  This journey will not be easy,  but important work never is.  
So,  as we navigate our car around the track,  I believe we are very well positioned to run a great race,  in support of our shareholders today and for the next generation.  
Recently,  PepsiCo was referred to as a company with great character.  I am sure it is because we have endured and thrived in challenging times.  I hope it is also because we have demonstrated the courage to look beyond the immediate and our commitment to managing the company for sustainable long-term performance,  respecting and acting on the interdependence of corporations and the societies in which we operate.  
This is the very essence of Performance with Purpose.  I believe it is important now more than ever.

Our Business Executive Overview We are a leading global food and beverage company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world.  Through our operations,  authorized bottlers,  contract manufacturers and other partners,  we make,  market,  sell and distribute a wide variety of convenient and enjoyable foods and beverages,  serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.  Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition.  These indicators include market share,  volume,  net revenue,  operating profit,  management operating cash flow,  earnings per share and return on invested capital.  During 2012 we undertook a number of significant initiatives that we believe will position us for future success.  These initiatives included increasing investment in our iconic global brands; stepping up our innovation program and launching new products like Pepsi Next; and implementing a multi-year productivity program that resulted in over $1 billion in savings last year alone.  We successfully completed these initiatives while returning $65 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends during 2012.  As we look to 2013 and beyond,  we are focused on positioning our Company for long-term advantage and growth while continuing to deliver strong and consistent financial results.  Our business strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our industry,  including increasing consumer and government focus on health and wellness,  demographic shifts and retail trade consolidation,  and macroeconomic uncertainty and commodity price volatility.  We believe that many of these challenges create new opportunities for growth for our Company.  For example,  we expect that the acceleration of the convenience trend will drive continued growth in the demand for convenient foods and beverages worldwide.  In addition,  the favorable outlook in emerging and developing markets creates opportunities for growth in all of our products in those markets.  We believe that there are also potential new 36 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
categories of expansion for us in the global food and ­beverage marketplace,  such as Good-for-You and premium priced products,  products for aging populations and value offerings.  In order to address these challenges and capitalize on these opportunities,  we plan to do the following: Reinforce our existing value drivers.  We will continue to refocus our efforts on key global brands and categories in our most important developed markets to drive profitable growth.  We believe that concentrating our insights,  marketing and innovation resources behind our most significant brands in key markets will enable us to reinforce our existing competitive advantages resulting from our go-tomarket systems and strong brands,  particularly with respect to snacks,  and continue to grow demand and market share.  Migrate our portfolio towards attractive high growth categories and markets.  We plan to build on our existing efforts in the Good-for-You space to continue to grow our nutrition business by growing our most admired existing nutrition brands,  including QuakerTropicana and Gatorade.  Our efforts to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for convenient nutrition are global.  We are also working to unlock opportunities in new product categories through our dairy business in Russia and our Müller Quaker Dairy joint venture in the United States,  our Sabra dips joint venture and our Stacy is baked grain snack business.  We believe emerging and developing markets represent another very attractive high growth space for PepsiCo.  Economic growth in these markets is lifting consumer income levels and driving urban lifestyles,  which is in turn increasing demand for convenient foods and beverages.  We expect to continue to invest aggressively for advantaged growth in emerging and developing markets,  such as through tuck-in acquisitions like Mabel cookies in Brazil and through strategic partnerships to improve scale and performance such as our partnership with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp.  (Tingyi) in China.  Accelerate the benefits of 'Power of One. " We are focused on continuing to drive cost savings and other productivity enhancements derived from our complementary food and beverage portfolio,  which benefit both our top and bottom line.  For example,  we realize significant benefits from our cost scale across our portfolio.  We also capture productivity benefits by applying a common set of best-inclass processes,  technologies and best practices across our businesses around the globe.  In addition,  the complementary nature of our categories allows us to drive commercial activities across food and beverage to accelerate our growth within particular markets.  
Management is Discussion and Analysis

PAB is volume reflects sales to its independent distributors and retailers,  as well as the sales of beverages bearing our trademarks that bottlers have reported as sold to independent distributors and retailers.  Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality,  timing of product launches,  product mix,  bottler inventory practices and other factors.  While our revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume,  as there are independent bottlers in the supply chain,  we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our products at the consumer level.

with Tingyi under the House of Tropicana brand name.  AMEA reports two measures of volume (see Europe above).  See Note  15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our transaction with Tingyi in 2012.  
Our Distribution Network Our products are brought to market through direct-storedelivery (DSD),  customer warehouse and distributor networks.  The distribution system used depends on customer needsproduct characteristics and local trade practices.  
Our Customers Our primary customers include wholesale distributors,  foodservice distributors,  grocery stores,  convenience stores,  mass merchandisers,  membership stores and authorized independent bottlers.  We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area.  These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate,  finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality.  Since we do not sell directly to the consumer,  we rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products.  For our independent distributors and retailers,  these incentives include volume-based rebates,  product placement fees,  promotions and displays.  For our independent bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs,  such as consumer incentives,  advertising supportnew product support,  and vending and cooler equipment placement.  Consumer incentives include coupons,  pricing discounts and promotions,  and other promotional offers.  Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media.  New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support,  such as point-of-purchase materialsproduct placement fees,  media and advertising.  Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment.  The nature and type of programs vary annually.  Retail consolidation and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers.  In 2012,  sales to Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  (Wal-Mart) including Sam is Club (Sam is),  represented approximately 11% of our total net revenue.  Our top five retail customers represented approximately 30% of our 2012 North American (United States and Canada) net revenue,  with Wal-Mart (including Sam is) representing approximately 17%.  These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers.  
Direct-Store-Delivery We,  our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver snacks and beverages directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our bottlers.  DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal.  DSD is especially wellsuited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.  Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses and retail stores.  These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,  have lower turnoverand are less likely to be impulse purchases.  Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors.  Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles.  For example,  our foodservice and vending business distributes snacksfoods and beverages to restaurants,  businesses,  schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.  
Our Competition Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets.  Our beverage,  snack and food brands compete against globalregional,  local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  In many countries in which we do business,  The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor.  Other food and beverage competitors include,  but are not limited to,  Nestlé S. A.,  Danone,  DPSG,  Kellogg Company,  General Mills,  Inc.  and Mondelēz International,  Inc.  In many marketswe compete against numerous regional and local companies.  Many of our snack and food brands hold significant leadership positions in the snack and food industry worldwide.  However,  The Coca-Cola Company has significant CSD share advantage in many markets outside the United States.  Our beverage,  snack and food brands compete on the basis of price,  quality,  product variety and distribution.  Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products,  the introduction of new products

Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.  We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits,  we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.

and the effectiveness of our product packaging,  advertising campaigns and marketing programs,  including our ability to successfully adapt to a rapidly changing media environmentsuch as through use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  Although we devote significant resources to the actions mentioned above,  there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.  In addition,  both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain,  especially as to their appeal to consumers.  Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brandsas well as result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costsreduce demand for our products or result in litigation.  The conduct of our businesses,  including the production,  storage,  distribution,  sale,  advertising,  marketing,  labeling,  health and safety practices,  transportation and use of many of our products,  are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal,  state and local governmental agencies in the United States,  as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products are made,  manufactured or sold,  including in emerging and developing markets where legal and regulatory systems may be less developed.  These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may changesometimes dramatically,  as a result of political,  economic or social events.  Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling,  advertising and marketing practices; laws regarding the import of ingredients used in our products; laws regarding the import or export of our products; laws and programs aimed at reducing ingredients present in certain of our products,  including sodiumsaturated fat and added sugar; regulatory actions targeting the snack food or beverage industries such as restrictions on the sale of snack and beverage products in publicly regulated venues or restrictions on the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to purchase certain snacks or beverages; increased regulatory scrutiny of,  and increased litigation involving,  product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients in,  or attributes of,  certain of our products,  including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; taxation requirements,  including taxes that would increase the cost of our products to consumers; competition laws; employment 
laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating access to and use of water or utilities; and environmental laws,  including laws relating to the regulation of water rights and treatment.  New laws,  regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretationsor changes in any of the foregoing,  may alter the environment in which we do business and,  therefore,  may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities.  Governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where we operate may also impose new labeling,  product or production requirements,  or other restrictions.  Studies are underway by third parties to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients present in some of our productsincluding sugar,  artificial sweeteners,  as well as substances such as acrylamide that are naturally formed in a wide variety of foods when they are cooked (whether commercially or at home),  including french fries,  potato chips,  cereal,  bread and coffee.  Certain of these studies of acrylamide found that it is probable that acrylamide causes cancer in laboratory animals when consumed in extraordinary amounts.  If consumer concerns about the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients present in some of our products,  including sugarartificial sweeteners,  or acrylamide increase as a result of these studies,  other new scientific evidence,  or for any other reason,  whether or not valid,  demand for our products could decline and we could be subject to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products,  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition or results of operations.  We are also subject to Proposition 65 in California,  a law which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance listed by that State as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects.  If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold,  sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere.  In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.  Regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may also have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall,  seizure of products or other sanctions,  which could have an adverse effect on our sales or damage our reputation.  Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance,  our employees or suppliers could take actions that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations.  Violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In addition,  we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business,  as well as environmental remediation,  product liability,  toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations of businesses acquired by our subsidiaries.  Due to regulatory complexities,  uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries,  the potential exists for remediation,  liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated.  We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  See 'Our financial performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in emerging and developing markets or as a result of unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are sold. " Our financial performance could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.  The food,  snack and beverage industries in which we operate are highly competitive.  We compete with major international food,  snack and beverage companies that,  like us,  operate in multiple geographic areas,  as well as regional,  local and private label manufacturers and other value competitors.  We compete with other large companies in each of the food,  snack and beverage categories,  including Nestlé S. A.,  Danone,  Mondelēz International,  Kellogg Company,  General Mills and DPSG.  In many countries where we do business,  including the United States,  our primary beverage competitor is The Coca-Cola Company.  We compete on the basis of brand recognitiontaste,  price,  quality,  product variety,  distribution,  marketing and promotional activity,  convenience,  service and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.  If we are unable to compete effectively,  we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets.  This may have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins.  See also 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " Our financial performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in emerging and developing markets or as a result of unstable political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are sold.  Our operations outside of the United States,  particularly in Russia,  Mexico,  Canada and the United Kingdom,  contribute significantly to our revenue and profitability,  and we believe that our emerging and developing markets,  particularly China42 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
India,  Brazil and the Africa and Middle East regions,  present important future growth opportunities for us.  Howeverthere can be no assurance that our existing products,  variants of our existing products or new products that we makemanufacture,  market or sell will be accepted or successful in any particular emerging or developing market,  due to local or global competition,  product price,  cultural differences or otherwise.  If we are unable to expand our businesses in emerging and developing markets,  or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments,  particularly in Russiaas a result of economic and political conditions,  increased competition,  reduced demand for our products,  an inability to acquire or form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments or for any other reason,  our financial performance could be adversely affected.  Unstable economic or political conditions,  civil unrest or other developments and risks in the markets where our products are soldincluding in Europe,  Venezuela,  Mexico,  the Middle East and Egypt,  could also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Factors that could adversely affect our business results in these markets include: foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countrieswhich,  from time to time,  result in significant cash balances in foreign countries such as Venezuela,  and on the repatriation of funds; currency hyperinflation,  devaluation or fluctuationsuch as the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; and increased costs of business due to compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our international operations,  including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.  Bribery Act,  and adverse consequences,  such as the assessment of fines or penalties,  for failing to comply with these laws and regulations.  In addition,  disruption in these markets due to political instability or civil unrest could result in a decline in consumer purchasing power,  thereby reducing demand for our products.  See 'Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.

Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Many of the countries in which we operate,  including the United States and several of the members of the European Unionhave experienced and continue to experience unfavorable economic conditions.  Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these unfavorable economic conditionsincluding: adverse changes in interest rates,  tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets and inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic conditions such as the European sovereign debt crisis,  which may potentially impair our ability to access the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions; reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow-down in the general global economy or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional,  local or private label products or other economy products,  or to less profitable channels; impairment of assets; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/ or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans.  In addition,  we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our critical customerssuppliers and distributors and any negative impact on our critical customers,  suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  In addition,  some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions,  including U.S.  and non-U.S.  commercial banks,  insurance companies,  investment banks and other financial institutions,  may be exposed to a ratings downgrade,  bankruptcy,  liquidity,  default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.  A ratings downgradebankruptcy,  receivership,  default or similar event involving a major financial institution may limit the availability of credit or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all or,  with respect to financial institutions who are parties to our financing arrangementsleave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials which could have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs,  disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.  We and our business partners use various raw materials and other supplies in our business.  The principal ingredients we use include apple,  orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates,  aspartame,  corn,  corn sweeteners,  flavoringsflour,  grapefruit and other fruits,  oats,  oranges,  potatoes raw milk,  rice,  seasonings,  sucralose,  sugar,  vegetable and essential oils and wheat.  Our key packaging materials include plastic resins,  including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resin used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods,  aluminum used for cans,  glass bottles,  closures,  cardboard and paperboard cartons.  Fuel and natural gas are also important commodities for us due to their use in our facilities and in the trucks delivering our products.  Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced internationally and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or are in shortest supply when seasonal demand is at its peak.  We are exposed to the market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy,  including fuel.  The raw materials and energy which we use for the production of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and demand,  weather conditions,  agricultural uncertainty or governmental incentives and controls.  We purchase these materials and energy mainly in the open market.  If commodity price changes result in unexpected increases in raw materials and energy costs,  we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume,  revenue and operating results.  In addition,  we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain raw materials and energy,  including fuel.  Certain of these derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.

Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity plan or global operating model could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  We are implementing a strategic plan that we believe will position our business for future success and growth,  to allow us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food,  snack and beverage industries.  In order to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts,  it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business,  which may be limited due to capital constraints.  In addition,  it is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue 2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
to lead and execute our plan.  Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to reduce costs and improve efficiencies.  If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity plan or fail to implement it as timely as we anticipate,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  In addition,  we have launched a global operating model to improve efficiency­decision making,  innovation and brand management across the global PepsiCo organization.  If we are unable to implement this model effectively,  it may have a negative impact on our ability to deliver sustained or breakthrough innovation or to otherwise compete effectively.  Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability,  and that of our suppliers,  third-party business partners,  including our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  joint venture partners,  independent distributors and retailers,  to make,  manufacture,  distribute and sell products is critical to our success.  Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities due to any of the following could impair our ability to make,  manufacture,  transport,  distribute or sell our products: adverse weather conditions or natural disaster,  such as a hurricane,  earthquake or flooding; government action; fire; terrorism; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; pandemic; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners.  Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,  or to effectively manage such events if they occur,  could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering,  the failure to maintain high standards for product quality,  safety and integrity,  including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers,  or allegations of product quality issues,  mislabeling or contamination,  even if untruemay reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption,  causes injury or is mislabeled,  we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
issue could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time,  which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  In addition,  we operate globally,  which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations,  including,  without limitation,  anti-corruption laws and competition laws.  In the event that our employees,  bottlers or agents engage in improper activities abroad,  we may be subject to enforcement actionslitigation,  loss of sales or other consequences which may cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States and abroad.  Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following,  or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical,  social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities; the failure to achieve our goals with respect to sodiumsaturated fat and added sugar reduction or the development of our global nutrition business; health concerns about our products or particular ingredients in our products; our research and development efforts; our environmental impact,  including use of agricultural materials,  packaging,  energy use and waste management; the practices of our bottlers with respect to any of the foregoing; or our responses to any of the foregoing.  In addition,  water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to increase.  Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act,  or are perceived not to act,  responsibly with respect to water use.  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations,  to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation.  Furthermore,  the rising popularity of social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination,  and,  as a result,  negative or inaccurate posts or comments on such sites may also generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations,  as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.  See also 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activitiesincrease our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations,  or to complete or manage divestitures or refranchisingscould have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions,  joint venturesdivestitures and refranchisings.  Potential issues associated 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
with these activities could include,  among other things,  our ability to realize the full extent of the benefits or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of an acquisition,  divestiture or refranchising,  or the formation of a joint venture,  within the anticipated time frame,  or at all; receipt of necessary consents,  clearances and approvals in connection with an acquisition,  joint venture,  divestiture  or refranchising; and diversion of management is attention from base strategies and objectives.  With respect to acquisitionsthe following also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company,  including integrating the manufacturingdistribution,  sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between our Company and the acquired company and successfully operating in new categories; motivating,  recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming standards,  controls (including internal control over financial reporting),  procedures and policies,  business cultures and compensation structures between our Company and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of the acquisitions.  With respect to joint ventures,  we share ownership and management responsibility of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goalsstrategies,  priorities or resources as we do and joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-ownersrather than for our exclusive benefit.  In addition,  acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States,  including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws,  and laws and regulations outside the United States.  With respect to divestitures and refranchisings,  we may not be able to complete such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all.  In addition,  as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business,  any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact sales or business performance.  If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations,  or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  
If we are unable to hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce,  it could have a negative impact on our business.  Our continued growth requires us to hire,  retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce.  We compete to hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies.  Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions,  including our Chief Executive Officer,  or to hire and retain a diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.  In addition,  our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees,  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.  Trade consolidation or the loss of any key customer could adversely affect our financial performance.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,  including Wal-Mart,  as well as other retailersto effectively compete.  The loss of any of our key customersincluding Wal-Mart,  could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.  In addition,  our industry has been affected by increasing concentration of retail ownership,  particularly in the United States and Europe,  which may impact our ability to compete as such retailers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.  Further,  should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks and private label brands,  the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded.  Failure to appropriately respond to any such actions or to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space at our retailers and adversely affect our financial performance.  Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.  Our objective is to maintain credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global capital and credit markets.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency,  especially any downgrade to below investment grade,  could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to usor at all.  In addition,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,  and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also 2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade.  If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  successfully implement our ongoing business transformation initiative or outsource certain functions effectively,  our business could suffer.  We depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations,  to interface with our customers,  to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency,  to comply with regulatory financial reporting,  legal and tax requirements,  and for digital marketing activities and electronic communication among our locations around the world and between our personnel and the personnel of our independent bottlers,  contract manufacturers,  joint venturessuppliers or other third-party partners.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure,  we could be subject to transaction errors,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of customers,  business disruptions,  the loss of or damage to intellectual property,  or the loss of sensitive or confidential data through security breach or otherwise.  We have embarked on multi-year business transformation initiatives to migrate certain of our financial processing systems to enterprise-wide systems solutions.  There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits.  The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of the trade,  which could result in the loss of customers.  In addition,  the failure to either deliver the applications on time,  or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs,  could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue.  In addition,  we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions,  such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration,  to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.  If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform or do not perform effectively,  we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers.  Depending on the function involved,  such errors may also lead to business disruption,  processing inefficiencies,  the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach,  the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise,  litigation or remediation costs and could have a negative impact on employee morale.  
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential informationcorrupting information or disrupting business processes.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets,  litigation,  remediation costsdamage to our reputation and loss of revenue resulting from unauthorized use of confidential information or failure to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition.  We hold assets and incur liabilities,  earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.  dollars,  the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S.  dollars.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate a significant portion of our net revenue.  Fluctuations in exchange rates may therefore adversely impact our business results or financial condition.  See also 'Market Risks" and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  Climate change,  or legal,  regulatory or market measures to address climate change,  may negatively affect our business and operations.  There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures,  weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity,  we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products,  such as sugar cane,  corn,  wheat,  riceoats,  potatoes and various fruits.  We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change,  which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.  In addition,  natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain.  The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional,  federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases.  In the event that such regulation is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency,  we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery.  In particular,  increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energyincluding fuel,  required to operate our facilities or transport 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
and distribute our products,  thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products.  As a result,  climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.  See also 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activitiesincrease our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. ",  'Our operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs,  disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies. " and 'Disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our businessfinancial condition and results of operations. " A portion of our workforce belongs to unions.  Failure to successfully renew collective bargaining agreementsor strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer.  Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  These agreements expire on various dates.  Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms,  which could adversely impact our operating results.  The terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.  Our intellectual property rights could be infringed or challenged and reduce the value of our products and brands and have an adverse impact on our businessfinancial condition and results of operations.  We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business.  These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrights,  patents,  business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products,  their packagingthe processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses.  We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark,  copyright,  patent and trade secret lawsthird-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property.  If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our ingredient formulas,  trademarks,  copyrights,  patents,  business processes and other trade secrets,  or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property,  the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  See also 'Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities,  increase our operating costs,  reduce demand for our products or result in litigation. " 
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation or legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business,  including but not limited to litigation related to our marketing or commercial practices,  product labels and environmental and insurance matters.  Since litigation is inherently uncertainthere is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings,  or that management is assessment of the materiality of these mattersincluding the reserves taken in connection therewith,  will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings.  In the event that management is assessment of materiality on current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future,  there may be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements,  results of operations or cash flows.  See also 'Any damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations. " Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 	 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; 	 foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and 	 interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including productivity initiatives,  global purchasing programs and hedging strategies.  Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies.  Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price purchase orders and pricing agreements.  See Note  9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments.  Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly,  including a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this 2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.  See 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below.  See Note  10 to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.  See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.  Inflationary,  deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products.  Commodity Prices We expect to be able to reduce the impact of volatility in our raw material and energy costs through our hedging strategies and ongoing sourcing initiatives.  We use derivatives,  with terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for agricultural products,  metals and energy.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $507  million as of December  29,  2012 and $598  million as of December  312011.  At the end of 2012,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2012 by $49 million.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $853 million as of December 29,  2012 and $630 million as of December 312011.  At the end of 2012,  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments,  assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price,  would have increased our net losses in 2012 by $85 million.  Foreign Exchange Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.  dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within PepsiCo common shareholders' equity under the caption currency translation adjustment.  Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 49% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 25% of our net revenue.  As a 48 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  During 2012unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 25  percentage points,  primarily due to depreciation of the Russian ruble,  euro,  Brazilian real and the Mexican peso.  Currency declines against the U.S.  dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future results.  The results of our Venezuelan businesses have been reported under hyperinflationary accounting since the beginning of our  2010 fiscal year,  at which time the functional currency of our Venezuelan entities was changed from the bolivar fuerte (bolivar) to the U.S.  dollar.  As a result of the change to hyperinflationary accounting and the devaluation of the bolivar,  we recorded an after-tax net charge of $120 million in 2010.  In 2012 and 2011,  the majority of our transactions and net monetary assets qualified to be remeasured at the official exchange rate of obtaining U.S.  dollars for dividends through the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI) (43 bolivars per dollar for 2012 and 2011).  In 2012 and 2011,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 7% and 8% of our cash and cash equivalents balance,  respectivelyand generated 1% of our net revenue in 2012 and less than 1% of our net revenue in 2011.  Effective February 2013,  the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate to 63  bolivars per dollar.  We expect that the impact of the devaluation on PepsiCo is 2013 net revenue and operating profit will not be material.  The above impact excludes an after-tax net charge of approximately $100 million associated with the remeasurement of bolivar denominated net monetary assets.  This after-tax net charge will be reflected in items affecting comparability in our 2013 first quarter Form 10-Q.  We continue to use available options to obtain U.S.  dollars to meet our operational needs.  We are also exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.  We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers,  negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value  of $28  billion as of December  29,  2012 and $23  billion as of  December  31,  2011.  At the end of 2012,  we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses by $134 million.  For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  all losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swaps,  cross-currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness has been swapped to floating rates.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency swaps match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  The notional amounts of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 29,  2012 and December 312011 were $81 billion and $83 billion,  respectively.  Assuming year-end 2012 variable rate debt and investment levels,  a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by $9 million in 2012.  Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives necessarily involves taking risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritize,  address,  managemonitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes: 	 PepsiCo is Board of Directors,  which is responsible for overseeing the assessment and mitigation of the Company is top risks,  receives updates on key risks throughout the year.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors helps define PepsiCo is risk management processes and assists the Board in its oversight of strategic,  financial,  operatingbusiness,  compliance,  safety,  reputational and other risks facing PepsiCo.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in overseeing potential risks that may be associated with the Company is compensation programs; 	 The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC),  comprised of a crossfunctional,  geographically diverse,  senior management group which meets regularly to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address our key risks; 	 Division Risk Committees (DRC),  comprised of cross-­ functional senior management teams which meet regularly to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address division-specific business risks; 
	 PepsiCo is Risk Management Office,  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PRC and the DRCsidentifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties,  as well as with PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors; 	 PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and 	 PepsiCo is Compliance & Ethics Department,  which leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.  
Our Critical Accounting Policies An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results.  These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties,  and as a result,  such estimates may significantly impact our financial results.  The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.  Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans,  our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting.  We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects,  and for all periods presented,  and have discussed these policies with our Audit Committee.  Our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: 	 revenue recognition; 	 goodwill and other intangible assets; 	 income tax expense and accruals; and 	 pension and retiree medical plans.  
Revenue Recognition Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms.  Our credit terms,  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices,  typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the U.S.,  and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally,  and may allow discounts for early payment.  We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience 2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed.  In fact,  our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered.  In addition,  DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product.  For product delivered through our other distribution networks,  we monitor customer inventory levels.  As discussed in 'Our Customers, " we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives,  discounts,  advertising and other marketing activities.  Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $347  billion in 2012,  $346  billion in 2011 and $291 billion in 2010.  Sales incentives and discounts include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.  A number of our sales incentives,  such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates,  are based on annual targets,  and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout.  These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels.  Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.  The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year,  and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates.  Certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rights,  may extend beyond one year.  Payments made to obtain these rights are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $335  million as of December  29,  2012 and $313 million as of December 31,  2011 are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For interim reporting,  our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs.  The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period is actual gross revenue and volume,  as applicable,  to our forecasted annual gross revenue and volume,  as applicable.  Based on our review of 50 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
the forecasts at each interim period,  any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized in the interim period as they are identified.  In addition,  we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for advertising and other marketing activities.  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our total marketplace spending.  Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.  We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibilitythe aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data.  Bad debt expense is classified within selling,  general and administrative expenses in our income statement.  
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names,  many of which were developed by us.  The brand development costs are expensed as incurred.  We also purchase brands in acquisitions.  In a business combination,  the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities,  including brandsbased on estimated fair values,  with any excess recorded as goodwill.  Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  such as marketplace participants,  product life cyclesmarket share,  consumer awareness,  brand history and future expansion expectations,  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance,  and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future.  If these perpetual brand criteria are not met,  brands are amortized over their expected useful lives,  which generally range from five to 40  years.  Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors,  including market share,  consumer awareness,  brand history,  future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions,  as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.  Perpetual brands and goodwill are not amortized and are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment test at the reporting unit level.  A reporting unit can be a division or business within a division.  The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit,  including goodwill,  with its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows.  Discounted cash flows are primarily based on growth rates for sales and operating profit 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
which are inputs from our annual long-range planning process.  Additionally,  they are also impacted by estimates of discount rates,  perpetuity growth assumptions and other factors.  If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record,  if any.  In the second step,  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit is goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Amortizable brands are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value,  which is based on its discounted future cash flows.  In connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided PBG and PAS with the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.  In determining the useful life of these reacquired franchise rights,  we considered many factors,  including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements,  the indefinite period expected for the reacquired rights to contribute to our future cash flows,  as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of the reacquired rights to us,  including legalregulatory,  contractual,  competitive,  economic or other factors.  Therefore,  certain reacquired franchise rights,  as well as perpetual brands and goodwill,  are not amortized,  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually.  Certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.  Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows.  Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations,  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital,  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans.  These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in 'Our Business Risks. " We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented.  In addition,  as of December  292012,  we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.  We recognized impairment charges in Europe for other nonamortizable intangible assets of $23 million and $14 million in 2012 and 2011,  respectively.  We did not recognize any impairment charges for other nonamortizable intangible assets in 2010.  
As of December  29,  2012,  we had $317  billion of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets,  primarily related to the acquisitions of PBG,  PAS and WBD.  
Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income,  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  We establish reserves when,  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable,  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not succeed.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstancessuch as the progress of a tax audit.  An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating resultsthe tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item.  We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items.  Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements.  As a result,  our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate).  Some of these differences are permanent,  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,  and some differences reverse over time,  such as depreciation expense.  These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets ifbased on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred,  or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements.  In 2012,  our annual tax rate was 252% compared to 268% in 2011,  as discussed in 'Other Consolidated Results. " The tax rate in 2012 decreased 16  percentage points primarily reflecting the tax impact of a favorable tax court decision combined with the pre-payment of Medicare subsidy liabilitiespartially offset by the tax impact of the transaction with Tingyi and the lapping of prior year tax benefits related to a portion of our international bottling operations.

Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  Certain U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost.  As of February 2012,  certain U.S.  employees earning a benefit under one of our defined benefit pension plans were no longer eligible for Company matching contributions on their 401(k) contributions.  In the fourth quarter of 2012,  the Company offered certain former employees who have vested benefits in our defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant is pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA) ).  See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  For information about certain changes to our U.S.  pension and retiree medical plans and changes in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working,  as well as the present value of those benefits.  Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost),  (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost)and (3) other gains and losses as discussed below,  reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.  Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expense include: 	 the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate); 	 certain employee-related factors,  such as turnover,  retirement age and mortality; 	 the expected return on assets in our funded plans; 	 for pension expense,  the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and 	 for retiree medical expense,  health care cost trend rates.  
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management is best judgment regarding future expectations.  Due to the significant management judgment involved,  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical benefit expenses and obligations.  At each measurement date,  the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality,  long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities.  In 2011 and 2010,  our U.S.  discount rate was determined using the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (Mercer Curve).  The Mercer Curve in 2011 and 2010 used a portfolio of high-­ quality bonds rated Aa or higher by Moody is.  In 2012,  due to the downgrade of several global financial institutions by Moody is,  Mercer developed a new curve,  the Above Mean Curve,  which we used to determine the discount rate for our U.S.  pension and retiree medical plans.  These curves included bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class,  taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.  Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilitiesan evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%.  Our target investment allocations are as follows: 2013 
Fixed income 
U.S.  equity 
International equity 
Real estate 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value.  For all other asset categories,  we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.  The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets is added to,  or subtracted from,  other gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions and from changes in our assumptions determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants,  which is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.  The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.  The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plan is liability and expense is reviewed annually.  Our review is based on our claim experience,  information provided by our health plans and actuaries,  and our knowledge of the health care industry.  Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics,  plan design,  new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.  Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2013 
Pension Expense discount rate 
Expected rate of return on plan assets 
Expected rate of salary increases 
Retiree medical Expense discount rate 
Expected rate of return on plan assets 
Current health care cost trend rate 
Based on our assumptions,  we expect our pension and retiree medical expenses to increase in 2013 primarily driven by lower discount rates,  partially offset by the impact of the 2012 lump sum payments offered to certain former employees.  Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in the discount rate or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase pension expense.  A 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would increase the 2013 pension expense as follows: Assumption 
Amount 
Discount rate 
Expected rate of return 
See Note  7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the sensitivity of our retiree medical cost assumptions.  Funding We make contributions to pension trusts maintained to provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.  These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits.  Generally,  we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible.  As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements,  we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-yougo basis,  although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.  Our pension contributions for 2012 were $1614 million,  of which $1375  million was discretionary.  Discretionary 2012 contributions included $405 million pertaining to pension lump sum payments.  Our retiree medical contributions for 2012 were $251 million,  of which $140 million was discretionary.  In 2013,  we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $240  million,  with up to approximately $17 million expected to be discretionary.  Our contributions for retiree medical benefits are estimated to be approximately $70  million in 2013.  Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors,  such as changes in interest rates,  deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws.  For estimated future benefit payments,  including our pay-as-you-go payments,  as well as those from trusts,  see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  metals and energy.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2012,  we recognized $65 million ($41 million after-tax or $003 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2011,  we recognized $102 million ($71 million after-tax or $004 per share) of mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2010,  we recognized $91 million ($58 million after-tax or $004 per share) of mark-to-market net gains on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses.  Merger and Integration Charges In 2012,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $16 million ($12 million after-tax or $001 per share) related to our acquisition of WBD,  including $11 million recorded in the Europe segment and $5 million recorded in interest expense.  In 2011,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $329 million ($271 million after-tax or $017 per share) related to our acquisitions of PBG,  PAS and WBD,  including $112 million recorded in the PAB segment,  $123  million recorded in the Europe segment,  $78 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense.  These charges also include closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD.  In 2010,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $799  million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  as well as advisory fees in connection with our acquisition of WBD.  $467  million of these charges were recorded in the PAB segment,  $111 million recorded in the Europe segment$191 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $30  million recorded in interest expense.  The merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS were incurred to help create a more fully integrated supply chain and go-to-market business model,  to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the distribution of our brands and to enhance our revenue growth.  These charges also include closing costs,  one-time financing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  In addition,  we recorded $9 million of merger-related charges,  representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS,  in bottling

equity income.  In total,  the above charges had an after-tax impact of $648 million or $040 per share.  Restructuring and Impairment Charges In 2012,  we incurred restructuring charges of $279  million ($215 million after-tax or $014 per share) in conjunction with our multi-year productivity plan (Productivity Plan),  including $38  million recorded in the FLNA segment,  $9  million recorded in the QFNA segment,  $50 million recorded in the LAF segment,  $102  million recorded in the PAB segment$42  million recorded in the Europe segment,  $28  million recorded in the AMEA segment and $10  million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.  In 2011,  we incurred restructuring charges of $383  million ($286 million after-tax or $018 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity Plan,  including $76 million recorded in the FLNA segment,  $18  million recorded in the QFNA segment,  $48 million recorded in the LAF segment,  $81 million recorded in the PAB segment,  $77  million recorded in the Europe segment,  $9  million recorded in the AMEA segment and $74 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.  The Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food,  snack and beverage businesses by leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo is operations,  goto-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing,  warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures,  with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.  The Productivity Plan is expected to enhance PepsiCo is cost-competitiveness,  provide a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives,  and serve as a financial cushion for potential macroeconomic uncertainty.  As a result,  we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $910 million,  $279 million of which was reflected in our 2012 results,  $383 million of which was reflected in our 2011 results,  and the balance of which will be reflected in our 2013 through 2015 results.  These charges will consist of approximately $540 million of severance and other employee-related costs; approximately $270 million for other costs,  including consulting-related costs and the termination of leases and other contracts; and approximately $100  million for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions.  These charges resulted in cash expenditures of $343 million in 2012 and $30 million in 2011with the balance of approximately $362  million expected in 2013 through 2015.  See Note  3 to our consolidated financial statements.  
Restructuring and Other Charges Related to the Transaction with Tingyi In 2012,  we recorded restructuring and other charges of $150 million ($176 million after-tax or $011 per share) in the AMEA segment related to the transaction with Tingyi.  See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.  Pension Lump Sum Settlement Charge In 2012,  we recorded a pension lump sum settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $195 million ($131 million after-tax or $008 per share).  See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  Tax Benefit Related to Tax Court Decision In 2012,  we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $217 million ($014 per share) associated with a favorable tax court decision related to the classification of financial instruments.  See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.  53rd Week In 2011,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each Decemberresulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  The 53rd week increased 2011 net revenue by $623 million and operating profit by $109 million ($64 million after-tax or $004 per share).  Inventory Fair Value Adjustments In 2011,  we recorded $46  million ($28  million after-tax or $002 per share) of incremental costs in cost of sales related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in WBD is balance sheet at the acquisition date and hedging contracts included in PBG is and PAS is balance sheets at the acquisition date.  In 2010,  we recorded $398 million ($333 million after-tax or $021 per share) of incremental costs related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory and other related hedging contracts included in PBG is and PAS is balance sheets at the acquisition date.  Substantially all of these costs were recorded in cost of sales.  Gain on Previously Held Equity Interests In 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PASwe recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 million ($060 per share),  comprising $735 million which was non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.

Venezuela Currency Devaluation As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  we recorded a $120 million net charge related to our change to hyperinflationary accounting for our Venezuelan businesses and the related devaluation of the bolivar.  $129  million of this net charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenseswith the balance (income of $9 million) recorded in our PAB segment.  In total,  this net charge had an after-tax impact of $120 million or $007 per share.  Asset Write-Off In 2010,  we recorded a $145 million charge ($92 million aftertax or $006 per share) related to a change in scope of one release in our ongoing migration to SAP software.  This change was driven,  in part,  by a review of our North America systems strategy following our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  Foundation Contribution In 2010,  we made a $100  million ($64  million after-tax or $004 per share) contribution to the PepsiCo Foundation,  Inc, in order to fund charitable and social programs over the next several years.  This contribution was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses.  Debt Repurchase In 2010,  we paid $672 million in a cash tender offer to repurchase $500 million (aggregate principal amount) of our 790% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2018.  As a result of this debt repurchase,  we recorded a $178 million charge to interest expense ($114 million after-tax or $007 per share),  primarily representing the premium paid in the tender offer.  Non-GAAP Measures Certain measures contained in this Annual Report are financial measures that are adjusted for items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability" for a detailed list and description of each of these items),  as well as,  in certain instances,  adjusted for foreign exchange.  These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).  Items adjusted for currency assume foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period.  In order to 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
compute our constant currency results,  we multiply or divideas appropriate,  our current year U.S.  dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,  as appropriate,  those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our ongoing performance and with how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP reporting measures.  See also 'Organic Revenue Growth" and 'Management Operating Cash Flow. "

Our divisions' physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S.  Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products.  In 2012,  total servings increased 3% compared to 2011.  Excluding the impact of the 53rd week,  total servings also increased 3% compared to 2011.  In 2011,  total servings increased 6% compared to 2010.  Excluding the impact of the 53rd week,  total servings increased 5% compared to 2010.  2012 and 2011 servings growth reflects an adjustment to the base year for divestitures that occurred in 2012 and 2011as applicable.

2012 On a reported basis,  total operating profit decreased 5% and operating margin decreased 06 percentage points.  Operating profit performance was primarily driven by cost increases reflecting strategic investments,  higher commodity costshigher advertising and marketing expense and unfavorable foreign exchange,  partially offset by effective net pricing.  Other corporate unallocated expenses increased 21%,  primarily driven by increased pension expense.  Commodity inflation was approximately $12 billion compared to the prior periodprimarily attributable to PAB,  FLNA and Europe.  Operating profit also benefited from actions associated with our productivity initiatives,  which contributed more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories among

2012 Net interest expense increased $9 million,  primarily reflecting higher average debt balances and higher rates on our debt balances,  partially offset by gains in the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs and the impact of the 53rd week in the prior year.  The tax rate decreased 16  percentage points compared to 2011,  primarily reflecting the tax impact of a favorable tax court decision combined with the pre-payment of Medicare subsidy liabilities,  partially offset by the tax impact of the transaction with Tingyi and the lapping of prior year tax benefits related to a portion of our international bottling operations.

Prior to 58 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
our acquisitions of PBG and PAS on February  26,  2010,  we had noncontrolling interests in each of these bottlers and consequently included our share of their net income in bottling equity income.  Upon consummation of the acquisitions in the first quarter of 2010,  we began to consolidate the results of these bottlers and recorded this gain in bottling equity income associated with revaluing our previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS to fair value.  Net interest expense decreased $36  million,  primarily reflecting interest expense in the prior year in connection with our cash tender offer to repurchase debt in 2010,  partially offset by higher average debt balances in 2011.  The tax rate increased 38 percentage points compared to 2010,  primarily reflecting the prior year non-taxable gain and reversal of deferred taxes attributable to our previously held equity interests in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 2% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 3%.  Items affecting comparability (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") decreased net income attributable to PepsiCo by 3 percentage points and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share by 35 percentage points.

However,  it is not a measure provided by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  Therefore,  this measure is not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP net revenue growth.  In order to compute our organic revenue growth results,  we exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,  foreign exchange translation and the 53rd week from reported net revenue growth.

2012 Net revenue increased 2% and pound volume declined 1%.  Net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing,  partially offset by the volume decline.

expenses.  The impact of the 53rd week in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 2  percentage points.  Lower restructuring and impairment charges contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth.  
These gains were partially offset by a double-digit decline in trademark SunChips.  Net revenue growth also benefited from effective net pricing.  The 53rd week contributed 2 percentage points to both net revenue and volume growth.  Operating profit grew 7%,  primarily reflecting the net revenue growth.  Restructuring charges reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points and were offset by the 53rd week,  which contributed 2  percentage points to operating profit growth.  
2011 Net revenue increased 6% and pound volume grew 3%.  The volume growth primarily reflected double-digit growth in our Sabra joint venture and in variety packs,  as well as midsingle-digit growth in trademark Doritos,  Cheetos and Ruffles.

2012 Net revenue and volume declined 1%.  The net revenue decline reflects the lower volume,  partially offset by effective net pricing.  The volume decline primarily reflects a double-digit decline in Chewy granola bars and a low-single-digit decline in oatmeal,  partially offset by the introduction of Soft Baked Cookies in the second quarter.  The volume and net revenue declines reflect the impact of the 53rd week in 2011,  which contributed nearly 2  percentage points to both the net revenue and volume declines.  Operating profit declined 13%,  primarily reflecting higher commodity costs,  which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 9 percentage points,  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses and effective net pricing.  The net impact of acquisitions and divestituresincluding a partnership investment in 2012 and the gain on the divestiture of a business in the prior year,  reduced operating profit performance by 5  percentage points.  Additionallythe benefit from a change in accounting methodology for inventory and the sale of a distribution center,  both of which were recorded in the prior year,  each contributed 2 percentage points to the operating profit decline.  The net impact of 
items affecting comparability in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1 percentage point.  2011 Net revenue was flat and volume declined 5%.  The impact of positive net pricing,  driven primarily by price increases taken in the fourth quarter of 2010,  was partially offset by negative mix.  The volume decline primarily reflects double-digit volume declines in ready-to-eat cereals and Chewy granola bars,  as well as a mid-single-digit decline in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix.  Favorable foreign exchange contributed nearly 1 percentage point to the net revenue performance.  The 53rd week positively contributed almost 2 percentage points to both the net revenue and volume performance.  Operating profit grew 8%,  primarily reflecting the favorable effective net pricing,  partially offset by the volume declines.  Gains on the divestiture of a business and the sale of a distribution center increased operating profit growth by 4 percentage points,  and a change in accounting methodology for inventory contributed 2  percentage points to operating profit growth (see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements).

2012 Net revenue increased 9%,  primarily reflecting effective net pricing and volume growth.  Acquisitions and divestitures in Argentina and Brazil in the prior year contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 7 percentage points.  Volume increased 13%,  primarily reflecting a mid-singledigit increase in Mexico and a slight increase in Brazil (excluding the impact of an acquisition).  Acquisitions contributed 9 percentage points to the volume growth.  Operating profit decreased 2%,  driven by higher commodity costs,  which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 17 percentage points,  as well as other cost increases reflecting strategic investments.  These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories.  The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced operating profit growth by 35  percentage points,  primarily as a result of a gain in the prior year associated with the sale of a fish business in Brazil.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 55 percentage points.

2012 Net revenue decreased 45%,  primarily reflecting the divestiture of our Mexico beverage business in the fourth quarter of 2011,  which contributed 5  percentage points to the net revenue decline.  Additionally,  volume declines were offset by favorable effective net pricing.  The impact of the 53rd week in the prior year contributed over 1 percentage point to the net revenue decline.  Volume decreased 2%,  driven by a 4% decline in North America volume,  partially offset by a 2% increase in Latin America volume.  North America volume declines were driven by a 4% decline in CSDs and a 3% decline in non-carbonated beverage volumes.  The non-carbonated beverage volume decline primarily reflected a double-digit decline in Tropicana brands and a low-single-digit decline in Gatorade sports drinks.  Latin America volume growth primarily reflected mid-single-digit increases in Mexico and Brazil,  partially offset by a high-singledigit decline in Venezuela.  The impact of the 53rd week in the prior year contributed 1 percentage point to the volume decline.  Reported operating profit decreased 10%,  primarily reflecting higher commodity costs,  which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 12 percentage points,  the volume decline and higher advertising and marketing expensespartially offset by effective net pricing and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories.  Excluding the items affecting comparability in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability") operating profit declined 12%.

Organizacion Cultiba SAB de CV (Cultiba),  formerly Geupecand Empresas Polar.  Unfavorable foreign exchange contributed 1 percentage point to the operating profit decline.  2011 Net revenue increased 10%,  primarily reflecting the incremental finished goods revenue related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  Favorable foreign exchange contributed nearly 1 percentage point to net revenue growth and the 53rd week contributed over 1 percentage point to net revenue growth.  Volume increased 2%,  primarily reflecting a 3% increase in Latin America volume,  as well as volume from incremental brands related to our DPSG manufacturing and distribution agreement,  which contributed 1 percentage point to volume growth.  North America volume,  excluding the impact of the incremental DPSG volume,  increased slightly,  as a 4% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume was partially offset by a 2% decline in CSD volume.  The non-carbonated beverage volume growth primarily reflected a double-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks.  The 53rd week contributed 1 percentage point to volume growth.  Reported operating profit increased 18%,  primarily reflecting the items affecting comparability in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability").  Excluding these items,  operating profit decreased 4%,  mainly driven by higher commodity costs and higher selling and distribution costs,  partially offset by the net revenue growth.  Operating profit performance also benefited from the impact of certain insurance adjustments and more-favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals in the current year,  which collectively contributed 2 percentage points to the reported operating profit growth.  2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT

2012 Net revenue decreased 1%,  primarily reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange,  which reduced net revenue growth by 7 percentage points,  partially offset by effective net pricing.  Our acquisition of WBD positively contributed 2 percentage points to the net revenue performance.  Snacks volume grew 3%,  mainly due to our acquisition of WBD,  which contributed 2  percentage points to volume growth and declined slightly for the comparable post-­ acquisition period.  Double-digit growth in Russia (ex-WBD) and mid-single-digit growth in South Africa were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Poland.  Additionally,  the United Kingdom was flat.  Beverage volume increased 1%,  primarily reflecting our acquisition of WBD,  which contributed over 1 percentage point to volume growth and increased at a low-single-digit rate for the comparable post-acquisition period.  Volume growth also reflected mid-single-digit growth in Turkey and low-­singledigit growth in Russia (ex-WBD) and the United Kingdom.  These increases were partially offset by a high-single-digit decline in Poland and a low-single-digit decline in Germany.  Operating profit increased 10%,  primarily reflecting the items affecting comparability in the above table (see 'Items Affecting Comparability").  Excluding these items affecting comparability,  operating profit declined 3%,  driven by higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchangewhich reduced operating profit performance by 17 percentage points and 6 points,  respectively,  as well as other cost increases reflecting certain strategic investments.  These 64

2012 Net revenue declined 10%,  reflecting the impact of the transaction with Tingyi and the deconsolidation of International Dairy and Juice Limited (IDJ),  which reduced net revenue performance by 15 percentage points and 2 percentage pointsrespectively,  partially offset by volume growth and effective net pricing.  Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted net revenue performance by nearly 3 percentage points.  Snacks volume grew 14%,  reflecting broad-based increaseswhich included double-digit growth in the Middle East,  India and China.  Additionally,  Australia experienced low-singledigit growth.  Beverage volume grew 10%,  driven by double-digit growth in India and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in the Middle East as well as in China,  which included the benefit of new co-branded juice products distributed through our joint venture with Tingyi.  The Tingyi co-branded volume had a 4-­p ercentage-point impact on AMEA is reported beverage volume.  Excluding the benefit of the Tingyi co-branded volume,  beverage volume in China declined high-single digits due to Tingyi is transitional impact on AMEA is legacy juice business,  the introduction of a 500ml PET value package in the third quarter of 2011,  which largely replaced our 600ml offering in the market,  and the timing of the New Year is holiday.

Excluding these items affecting comparability,  operating profit increased 3%,  reflecting the volume growth and effective net pricing,  partially offset by higher commodity costs,  which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points.  Excluding the restructuring and other charges related to the transaction with 
Tingyi listed in the above items affecting comparability,  the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced reported operating profit by 2 percentage points,  primarily as a result of a one-time gain in the prior year associated with the sale of our investment in our franchise bottler in Thailand,  which negatively impacted reported operating profit performance by 13 percentage points.  This decline was partially offset by the impact of structural changes related to the transaction with Tingyi,  which positively contributed 11 percentage points to reported operating profit performance.  Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced reported operating profit performance by 1 percentage point.  2011 Net revenue grew 17%,  reflecting volume growth and favorable effective net pricing.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition,  together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing (including long-term debt financing which,  depending upon market conditions,  we may use to replace a portion of our commercial paper borrowings),  will be adequate to meet our operating,  investing and financing needs.  Sources of cash available to us to fund cash outflows,  such as our anticipated share repurchases and dividend payments,  include cash from operations and proceeds obtained in the U.S.  debt markets.  However,  there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities.  See also 'Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business results or financial condition. " in 'Our Business Risks. " As of December  29,  2012,  we had cash,  cash equivalents and short-term investments of $53  billion outside the U.S.  To the extent foreign earnings are repatriated,  such amounts would be subject to income tax liabilities,  both in the U.S.  and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions.  In addition,  currency restrictions enacted by the government in Venezuela have impacted our ability to pay dividends outside of the country from our snack and beverage operations in Venezuela.  As of December  29,  2012,  our operations in Venezuela comprised 7% of our cash and cash equivalents balance.  Effective February 2013,  the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate to 63 bolivars per dollar.  For additional information on the impact of the devaluation,  see 'Market Risks — Foreign Exchange" in 'Our Business Risks. " Furthermore,  our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality.  Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales,  which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns,  and generally lowest in the first quarter.  On a continuing basis,  we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results,  including acquisitions,  divestitures,  joint ventures,  share repurchases and other structural changes.  These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.  The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2012 
Net cash provided by operating activities 
Net cash used for investing activities 
Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Operating Activities During 2012,  net cash provided by operating activities was $85 billion,  compared to net cash provided of $89 billion in the prior year.  The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions of $15  billion ($11  billion after-tax) in 2012,  partially offset by favorable working capital comparisons to 2011.  During 2011,  net cash provided by operating activities was $89 billion,  compared to net cash provided of $84 billion in the prior year.  The increase over 2010 primarily reflects the overlap of discretionary pension contributions of $13 billion ($10 billion after-tax) in 2010,  partially offset by unfavorable working capital comparisons to the prior year.  Also see 'Management Operating Cash Flow" below for certain other items impacting net cash provided by operating activities.  Investing Activities During 2012,  net cash used for investing activities was $30 billion,  primarily reflecting $26  billion for net capital spending and $03 billion of cash payments related to the transaction with Tingyi.  During 2011,  net cash used for investing activities was $56  billion,  primarily reflecting $33  billion for net capital spending and $24 billion of cash paid,  net of cash and cash equivalents acquired,  in connection with our acquisition of WBD.  We expect 2013 net capital spending to be approximately $30 billion,  within our long-term capital spending target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.  Financing Activities During 2012,  net cash used for financing activities was $33 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $65  billion as well as net repayments of  short-term borrowings of $15  billion,  partially offset by net  proceeds from long-term debt of $36  billion and stock option proceeds of $11 billion.  During 2011,  net cash used for financing activities was $51 billion,  primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments of $56 billion,  our purchase of an additional $14 billion of WBD ordinary shares (including shares under­ lying American Depositary Shares (ADS) ) and our repurchase of certain WBD debt obligations of $08 billion,  partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $14 billion and stock option proceeds of $09 billion.  We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors,  including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity.  In the first quarter of 2013,  we approved a new 
Management is Discussion and Analysis 
share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10  billion of PepsiCo common stock from July  1,  2013 through June 30,  2016,  which will succeed the current repurchase program that expires on June 30,  2013.  In addition,  we announced a 56% increase in our annualized dividend to $227 per share from $215 per share,  effective with the dividend payable in June 2013.  Under these programs,  we expect to return a total of $64 billion to shareholders in 2013 through dividends of approximately $34 billion and share repurchases of approximately $30 billion.  Management Operating Cash Flow We focus on management operating cash flow as a key element in achieving maximum shareholder value.  Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities,  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash.  As such,  we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.  Additionally,  we consider certain items (included in the table below) in evaluating management operating cash flow.  We believe investors should consider these items in evaluating our management operating cash flow results.  Management operating cash flow excluding certain items is the primary measure we use to monitor cash flow performance.  However,  it is not a measure provided by U.S.  GAAP.  Therefore,  this measure is not,  and should not be viewed as,  a substitute for U.S.  GAAP cash flow measures.  The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities,  as reflected in our cash flow statement,  to our management operating cash flow excluding the impact of the items below.  2012 Net cash provided by operating activities

Management operating cash flow excluding above items 
In all years presented,  management operating cash flow was used primarily to repurchase shares and pay dividends.  We expect to continue to return management operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining credit ratings that provide us with ready access to global and capital credit markets.  However,  see 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Our Business Risks" for certain factors that may impact our operating cash flows.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency,  especially any downgrade to below investment gradecould increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us,  or at all.  In addition,  any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically,  and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  See 'Our Business Risks, " Note  9 to our consolidated financial statements and 'Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. " in 'Our Business Risks. " Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note  9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term contractual commitments.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 1 — ​Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and the affiliates that we control.  In additionwe include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest,  our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources.  We do not control these other affiliates,  as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally less than 50%.  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.  Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December,  resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years.  In 2011,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  On February  26,  2010,  we completed our acquisitions of PBG and PAS.  The results of the acquired companies in the U.S.  and Canada were reflected in our consolidated results as of the acquisition date,  and the international results of the acquired companies have been reported as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2010,  consistent with our monthly international reporting calendar.  The results of the acquired companies in the U.S.,  Canada and Mexico are reported within our PAB segment,  and the results of the acquired companies in Europe,  including Russia,  are reported within our Europe segment.  Prior to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we recorded our share of equity income or loss from the acquired companies in bottling equity income in our income statement.  Our share of income or loss from other noncontrolled affiliates is reflected as a component of selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Additionally,  in the first quarter of 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we recorded a gain on our previously held equity interests of $958 millioncomprising $735 million which was non-taxable and recorded in bottling equity income and $223 million related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with these previously held equity interests.  See Notes 8 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements,  and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results see 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  As of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year,  the results of our Venezuelan businesses are reported under hyperinflationary accounting.  See 'Our Business Risks" and 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
In the first quarter of 2011,  QFNA changed its method of accounting for certain U.S.  inventories from the last-in,  firstout (LIFO) method to the average cost method as we believe that the average cost method of accounting improves our financial reporting by better matching revenues and expenses and better reflecting the current value of inventory.  The impact of this change on consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2011 was approximately $9  million (or less than a penny per share).  Prior periods were not restated as the impact of the change on previously issued financial statements was not considered material.  Raw materials,  direct labor and plant overhead,  as well as purchasing and receiving costs,  costs directly related to production planning,  inspection costs and raw material handling facilities,  are included in cost of sales.  The costs of movingstoring and delivering finished product are included in sellinggeneral and administrative expenses.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Estimates are used in determining,  among other items,  sales incentives accruals,  tax reserves,  stock-based compensation,  pension and retiree medical accruals,  amounts and useful lives for intangible assets,  and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands,  goodwill and other long-lived assets.  We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience,  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances,  such as current economic conditions,  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change.  As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision,  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis,  most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis.  In 2011,  we had an additional week of results (53rd week).  The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for all other reporting periods presented: Quarter

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Tabular dollars are in millions,  except per share amounts.  All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts,  assume dilution unless noted,  and are based on unrounded amounts.  Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the 2012 presentation.  
Our Divisions We manufacture or use contract manufacturers,  market and sell a variety of salty,  convenient,  sweet and grain-based snacks,  carbonated and non-carbonated beverages,  dairy products and other foods in over 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in North America (United States and Canada),  Russia,  Mexico,  the United Kingdom and Brazil.  Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions.  For additional unaudited information on our divisions,  see 'Our Operations" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2,  except for the following allocation methodologies: 	 stock-based compensation expense; 	 pension and retiree medical expense; and 	 derivatives.  Stock-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for stock-based compensation expense and,  therefore,  this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.  The allocation of stock-based compensation expense in 2012 was approximately 16% to FLNA,  2% to QFNA,  5% to LAF,  25% to PAB,  14% to Europe,  12% to AMEA and 26% to corporate unallocated expenses.  We had similar allocations of stockbased compensation expense to our divisions in 2011 and 2010.  The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which 
reflect market conditions over which division management has no control.  Therefore,  any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at a fixed discount rate,  as well as amortization of costs related to certain pension plan amendments and gains and losses due to demographics,  including salary experience,  are reflected in division results for North American employees.  Division results also include interest costs,  measured at a fixed discount ratefor retiree medical plans.  Interest costs for the pension planspension asset returns and the impact of pension funding,  and gains and losses other than those due to demographics,  are all reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.  In addition,  corporate unallocated expenses include the difference between the service costs measured at a fixed discount rate (included in division results as noted above) and the total service costs determined using the plans' discount rates as disclosed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  metals and energy.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.  Therefore,  the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,  which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.  These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for speculative purposes.

Note 2 — ​Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery to our customers based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.  However,  our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Similarly,  our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products.  Based on our experience with this practice,  we have reserved for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.  For additional unaudited information on our revenue recognition and related policies,  including our policy on bad debts,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We are exposed to concentration of credit risk by our customers,  including Wal-Mart.  In 2012,  Wal-Mart (including Sam is) represented approximately 11% of our total net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers which are used in finished goods sold by them to Wal-Mart.  We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.  Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives,  discounts,  advertising and other marketing activities.  Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and totaled $347 billion in 2012,  $346 billion in 2011 and $291 billion in 2010.  Sales incentives and discounts include payments to customers for performing merchandising activities on our behalf,  such as payments for in-store displays,  payments to gain distribution of new products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices.  It also includes support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.  While most of these incentive arrangements have terms of no more than one year,  certain arrangements,  such as fountain pouring rightsmay extend beyond one year.  Costs incurred to obtain these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life,  as a reduction of revenue,  and the remaining balances of $335 million as of December 29,  2012 and $313  million as of December  31,  2011,  are included in current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.  For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  Advertising and other marketing activities,  reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses,  totaled $37 billion in 2012,  $35 billion in 2011 and $34 billion in 2010,  including 78 
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
advertising expenses of $22  billion in 2012 and $19  billion in both 2011 and 2010.  Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: 	 media and personal service prepayments; 	 promotional materials in inventory; and 	 production costs of future media advertising.  Deferred advertising costs of $88 million and $163 million at year-end 2012 and 2011,  respectively,  are classified as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet.  
Distribution Costs Distribution costs,  including the costs of shipping and handling activities,  are reported as selling,  general and administrative expenses.  Shipping and handling expenses were $91 billion in 2012,  $92 billion in 2011 and $77 billion in 2010.  Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended.  Capitalized software costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software(ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software.  Capitalized software costs are included in propertyplant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software,  which approximate 5 to 10 years.  Software amortization totaled $196 million in 2012,  $156 million in 2011 and $137 million in 2010.  Net capitalized software and development costs were $11 billion as of December 292012 and $13 billion as of December 31,  2011.  Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,  certain taxes and environmental matters,  as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.  We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.  For additional information on our commitments,  see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth in these activities and to drive innovation globally.  These activities principally involve the development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing products,  improvement and modernization of production processes,  and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines.  Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs.  Research and development costs were $552 million in 2012,  $525 million in 2011 and $488 million in 2010 and are reported within selling,  general and administrative expenses.  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012,  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  An entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment,  while no further analysis would be required if it passes.  The provisions of the new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year.  We do not expect the new guidance to have an impact on the 2013 impairment test results.  In September 2011,  the FASB issued new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors Other Significant Accounting Policies of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is fair Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed value is less than its carrying amount before applying the twoas follows: step goodwill impairment test.

2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
In June 2011,  the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability,  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income.  The new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.  The provisions of the guidance were effective as of the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year.  Accordingly,  we have presented the components of net income and other comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended December  29,  2012,  December  31,  2011 and December 25,  2010 as separate but consecutive statements.  In February 2013,  the FASB issued guidance that would require an entity to provide enhanced footnote disclosures to explain the effect of reclassification adjustments on other comprehensive income by component and provide tabular disclosure in the footnotes showing the effect of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the line items of net income.  The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year.  We do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.  In the second quarter of 2010,  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law.  The PPACA changes the tax treatment related to an existing retiree drug subsidy (RDS) available to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D.  As a result of the PPACA,  RDS payments will effectively become taxable in tax years beginning in 2013,  by requiring the amount of the subsidy received to be offset against our deduction for health care expenses.  The provisions of the PPACA required us to record the effect of this tax law change beginning in our second quarter of 2010,  and consequently we recorded a onetime related tax charge of $41 million in the second quarter of 2010.  In the first quarter of 2012,  we began pre-paying funds within our 401(h) voluntary employee beneficiary associations (VEBA) trust to fully cover prescription drug benefit liabilities for Medicare eligible retirees.  As a result,  the receipt of future Medicare subsidy payments for prescription drugs will not be taxable and consequently we recorded a $55 million tax benefit reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2012.  
Note 3 — ​Restructuring,  Impairment and Integration Charges In 2012,  we incurred restructuring charges of $279  million ($215  million after-tax or $014 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity Plan.  In 2011,  we incurred restructuring charges of $383  million ($286  million after-tax or $018 per share) in conjunction with our Productivity Plan.  All of these charges were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance and other employee related costs,  asset impairments,  and consulting and contract termination costs.  The Productivity Plan includes actions in every aspect of our business that we believe will strengthen our complementary food,  snack and beverage businesses by leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo is operations; go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing,  warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures,  with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management.  The Productivity Plan is expected to enhance PepsiCo is cost-competitiveness,  provide a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives,  and serve as a financial cushion for potential macroeconomic uncertainty.

In 2012,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $16 million ($12 million after-tax or $001 per share) related to our acquisition of WBD,  including $11  million recorded in the Europe segment and $5  million recorded in interest expense.  All of these net charges,  other than the interest expense portion,  were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The majority of cash payments related to these charges were paid by the end of 2012.  In 2011,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $329 million ($271 million after-tax or $017 per share) related to our acquisitions of PBG,  PAS and WBD,  including $112 million recorded in the PAB segment,  $123  million recorded in the Europe segment,  $78 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $16 million recorded in interest expense.  All of these net charges,  other than the interest expense portion,  were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  These charges also include closing costs and advisory fees related to our acquisition of WBD.  Substantially all cash payments related to the above charges were made by the end of 2011.  In 2010,  we incurred merger and integration charges of $799  million related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  as well as advisory fees in connection with our acquisition of WBD.  $467  million of these charges were recorded in the PAB segment,  $111 million recorded in the Europe segment$191 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses and $30 million recorded in interest expense.  All of these chargesother than the interest expense portion,  were recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of PBG and PAS were incurred to help create a more fully integrated supply chain and go-to-market business model,  to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the distribution of our brands and to

In addition,  we recorded $9 million of merger-related charges,  representing our share of the respective merger costs of PBG and PAS,  in bottling equity income.

2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment.  In these circumstances,  if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,  the asset is written down to its estimated fair valuewhich is based on discounted future cash flows.  Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.  For additional unaudited information on our policies for amortizable brands,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Nonamortizable Intangible Assets Perpetual brands and goodwill are assessed for impairment at least annually.  If the carrying amount of a perpetual brand exceeds its fair value,  as determined by its discounted cash flows,  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented.  We recorded impairment charges on certain brands in Europe of $23 million and $14 million in 2012 and 2011,  respectively.

For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies,  including our reserves for income taxes,  see 'Our Critical Accounting Policies" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  
Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,  for which we have established a reserve,  is audited and finally resolved.  The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: 	 U.S.  — ​during 2012,  we received a favorable tax court decision related to the classification of financial instruments.  We continue to dispute three matters related to the 2003– 2007 audit cycle with the IRS Appeals Division.  We are currently under audit for tax years 2008–2009; 	 Mexico — ​audits have been completed for all taxable years through 2005.  We are currently under audit for 2006–2008; 	 United Kingdom — ​audits have been completed for all taxable years through 2009; 	 Canada — ​domestic audits have been substantially completed for all taxable years through 2008.  International audits have been completed for all taxable years through 2005; and 	 Russia — ​audits have been substantially completed for all taxable years through 2008.  We are currently under audit for 2009–2011.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  We adjust these reserves,  as well as the related interest,  in light of changing facts and circumstances.  Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.  For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues,  see 'Other Consolidated Results" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  We believe that it is reasonably possible that our reserves for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $15  billion within the next twelve months as a result of the completion of audits in various jurisdictions,  including the potential settlement with the IRS for the taxable years 2003–2009.  As of December 29,  2012,  the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes,  reported in income taxes payable and other liabilities,  was $2425  million.  Any prospective adjustments to these reserves will be recorded as an increase or decrease to our provision for income taxes and would impact our effective tax rate.  In addition,  we accrue interest related to 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling,  general and administrative expenses.  The gross amount of interest accrued,  reported in other liabilities,  was $670  million as of December 29,  2012,  of which $10 million was recognized in 2012.  The gross amount of interest accrued,  reported in other liabilities,  was $660 million as of December 31,  2011,  of which $90 million was recognized in 2011.  A rollforward of our reserves for all federal,  state and foreign tax jurisdictions,  is as follows: 2012 Balance,  beginning of year

Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $104 billion at year-end 2012 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  These operating losses will expire as follows: $02  billion in 2013,  $82  billion between 2014 and 2032 and $20  billion may be carried forward indefinitely.  We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if,  based on the available evidence,  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Undistributed International Earnings As of December 29,  2012,  we had approximately $322 billion of undistributed international earnings.  We intend to continue to reinvest earnings outside the U.S.  for the foreseeable future and,  therefore,  have not recognized any U.S.  tax expense on these earnings.  
Note 6 — ​Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders.  Stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) are granted to employees under the shareholder-approved 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  
In 2012,  certain executive officers were granted PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPUnits).  These PEPUnits are earned based on achievement of a cumulative net income performance target and provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon absolute changes in PepsiCo is stock price as well as PepsiCo is Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a threeyear performance period.  The Company may use either authorized and unissued shares or repurchased common stock to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards.  At year-end 2012,  124  million shares were available for future stock-based compensation grants.  The following table summarizes our total stock-based compensation expense: 2012 Stock-based compensation expense

In connection with our acquisition of PBG in 2010,  we issued 134 million stock options and 27 million RSUs at weightedaverage grant prices of $4289 and $6230,  respectively,  to replace previously held PBG equity awards.  In connection with our acquisition of PAS in 2010,  we issued 04  million stock options at a weighted-average grant price of $3172 to replace previously held PAS equity awards.  Our equity issuances included 83 million stock options and 06 million RSUs which were vested at the acquisition date and were included in the purchase price.  The remaining 55 million stock options and 21 million RSUs issued were unvested at the issuance date and are being amortized over their remaining vesting periodup to three years from the issuance date.  As a result of our annual benefits review in 2010,  the Company approved certain changes to our benefits programs to remain market competitive relative to other leading global companies.  These changes included ending the Company is broad-based SharePower stock option program.  Consequently,  beginning in 2011,  no new awards were granted under the SharePower program.  Outstanding SharePower awards from 2010 and earlier continue to vest and are exercisable according to the terms and conditions of the program.  See Note 7 for additional information regarding other related changes.  
2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant.  In addition,  we use the Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model to determine the fair value of market-based awards.  The Monte-Carlo simulation option-pricing model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model,  howeverit also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.  Compensation costs related to awards with a market-based condition are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied,  provided that the requisite service has been provided.  All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.  We do not backdate,  reprice or grant stock-based compensation awards retroactively.  Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.  The fair value of stock option grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period,  generally three years.  Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award.  Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on 
their performance are generally offered the choice of stock options or RSUs.  Executives who elect RSUs receive one RSU for every four stock options that would have otherwise been granted.  Senior officers do not have a choice and,  through 2012,  are granted 50% stock options and 50% performancebased RSUs.  Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: Expected life 
 years 
 years 
 years 
Risk-free interest rate 
Expected volatility 
Expected dividend yield 
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.  It is based on our historical experience with similar grants.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S.  Treasury rate over the expected life.  Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.  Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income,  share repurchases and stock price.  A summary of our stock-based compensation activity for the year ended December 29,  2012 is presented below:

As of December 31,  2012,  there was $389 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested sharebased compensation grants.  This unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.  
Our pension plans cover certain full-time employees in the U.S.  and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  Certain U.S.  and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements.  Generally,  our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts,  which vary based upon years of service,  with retirees contributing the remainder of the costs.  Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions,  including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets,  and from changes in our assumptions are determined at each measurement date.  If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities,  a portion of the net gain or loss is included in expense for the following year based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participantswhich is approximately 11 years for pension expense and approximately 8 years for retiree medical expense.

prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit) ) is included in earnings on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.  In connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we assumed sponsorship of pension and retiree medical plans that provide benefits to certain U.S.  and international employees.  Subsequently,  during 2010,  we merged the pension plan assets of the legacy PBG and PAS U.S.  pension plans with those of PepsiCo into one master trust.  During 2010,  the Compensation Committee of PepsiCo is Board of Directors approved certain changes to the U.S.  pension and retiree medical plans,  effective January  1,  2011.  Pension plan design changes included implementing a new employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan for all future salaried new hires of the Company,  as salaried new hires are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan,  as well as implementing a new defined benefit pension formula for certain hourly new hires of the Company.  Pension plan design changes also included implementing a new employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan for certain legacy PBG and PAS salaried employees (as such employees are also not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan),  as well as implementing a new defined 
benefit pension formula for certain legacy PBG and PAS hourly employees.  The retiree medical plan design change included phasing out Company subsidies of retiree medical benefits.  As a result of these changes,  we remeasured our pension and retiree medical expenses and liabilities in 2010,  which resulted in a one-time pre-tax curtailment gain of $62 million included in retiree medical expenses.  In the fourth quarter of 2012,  the Company offered certain former employees who have vested benefits in our defined benefit pension plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant is pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or IRA).  In December 2012,  we made a discretionary contribution of $405  million to fund substantially all of these payments.  The Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash settlement charge of $195  million ($131  million after-tax or $008 per share) as a result of this transaction.  See 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.  The provisions of both the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act are reflected in our retiree medical expenses and liabilities and were not material to our financial statements.

Plan Assets Pension Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed securities and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities,  an evaluation of market conditions,  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments.  Our investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due.  Our overall investment strategy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations.  Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments which are primarily used to reduce risk.  Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S.  plan assets is 78%.  Our target investment allocations are as follows: 2013 
Fixed income 
U.S.  equity 
International equity 
Real estate 
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.  We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments to our target allocations.  The expected return on pension plan assets is based on our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class,  taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience.  We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term 
rates.  We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable.  To calculate the expected return on pension plan assets,  our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value.  For all other asset categories,  we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period.  This has the effect of reducing yearto-year volatility.  Our pension contributions for 2012 were $1614  millionof which $1375 million was discretionary.  Discretionary contributions included $405  million pertaining to pension lump sum payments.  Retiree Medical In 2012 and 2011,  we made non-discretionary contributions of $111  million and $110  million,  respectively,  to fund the payment of retiree medical claims.  In 2012,  we made a discretionary contribution of $140  million to fund future U.S.  retiree medical plan benefits.  This contribution was invested consistently with the allocation of existing assets in the U.S.  pension plan.  Fair Value The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair valueestablishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets.  Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value,  whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.

Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates An average increase of 7% in the cost of covered retiree medical benefits is assumed for 2013.  This average increase is then projected to decline gradually to 5% in 2020 and thereafter.  These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability.  However,  the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.  In addition,  as of January  1,  2011,  the Company started phasing out Company subsidies of retiree medical benefits.  A 1-­percentage-point change in the assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects: 1% Increase

Savings Plan Certain U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans,  which are voluntary defined contribution plans.  The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement,  and we make Company matching contributions on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  In 2010,  in connection with our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  we also made Company retirement contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service.  As of January  1,  2011,  a new employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan became effective for certain eligible legacy PBG and PAS salaried employees as well as all eligible salaried new hires of PepsiCo who were not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan as a result of plan design changes approved during 2010.  In 2012 and 2011,  our total Company contributions were $109 million and $144 million,  respectively.  As of February 2012,  certain U.S.  employees earning a benefit under one of our defined benefit pension plans were no longer eligible for the Company matching contributions on their 401(k) contributions.

Note 8 — ​Related Party Transactions On February 26,  2010,  we completed our acquisitions of PBG and PAS,  at which time we gained control over their operations and began to consolidate their results.  See Notes 1 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements.  Prior to these acquisitions,  our significant related party transactions were 
with PBG and PAS as they represented our most significant noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  In 2010,  prior to the date of acquisition of PBG and PAS,  we reflected the following related party transactions in our consolidated financial statements: net revenue of $993 million,  cost of sales of $116 million and selling,  general and administrative expenses of $6 million.  As a result of these acquisitions,  our related party transactions in 2011 and 2012 were not material.  We also coordinate,  on an aggregate basis,  the contract negotiations of sweeteners and other raw material requirements,  including aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for certain of our independent bottlers.  Once we have negotiated the contracts,  the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly.  Consequently,  these transactions are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.  As the contracting partywe could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our bottlers,  but we consider this exposure to be remote.  In addition,  our joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks sell finished goods (ready-todrink teas and coffees) to our noncontrolled bottling affiliates.  Consistent with accounting for equity method investmentsour joint venture revenue is not included in our consolidated net revenue.  In 2010,  we repurchased $357  million (55  million shares) of PepsiCo stock from the master trust which holds assets of PepsiCo is U.S.  qualified pension plans at market value.

Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing.  Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis.  Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments because they do not represent expected future cash outflows.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements,  other than in the normal course of business.

See 'Our Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our borrowings.  
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 10 — ​Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: 	 commodity prices,  affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; 	 foreign exchange risks and currency restrictions; and 	 interest rates.  In the normal course of business,  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies,  including the use of derivatives.  Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatmentwhile others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings.  Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity,  foreign exchange or interest risks are classified as operating activities.  We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.  See 'Our Business Risks" in Management is Discussion and Analysis for further unaudited information on our business risks.  For cash flow hedges,  changes in fair value are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in net income.  For fair value hedges,  changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings,  consistent with the underlying hedged item.  Hedging transactions are limited to an underlying exposure.  As a result,  any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items.  Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  If the derivative instrument is terminated,  we continue to defer the related gain or loss and then include it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item.  Upon determination that the underlying hedged item will not be part of an actual transaction,  we recognize the related gain or loss on the hedge in net income immediately.  We also use derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  We account for such derivatives at market value with the resulting gains and losses reflected in our income statement.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly,  including a review of credit ratings,  credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty.  Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk,  we consider this risk to be low.  In addition,  we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we 
believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.  
Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate.  This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price purchase orderspricing agreements and derivatives.  In addition,  risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.  We use derivativeswith terms of no more than three years,  to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases,  primarily for agricultural products,  metals and energy.  For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in corporate unallocated expenses.  Ineffectiveness was not material for all periods presented.  During the next 12 monthswe expect to reclassify net losses of $12  million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market each period and reflected in our income statement.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $507  million as of December 29,  2012 and $598 million as of December 31,  2011.  Our open commodity derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a face value of $853 million as of December 29,  2012 and $630 million as of December 31,  2011.  Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the U.S.  generate 49% of our net revenue,  with Russia,  Mexico,  Canada,  the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 25% of our net revenue.  As a result,  we are exposed to foreign currency risks.  Additionally,  we are also exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business.  We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers,  negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives,  primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years.  Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in our income statement as incurred.  Our foreign currency derivatives had a total face value of $28  billion as of December  29,  2012 and $23  billion as of December 31,  2011.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $14 million related to foreign currency contracts that qualify for hedge accounting from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  Additionally2012 PEPSICO ANNUAL REPORT 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
ineffectiveness for our foreign currency hedges was not material for all periods presented.  For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment,  all losses and gains were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items,  resulting in no net material impact on earnings.  
Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,  tax consequences and overall financing strategies.  We use various interest rate derivative instruments including,  but not limited to,  interest rate swaps,  cross-currency interest rate swaps,  Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk.  These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances.  Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness has been swapped to floating rates.  The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency swaps 
match the principal,  interest payment and maturity date of the related debt.  Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  The notional amounts of the interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December  29,  2012 and December 31,  2011 were $81 billion and $83 billion,  respectively.  For those interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting,  any ineffectiveness is recorded immediately.  Ineffectiveness was not material for all periods presented.  During the next 12 months,  we expect to reclassify net losses of $23 million related to these hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income.  As of December 29,  2012,  approximately 27% of total debtafter the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments,  was exposed to variable rates,  compared to 38% as of December 31,  2011.

Note 11 — ​Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect that would occur if in-the-money employee stock options were exercised and RSUs and preferred shares were converted into common shares.  Options to purchase 96 million shares in 2012,  259 million shares in 2011 and 244 million shares in 2010 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because these options were out-of-the-money.  Out-of-themoney options had average exercise prices of $6764 in 2012,  $6699 in 2011 and $6726 in 2010.

Note 15 — ​Acquisitions and Divestitures PBG and PAS On February  26,  2010,  we acquired PBG and PAS to create a more fully integrated supply chain and go-to-market business model,  improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the distribution of our brands and enhancing our revenue growth.  The total purchase price was approximately $126 billion,  which included $83 billion of cash and equity and the fair value of our previously held equity interests in PBG and PAS of $43  billion.  The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations,  and,  accordingly,  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.  Our fair market valuations of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were completed in the first quarter of 2011.  WBD On February 3,  2011,  we acquired the ordinary shares,  including shares underlying ADSs and Global Depositary Shares (GDS),  of WBD,  a company incorporated in the Russian Federation,  which represented in the aggregate approximately 66% of WBD is outstanding ordinary shares,  pursuant to the purchase agreement dated December 1,  2010 between PepsiCo and certain selling shareholders of WBD for approximately $38  billion in cash (or $24 billion,  net of cash and cash equivalents acquired).  The acquisition of those shares 
increased our total ownership to approximately 77%,  giving us a controlling interest in WBD.  Under the guidance on accounting for business combinations,  once a controlling interest is obtained,  we were required to recognize and measure 100% of the identifiable assets acquired,  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests at their full fair values.  Our fair market valuations of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were completed in the first quarter of 2012 and the final valuations did not materially differ from those fair values reported as of December 31,  2011.  On March 10,  2011,  we commenced tender offers in Russia and the U.S.  for all remaining outstanding ordinary shares and  ADSs of WBD for 388370 Russian rubles per ordinary share and 970925 Russian rubles per ADS,  respectively.  The Russian offer was made to all holders of ordinary shares and the U.S.  offer was made to all holders of ADSs.  We completed the Russian offer on May 19,  2011 and the U.S.  offer on May 16,  2011.  After completion of the offers,  we paid approximately $13 billion for WBD is ordinary shares (including shares underlying ADSs) and increased our total ownership of WBD to approximately 986%.  On June 30,  2011,  we elected to exercise our squeeze-out rights under Russian law with respect to all remaining WBD ordinary shares not already owned by us.  Therefore,  under Russian law,  all remaining WBD shareholders were required to sell their ordinary shares (including those underlying ADSs) to us at the same price that was offered to WBD shareholders in the Russian tender offer.  Accordingly,  all registered holders of ordinary shares on August  15,  2011 (including the ADSs depositary) received 388370 Russian rubles per ordinary share.  After completion of the squeeze-out in September 2011,  we paid approximately $79 million for WBD is ordinary shares (including shares underlying ADSs) and increased our total ownership to 100% of WBD.  
Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co.  Ltd.  On March 31,  2012,  we completed a transaction with Tingyi.  Under the terms of the agreement,  we contributed our company-owned and joint venture bottling operations in China to Tingyi is beverage subsidiary,  TAB,  and received as consideration a 5% indirect equity interest in TAB.  As a result of this transaction,  TAB is now our franchise bottler in China.  We also have a call option to increase our indirect holding in TAB to 20% by 2015.  We recorded restructuring and other charges of $150  million ($176  million after-tax or $011 per share)primarily consisting of employee-related charges,  in our 2012 results.  This charge is reflected in items affecting comparability.  See 'Items Affecting Comparability" in Management is Discussion and Analysis.

Management is Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and ­maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,  including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control — ​Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on that evaluation,  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29,  2012.  KPMG LLP,  an independent registered public accounting firm,  has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and,  as part of their audit,  has issued their report,  included herein,  on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012,  we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution.  These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative,  and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses over the course of the next few years.  Moreover,  we continue to integrate our WBD business,  which was acquired in 2011.  In connection with these implementations and integration,  and resulting business process changes,  we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain suitable controls over our financial reporting.  
Except as described above,  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 that have materially affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially affect,  our internal control over financial reporting.  February 21,  2013

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-­GAAP Information 
Core results,  core constant currency results and division operating profit are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below.

We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.  These commodity derivatives include agricultural products,  metals and energy.  Certain of these commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked to market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.  These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions take delivery of the underlying commodity.
