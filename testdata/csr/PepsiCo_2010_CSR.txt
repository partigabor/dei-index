PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Defining Performance with Purpose 
At PepsiCo,  we believe that what is good for society and what is good for business can and should be the same.  When we first launched Performance with Purpose,  we were clear that our long-term profitable growth was linked inextricably to our ability to deliver our sustainability objectives.  
We defined them as Performance — a promise to strive to deliver superior,  sustainable financial performance; Human Sustainability — addressing global and complex nutrition needs; Environmental Sustainability — being a good steward of our planet is natural resources; and Talent Sustainability — creating employment opportunities and developing associates while fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.  Today we are as committed to these objectives as ever.  As our business continues to grow and develop around the worldwe continue to evolve our thinking around Performance with Purpose.  Over the past two years,  as we have worked to embed our sustainability objectives firmly into our business model,  we have learned a great deal — about what we are capable of,  about the impact of our actions,  and about the priority areas that the business must focus on in order to continue to grow and serve the global community for the next decade.

CEO Letter 
Dear Fellow Stakeholders By any standard,  this is an inspiring paragraph to read in an annual report: 'To ensure a continuing climate in which it can prosper,  the modern company … must take an active role in civic,  cultural and community programs.  While results in this area are less tangible and harder to measure than sales or profits,  they are no less important. " The idea that ethics and growth are connected is a broadly shared understanding in today is business world.  But these words appeared in the PepsiCo Annual Report back in 1968 — just three years after the Pepsi-Cola Company and the Frito-Lay Company merged to form PepsiCo.  It is a testament to how long we have treasured the belief that corporate capabilities and corporate character are not just integrated,  but inseparable.  Back thenit led PepsiCo to become early corporate leaders on everything from civil rights to scholarships to recycling,  while growing our beloved brands in markets around the world.  Today,  PepsiCo is a $60 billion global food and beverage powerhouse offering consumers a wide range of choices.  Our global beverage business is large and highly profitable,  with brands that stand for quality and are respected household names — including Pepsi and Diet Pepsi,  Pepsi MaxMountain Dew,  Sierra Mist,  Gatorade,  Lipton Iced Tea and popular local brands such as Mirinda in Europe and Nimbooz in India.  Meanwhile,  our global snack business is driven by equally iconic and delicious brands,  such as Lay is,  Ruffles,  Doritos,  Fritos,  CheetosWalkers in the UK,  Fandangos in Brazil and Gamesa in Mexico.  And nested within our snack and beverage 
businesses is a nutrition business,  focused on fruitvegetables,  grains and dairy,  that is nearly. $13 billion and growing.  As the world is second-largest food and beverage business,  our ability to have a positive impact on the world is vast.  We believe that building a healthier future for people and our planet is good for PepsiCo is financial success and good for the world.  This is the cornerstone of our Performance with Purpose mission: that our long-term profitable growth (our Performance) is linked intrinsically to our ability to deliver on our social and environmental objectives (our Purpose).  From a business standpoint,  this is about both the short term and the long term,  today and tomorrow.  On the one hand,  Performance with Purpose has helped PepsiCo be competitive and profitable today: in 2010 alone,  our net revenue grew by 33 percent* and our core division operating profit rose 23 percent* — both on a constant currency basis — which enabled us to return $8 billion to our shareholders.  On the other hand,  Performance with Purpose keeps us ahead of the global challenges shaping our industry — which are articulated in the pages that follow— setting us up for market leadership and profitable growth into the next decade.  As this report demonstrates through four case studies,  Performance with Purpose is not a standalone initiative.  Instead,  our sustainability goalsacross the four planks — Performance,  HumanEnvironmental and Talent sustainability — are woven into the fabric of our brands,  guiding how they do business,  while generating significant sourcingoperational,  and consumer impacts that improve both our top and bottom lines.

We have made progress.  As you will see,  in some areaswe have made more progress than others — but we are moving in the right direction.  Based on what we have learned in this challenging process,  we are also determining how to best focus our effortsin order to have the greatest impact.  As with any complex initiative,  it is important to be flexible and responsive to a changing world.  As part of this learning process,  we are working to create better measurements to track our progress; invest in long-term research and development to expand our innovation; and build new partnerships to help achieve our Performance with Purpose goals.  The Promise of PepsiCo is not about altruism.  It is not about environmentalism.  It is,  instead,  about enlightened self interest: we believe these are the benchmarks that PepsiCo must meet to succeed in today is economy while ensuring,  as we said in 1968a continuing climate in which PepsiCo can prosper.  John Kennedy once said that 'the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities.  We need people who can dream of things that never were. " I look forward to working together,  building together and dreaming together in the days ahead to build an even bigger and better PepsiCo.

Improve our water-use Reduce our fuel-use efficiency by 20 percent per intensity by 25 percent per unit of production by 2015.  unit of production by 2015.  With five years left,  we have almost achieved our target,  improving our overall water-use efficiency by 183 percent for manufacturing operations through 2010.  These conservation efforts translate to a global water savings of nearly 138 billion liters compared with the 2006 baseline.  PepsiCo is goal to improve water-use efficiency by 20 percent per unit of production by 2015 against a 2006 baseline applies to global manufacturing operations in our network in 2006.  
We are well on our way to achieving this important energy-related goal.  Through 2010,  we have achieved an average combined reduction of 12 percent in per-unit use of thermal energy in our food and beverage plants.  A specific example of the kind of progress we have made can be found in our Casa Grande facilitya  net zero" plant that runs almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water.

Resource Risk 
World Challenges and Opportunities 
Key Challenge 1 
By 2050,  the world is population is expected to number nine billion.  This population growth presents complex challenges and trade-offs for both the health of people and the planet.  Even by 2030,  it is predicted that energy and food demand will be 45 percent and 50 percent higher,  respectively,  and two-thirds of the earth is population will live in water-stressed countries.  
As populations become wealthier,  their consumption patterns are likely to change with an increase in protein sourced from meat and dairy.  These require significant resources to produce,  and contribute to climate change and other environmental issues when not managed sustainably.  At the same time,  there are currently almost one billion people with insufficient food,  and billions more with micronutrient deficiencies.  These numbers will also increase by 2050.  It is clear that the health of the planet and the health of people are becoming increasingly intertwined.  Progress in achieving some of our environmental and health goals requires complex trade-offs to ensure that one set of goals doesn't advance at the cost of others.  
As a food and beverage company that both depends on food production for our raw materials and seeks to deliver nutritious,  delicious foods and beverages to our consumers,  we need to integrate and balance our goals in human and environmental sustainability in order to manage future resource risk.  Water stewardship is one area where that balance is critical for our business.  We are proud to be among the first companies to make a commitment to the Human Right to Water.  We are also working with partners such as Water, org,  Safe Water NetworkEarth Institute and Save the Children to bring this commitment to life by providing funding and onthe-ground support to make clean water available to more people.  And we are working with The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International to make sure the best water management practices are being used,  including water risk assessments,  water footprinting and watershed protection activities.  
We are sharing our knowledge about best sustainable agricultural practices to increase the supply of affordable crops and improve efficiency.  We are investing in,  applying and scaling new technology,  researching and testing hearty new varietals of crops used in our products,  such as potatoes and oats that can thrive in unforgiving climates,  and providing sustainability training and business support to farmers.  Corporations have a particular responsibility to utilize resources efficiently.  And large companies like PepsiCo must balance this responsibility with delivering profitable growth to shareholderswhile also considering the integrated impacts on nutrition,  the environment and agriculture in all business activities.

Global Health 
World Challenges and Opportunities 
Key Challenge 2 
Economic progress in the developing world has sparked a mass movement from rural areas to urban centers.  Half the world is population now lives in cities,  a figure that is expected to rise to 70 percent by 2050.  
As a consequence,  physical farm labor is being replaced by a more sedentary lifestyle that goes with urban living.  And the rise of urban living has increased the demand for affordable snacks and convenient foods.  One of the results of this transformation is a changing global health profile.  Fewer people are dying from infectious diseases,  and for the first time in human history,  noncommunicable diseases are responsible for more deaths than any other causes.  According to the World Health Organization,  diets high in salt,  fat and sugar,  combined with a lack of physical activity,  are key risk factors for a range of chronic diseases.  As a global leader in the food and beverage industry,  PepsiCo is taking aggressive steps to address these problems.  First and foremost,  we are broadening our range of products to offer consumers a wider variety of healthier choices that include more whole grainsfruits,  vegetables and dairy,  and less sodium,  added sugar and saturated fat.  We have taken a leadership 
position in making sure school vending machines provide healthier snacks and beverages,  along with maintaining higher standards on advertising by only promoting our healthier products such as Tropicana and Quaker Oats to children.  And we continue to work with partners around the world to educate consumers about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle as we work to create healthier food and beverage choices.  In Latin America,  we support Vive Saludable Escuelas,  a proven initiative that teaches children how to add physical activity to their daily lives.  Given our high-profile brands,  we also believe that we can play a critical role in promoting health through sharing our expertise and developing partnerships involving governments,  consumers and advocacy groups with an interest in these issues.  PepsiCo is currently involved in partnerships that span nutrition,  agriculture and science,  such as working with Scientists Without Borders on a challenge to address maternal and infant health.  
We have invested behind innovative agricultural partnerships to expand our ability to deliver healthier products in low- and middle-income countries.  PepsiCo is one of the first private-sector companies to participate in one of the Inter-American Development Bank is (IDB) regional trust funds for development activities.  The inaugural agriculture project of the partnership will expand commercial sunflower crop production in Mexico and create a sustainable market for sunflower production.  PepsiCo will also launch a small agriculture pilot in 2011 in Ethiopia to develop best practices in the cultivation of chickpea,  a nutritious,  protein-rich legume with environmental benefits as a nitrogen-fixing crop.  Improvements in cultivation,  storage and primary processing of chickpeas will likely benefit PepsiCo is commercial business in Sabra hummus (a joint venture with Strauss Food Group),  and Ethiopian farmer communities.  The project will also help The World Food Programme is development of a complementary feeding product to meet nutrition needs of undernourished children in Ethiopia and other countries.

Gender DiversityInclusion and Equality 
World Challenges and Opportunities 
Key Challenge 3 
Economies need educated and skilled workforces to ensure their economic health.  Since women account for one-half of the potential talent base,  it follows that a nation is growth depends on whether and how it educates and utilizes its female talent.  Economies in both developed and developing countries will never fully leverage their power to achieve sustainable growth until every woman has an equal right to learn,  earn and succeed.  
Equal opportunity for women and girls,  however,  is still a vision and not a reality.  More than 70 countries haven't even achieved gender parity in primary education.  The gap between women and men in economic participation also remains wide in the business community.  A review of Fortune 500 companies published in May 2011 by Catalyst found that only 144 percent of executive officers,  76 percent of top earners and 24 percent of CEOs are women.  In every society,  women is educational development and professional growth must be championed in a deliberate and purposeful way.  To encourage corporate leadership for gender equity,  PepsiCo is Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi has signed a CEO statement of support for the Women is Empowerment Principles — Equality Means Business.  The Principles 
offer guidance to companies on how to empower women in the workplace,  marketplace and community.  As the CEO statement recognizes,  'a broad concept of sustainability and corporate responsibility that embraces women is empowerment as a key goal will benefit us all. " PepsiCo Foundation grants focused on clean watersanitation,  food security and health are helping to create enabling environments in which women and girls in developing countries can advance.  For example,  95 percent of the beneficiaries of WaterCredit loans through Water, org are women.  PepsiCo is businesses,  along with our employeesare also helping women and girls to empower themselves.  Frito-Lay Turkey is 'Kizlarimiz Okuyor" project,  for example,  helps girls in economic 
need continue their high school education,  while PepsiCo Europe is partnership with the Trestle Group Foundation helps female entrepreneurs in emerging markets by providing them with a specially selected female PepsiCo executive as a mentor.  Within our company,  our commitment to diversity and inclusion encompasses the goal of achieving parity between women and men in our management and leadership ranks.  We have made progress.  Thirty-three percent of our Board members and 31 percent of our executives in the U.S.  are women.  While we are proud of the progress we have made,  we remain focused on supporting the advancement of women at PepsiCo to achieve even greater gains.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Case Story One Potato Chips 
PepsiCo is one of the leading purchasers of potatoes in the world,  and a dedicated global partner on sustainable agriculture and responsible sourcing.  
Find out how PepsiCo is sustainability strategy has affected the way we grow,  make and sell our savory snacks to benefit people and our planet.  
Case Stories 
PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Sourcing Impacts We rely on the earth is natural resources to create the potato chips that people enjoy around the world.  As we expand our agricultural footprint in developed and developing markets,  we are committed to minimizing the impact that our business has on the environment with practices that are socially responsible,  scientifically based and economically sound.  
Using less fertilizer yields more uniform chips and lowers carbon footprint.  
Working with partners to restore and increase water availability.  
Using savvy software to reduce farmers' emissions and save water and money.  
Our Global Sustainable Agriculture Policy is designed to encourage all of us to operate in a way that protects and nourishes land and communities.  Case in point: we are trialing the use of low-carbon fertilizers on potatoes,  which will not only reduce the company is carbon footprint,  but has the potential to produce potatoes that are more uniform in size and yield more chips per acre.  
For the second consecutive year,  PepsiCo is operations in India achieved positive water balance,  enabling us to give back to society more water than we used to manufacture our products.  To expand this achievement to other waterdistressed areas where we have a presence,  we began working with The Nature Conservancy,  with a focus on selected watersheds in China,  Mexico,  Europe,  India and the U.S.  We plan to pilot the development of a locally focused,  multifaceted assessment tool that will allow any of our global sites,  including our potato chip manufacturing facilities,  to identify its level of risk as well as watershed restoration strategies that are appropriate in that site is specific physical,  economic and community context.  
With 350 British farmers,  we launched an initiative in 2010 to cut carbon emissions and reduce the impact of applied water on U.K.  farms by 50 percent over five years.  We are exploring a host of innovations with our growersincluding i-crop 'precision farming" technology to reduce applied water and The Cool Farm Tool software for measuring carbon emissions.  
Breeding potatoes to reduce environmental impact.  PepsiCo has its own potato breeding program,  based in Rhinelander,  Wisconsin,  to develop new varieties of potatoes that have better disease resistance and storage lifetimes,  leading to improved yields and solids.  This can mean less land,  water,  pesticides,  fertilizer and/or fuel needed to grow the same amount of potatoes.  The betterlonger storage lifetimes also mean we have to ship fewer potatoes over fewer miles.  
Helping to build sustainability in emerging economies.  In 2010,  we announced numerous investments that will support emerging economies,  including $25 billion in China over the next three years (in addition to the company is $1 billion investment announced in 2008)and $250 million in Vietnam over the next three years.  PepsiCo is also investing $3 million in Peru to create the Agricultural Development Center of Peru,  the first of its kind for PepsiCo in Latin America,  which will focus on new varieties of potatoes and other tubers and rootswith the goal of creating new products,  and new income opportunities for Peruvian farmers.  
Operational Impacts Improving our potato chips means making them healthier.  And improving potato chip manufacturing means producing them in ways that use less waterfuel and electricity than before.  
Saving fuel through manufacturing equipment and vehicle efficiency.  In 2010,  we deployed high-efficiency heat exchangers to plants in the U.K.,  Portugal,  Spain and India,  that significantly improve heat transfer and recapture heat lost in the potato chip frying process.  Frito-Lay is Topeka,  Kansas,  facility has reduced its natural gas consumption per pound of product by 40 percent since 1999 by installing high-efficiency oven burners and a biomass boiler.  Meanwhile,  in South America,  our Green Stamp Program is optimizing vehicle efficiency through preventive maintenance,  regular vehicle inspectionsand guidance for truck drivers and route sales people on improving fuel-efficiency procedures.  To dateapproximately 80 percent of PepsiCo is fleet in PeruEcuador,  Chile,  Colombia,  Argentina and Venezuela has participated in the program.  
Reducing sodium through innovation.  In the U.K.,  Walkers has significantly reduced sodium by 25 to 55+ percent in its products since 2005.  In 2011Frito-Lay in the U.S.  expects to reduce sodium by nearly 25 percent,  on average,  across its entire flavored potato chip portfolio,  including Lay is.  We continue to invest in new approaches to reduce sodium in our savory snacks that deliver great taste with a very significant reduction in sodium.  
Walkers reduced sodium from 25 to 55+ % 
Making our plants greener is recognized internationally.  The company is ability to reduce emissions and energy use is reflected in Existing Buildings Gold Certifications from the U.S.  Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).  All togetherPepsiCo has 27 LEED-certified facilities,  including seven Frito-Lay sites in the U.S.,  its first in Russia and three certified facilities in China.  
Using heart-healthy oils to reduce saturated fats.  After removing nearly all trans fats from our U.S.  product portfolio and many of our global products,  we are committed to reducing the saturated fat content of our key global food brands.  One way is to use heart-healthy oils such as sunflower oil and rice bran oil.  In India,  for example,  blended rice bran oil has led to a 39 percent decrease in saturated fat in leading products such as Lay is potato chips.  
Consumer Impacts As a leading consumer products company,  we are always looking for ways to better serve the people who buy our snacks.  Increasingly,  that is being done by responding to the health needs of consumers and helping families understand the importance of good nutrition.  
Helping consumers manage their diets with smaller packages.  Since 2007,  Frito-Lay North America has offered many portion-controlled options,  including 100-calorie packssingles and multipacks of several products,  to help consumers manage their caloric intake.  
Increasing market share by responding to demand for allnatural ingredients.  
Improving children is health through exercise and better nutrition.  
We are committed to introducing new product options in markets where consumers are looking for a variety of choices while maintaining great taste.

PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Sourcing Impacts Reducing the impact of packaging on the environment through new bottle technologies and recycling,  and reducing added sugar to improve healthare important initiatives for Pepsi.  
Developing bottles out of plants that can be recycled with regular plastic.  PepsiCo has developed the world is first 100 percent plant-based bottle — a 100 percent resin,  zeropercent petroleum bottle that will help dramatically reduce our carbon footprint.  The new bottle meets stringent performance requirements for our beverages and is fully recyclable with current PET streams.  We will be scaling up the technology in 2011 for a pilot test market in 2012.  
Leading the U.S.  industry in reuse of plastic bottle resin.  We have been an industry leader in the innovative use of food-grade rPET in beverage containers in the U.S.  market.  In 2010,  we continued to meet our commitment by including an average of 10 percent rPET in our primary soft drink containers in the U.S.  
Conserving water in our bottling operations.  The China Beverage Industry Association honored 15 bottling plants in PepsiCo is Greater China Region (GCR) with the 2010 Excellent Water-Saving Enterprises awardwhich is given by a panel of industry experts.  Of a total of 44 award recipients,  the 15 PepsiCo awardees represent 65 percent of PepsiCo GCR bottling plants.  
rPET IN PRIMARY SOFT DRINK CONTAINERS 
Operational Impacts From reducing the caloric content of our beverages to reducing the weight of our packaging,  our operations are on a perpetual 'diet" to reduce or eliminate our environmental impacts.  
Helping consumers make easier choices on calories.  In countries where we have already provided basic nutritional information,  we are working toward an additional goal — displaying calorie or energy counts on the fronts of packages.  We have already implemented front-of-package labeling on a variety of our foods and beverages in many European countries,  as well as in Australia.  And we are rapidly expanding implementation in other countries,  including the U.S.,  Canada,  Mexico and Brazil.  
Reducing packaging weight with lightweight closures.  We continued to reduce the weight of our beverage containers in 2010 with the rollout of short-neck and lightweight closures for beverage packaging in sizes ranging from 355ml–2L.  By the end of 2010,  about 60 percent of our North American system (U.S.  and Canada) converted to the new lighter-weight designwhich reduced total packaging weight by more than 40 million pounds (equal to 1664 million 500ml Eco-Fina 109g bottles).  Conversion will be completed by the end of 2011.  Similar success was achieved in Mexico,  Peru and Argentina,  as well as markets in Asia,  the Middle East and Africa,  which collectively reduced plastic resin use an estimated incremental 12 million pounds.  
Developing sweeteners with fewer calories.  Pepsi Max,  containing no sugar but with a full flavoris our fastest-growing beverage brand internationally since 2008,  with significant product launches across the Middle East and China in 2010.  Pepsi ONE,  with only one calorie,  is another successful brand.  Pepsi Next,  with 60 percent less sugar,  will launch in test markets in the U.S.  in 2011,  and through our continued R&D investmentwe will develop additional lower-calorie products.  
MORE THAN 
POUNDS OF PACKAGING WEIGHT REDUCED 
Finding new uses for waste keeps landfills from filling.  In 2010,  PepsiCo,  including Pepsi-Cola facilities,  generated an estimated 125 million metric tons of solid waste from our manufacturing facilities in the U.S.  and U.K.  Of that total,  only 154 percent was discarded to a landfill,  and 846 percent of waste generated was sent off-site for beneficial use,  such as recycling.  
Consumer Impacts When it comes to popular beverages,  we must and will do more to encourage recycling as we find product options that satisfy changing tastes.  
Partnering on the Dream Machine expands bottle and can recycling.  
Developing sports-performance beverages supported by science.  
To improve can and plastic bottle recycling,  the Dream Machine recycling initiative is introducing recycling kiosks and bins at popular public locations across North America.  Since its launch in 2010,  we have installed almost 500 kiosks,  placed roughly 2000 bins,  and created recycling programs in more than 550 schools in 32 states.  We also collected approximately nine million units and more than 450000 pounds of plastic bottles and aluminum cans.  The campaign is a PepsiCo partnership with Waste Management,  Greenopolis and Keep America Beautiful.  The kiosks are computerized receptacles that include a personal reward system,  which allows consumers to earn points for every bottle or can they recycle in the kiosk.  Those points can then be redeemed for local discounts on entertainment,  dining and travel.  
Available in 80 countries,  the Gatorade brand is backed by the Gatorade Sports Science Institute,  which provides hydration and nutrition expertise,  as well as extensive research on sports nutrition and exercise science,  for health professionals,  athletes and other active consumers.  The leading facility of its kind,  the Institute tests athletes in the lab and in the field of play to understand the unique challenges of maintaining optimal performance.  With this perspective,  Gatorade introduced in 2010 the G Series,  a new line of tailored sports beverages that go beyond hydration to provide fuel,  fluid and nutrients before,  during and after intense exercise.  
Creating products for changing tastes grows liquid refreshment share.  Pepsi-Cola has been a leading brand for decades,  and we continually look for ways to expand the Pepsi line to meet the needs of a broader variety of consumers.  Sierra Mist Natural,  for example,  launched in 2010,  is made with nothing artificial — no preservatives,  no artificial flavors and no caffeine — a reinvention of traditional lemon-lime soda made with only five simple and natural ingredients.  We are also using an all-natural sweetener innovation in Gatorade,  the number one sports drink brand in the U.S, to produce G2 Gatorade,  which delivers the same electrolytes as Gatorade to help maintain hydration,  but with only 20 calories per eight-ounce serving.  And Mirindaa popular soft drink around the world,  is available in a range of fruit varieties,  including orange,  grapefruit,  applestrawberry,  raspberry,  pineapple,  banana,  passionfruitlemon,  hibiscus,  tangerine and grape.  
Giving back to the community through the Pepsi brand.  Launched in the U.S.  and Canada in 2010,  the Pepsi Refresh Project provided more than $20 million to fund a wide variety of projects across the U.S.  — everything from building playgrounds,  to providing musical instruments to students,  to supporting energy-efficiency installations.  In 2010,  84 million votes were cast for thousands of ideasand 400 grants were awarded as Pepsi Refresh Project grantees were estimated to have touched more than one million people across the country.  The Pepsi Refresh Project is going global in 2011.

Case Story Three Quaker Oats Products 
Quaker Oats are good for heart health,  adaptable to local tastes and easy to prepare.  Oats can also be grown with minimal environmental impact.  
Find out how PepsiCo is promoting sustainable agriculture and more food choices with this healthy grain.  
Case Stories 
PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Sourcing Impacts While growing oats is a relatively efficient agricultural enterprisewe still do what we can to reduce our impact with safer techniques that use fewer harmful insecticides and less water.  
Promoting  no till" techniques helps sow more oats.  While oats consume considerably less fertilizer than many other crops,  we are actively using and encouraging the use of safer agricultural chemicals and the recycling of agrochemical containers and packaging around the world,  to minimize their negative impact on the environment.  We have also promoted  no till, " a way of growing crops from year to year without disturbing the soil through excessive use of cultivation practices in the production of oats.  
Reducing water-use intensity in manufacturing.  Water and energy efficiencies have long been an environmental focus at PepsiCo.  Through 2010,  PepsiCo has improved water-use efficiency by 187 percent for foods manufacturing,  and 178 percent for beverage manufacturing.  These conservation efforts translate to a water savings of nearly 138 billion liters compared with the 2006 baseline.  
Operational Impacts Packaging and energy consumption go hand in hand.  Since one influences the other,  we strive to reduce or eliminate the use of both.  
Redesigning packaging lowers emissions and fuel consumption.  Beginning in 2008,  we reduced CO2 emissions by replacing the PVC tamper-band film with a PLA corn-based biopolymer film on all 18-ounce Quaker oatmeal and grits canisters.  Since then,  this change has removed 2625 tons of PVC from the waste stream,  which is equivalent to the CO2 emissions generated from 127026 gallons of gasoline.  This PLA film is made from a renewable resource and is certified to be compostable and biodegradable under certain conditions.  
Reducing natural gas use with steam boilers.  Our Quaker Oats facility in Bridgeview,  Illinois,  installed two high-efficiency gas-fired steam boilers,  which have reduced the facility is natural gas use by 16 percent in 2010 compared with previous technologies,  a savings of approximately $60000 a year.  
Consumer Impacts Health-conscious consumers and consumer advocates,  who seek more enjoyable and healthier food choices while striving for environmental sustainability,  are increasingly a large and powerful force in our world.  
Creating biomass from oat hulls helps power a university.  The Quaker Oats Cedar Rapids plant supplies oat hullsa milling byproduct,  to the University of Iowa as an alternative energy source.  Oat hulls represent approximately 20 percent of the fuel consumed at the University of Iowa power plant and 14 percent of its total purchased energy (fuel and electric).  
Educating Chinese consumers through a cholesterol challenge.  In China,  increased sales of our Quaker products have been a driver behind a 10 percent decrease in saturated fat per serving across our foods portfolio.  The China Cholesterol Education Program,  which launched a Quaker 30-Day Cholesterol Challenge Program,  invites consumers with elevated blood cholesterol levels to participate.  The program raised public awareness of the risks of high blood cholesterol and highlighted the importance of a healthy diet,  along with regular exercise,  to reduce cholesterol.  
Helping kids get a good start on the day with a healthy breakfast.  We know that Quaker Oats is a nutritious way to start the day.  So we have worked with Magic Breakfast since 2007 to donate Quaker Oats and Tropicana orange juice to primary schools in the poorest parts of the U.K.,  where one in four children live in poverty and thousands go to school without having eaten breakfast.  Magic Breakfast aims to provide a free,  nutritious breakfast to each child who would otherwise start the school day too hungry to learn.  By the end of 2010,  the partnership supported 172 schools,  up from 51 a year earlier,  feeding more than 5000 children each day in locations that include London,  Birmingham and Manchester.  Our target is to feed healthy breakfasts to 10000 children daily by 2012.  
Drawing attention to our high-fiber,  low-sodium and low-cholesterol products.  Three grams of soluble fiber daily from oatmeal,  in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol,  helps improve heart health.  That is why,  in Canada,  where consumers are looking for whole-grain foods,  the company is elevating the entire Quaker portfolio,  transforming more than 25 products by adding whole grain and reducing sodium and sugar.  These changes are being signaled on Quaker packaging,  as well.  Meanwhile,  Quaker Oats products are being offered as a healthy breakfast alternative in such leading food retail establishments as McDonald is and Starbucks.

Case Stories 
PepsiCo Sustainability Summary 2010 
Sourcing Impacts We have invested in improvements to our systems and facilities across our juice-making business,  resulting in less waste to landfillsmore sustainable packaging,  lower carbon footprints,  lower energy and water use and improved operational efficiencies.  
Piloting low-carbon fertilizers to lower the orange-growing footprints.  
Using less plastic to distribute more juice.  In the U.S.,  we are an industry leader in the innovative use of food-grade recycled PET in beverage containers.  Our Naked juice is now in a 100 percent rPET RenewBottle in the U.S.,  and we are expanding use globally in 2011.  In the third quarter of 2010,  we began to sell 15-liter Tropicana containers made with 50 percent recycled PET in Franceone of our busiest Tropicana markets.  This change represents an annual savings of approximately 11 million pounds of resin.  In 2011,  we have plans to expand our use of recycled PET in countries outside the U.S.  by more than 25 million pounds.  
With almost 40 percent of the carbon footprint of orange juice production coming from farming — the main contributor is the manufacture of standard fertilizers — we launched a three-year,  7200-tree pilot project in Florida in 2010,  which is designed to compare low-carbon fertilizers with standard fertilizer and measure the impact on tree and soil health and juice quality.  If successful,  the greener fertilizers could lower the carbon footprint of PepsiCo is citrus growers by as much as 50 percent and reduce the total carbon footprint of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice by up to 20 percent.  
Cleaning bottles with air saves billions of liters of water.  In the U.S.,  a technique for cleaning new Gatorade bottles with purified air,  instead of water,  has been so successful,  we are extending this and other conservation techniques to bottling plants around the world,  with the opportunity to save billions of liters of water a year.  The Aquafina brand also uses an innovative method to save water during its packaging process — by feeding the pre-forms of bottles directly onto a blow molder.  This technique produces a sanitary bottle and fills it directlyso there is no need to rinse the bottles with water.  
Certifying the impact of the orange juice product life cycle.  Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice became the first consumer brand in North America to be independently certified by the Carbon Trust.  To measure its footprintTropicana partnered with third-party experts at the Columbia Earth Institute and the Carbon Trust to study every facet of the product life cycle — from growing and squeezing oranges to the packaging end-of-life recycling or disposal.  We have also studied the components of our water footprint for Tropicana packaged in Belgium and produced with oranges from Brazil,  to better understand the local impacts of our water use.  
Operational Impacts By using recyclable bottle materials and expanding our reach internationally,  we are strengthening our leadership position in the healthy juice market worldwide.  
Making a statement with a 100 percent recycled bottle.  Naked juice became the first nationally distributed brand to transition to a 100 percent post-consumer recycledPET plastic bottle.  We use about 98 million pounds of bottle-grade post-consumer recycled-PET resin in our U.S.  packaging portfolio — the largest by any soft drink manufacturing company in the U.S.  It is important to note that PepsiCo would use recycled plastic in all of its qualified bottles,  if the supply of food-grade recycled-PET resin was available.  
Acquiring the biggest juice maker in Europe spreads healthy choices.  With our acquisition of Lebedyansky in 2008,  we not only became the number one juice company across Europebut we sold more than 230 million servings of 100 percent juice in Russia in 2010,  increasing the amount of wholesome foods and beverages we provide around the world.  
Consumer Impacts We believe in providing people with choices — a variety of enjoyable and healthier foods,  to improve their health and encourage them to become physically active.  
Dropping calories with Trop50 without dropping natural taste.  Tropicana is Trop50,  the juice industry is most successful launch in recent years,  offers 50 percent less sugar and fewer calories by using a zero-calorie,  all-natural sweetener.  In March 2011,  Trop50 was named one of the Top 10 food and beverage brands in 2010,  by sales,  according to the SymphonyIRI Group.  
Providing rewards to juice drinkers for active pursuits and to the planet.  
Creating custom juices for digestion,  energy and medicinal herbs.  
The Juicy Rewards program was a first for Tropicana in 2010.  Consumers who purchased participating Tropicana products entered codes at juicyrewards, tropicana, com for savings on thousands of healthy and family-friendly pursuits.  In 2010,  PepsiCo consumers redeemed 522000 healthy rewards,  which included everything from fitness equipment to a trip to a national park.  In addition,  through a partnership with Cool Earth,  Tropicana consumers helped protect more than 341 million square feet of rain forest in Peru (juicyrewards, tropicana, com/rainforest).  
In Russia,  our Lebedyansky juice business has developed Tonus Active Plus,  a new line of juices for health-conscious consumers.  We are also growing our beverage portfolio in China with a variety of locally designed and developed products — Xian Guo Li seasonal juices and Cao Ben Le ('happy herb") drinks,  which incorporate familiar Chinese medicinal herbs such as red dates and chrysanthemums.  
Championing sustainable agriculture in support of human health.  One such example where we are integrating healthenvironment and agriculture is the sustainabilitycertification program we are developing for work with our suppliers,  including our orange growers.  This program is built on,  and will fully integratethree pillars: environmental,  social and economic sustainability.  The program brings growers along on the sustainability journey; it doesn't presume that one day they are unsustainable and the next they are golden.  Andmost critically,  participation in this program will help to let our growers know that sustainability is all about integrating multiple concerns.
