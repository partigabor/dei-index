2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
Letter from the Chairman and CEO As we strive to refresh the world,  The Coca-Cola Company and our local bottling partners are committed to creating new value for our consumersour customers and the communities we proudly serve across more than 200 countries and territories.  Every day,  we get up with a passion for making a lasting,  positive difference in people is lives.  As we do,  we are continuously seeking to better integrate our sustainability efforts into our daily actions.  This,  to us,  is the secret formula for making our business more sustainable: integrating sustainability into the very heart of the enterprise,  where our efforts create value for our shareowners and the wider world beyond.  As you'll see in this report,  we made significant progress in 2014 in advancing our top three sustainability priorities in support of Women,  Water and Well-Being.  In terms of Women,  we increased the total number of women entrepreneurs impacted by our 5by20™ initiative to nearly 865000 since 2010.  We continue to replicate and scale effective programs as we pursue the economic empowerment of 5 million women worldwide by 2020.  Through our Water programs,  we balanced the equivalent of an estimated 94 percent of the water used in our finished beverages in 2014,  putting us on track to potentially meet our 100 percent water replenishment target ahead of 2020.

In Well-Being,  we continue our commitment to inspire happier,  healthier lives.  We introduced more than 100 reduced-,  low- and no-calorie beveragescontinued to increase the availability of small packages,  and supported more than 330 active,  healthy living programs across 112 markets.  Our success in these priorities is directly linked to our system is sustainable business growth.  We advance toward our 2020 sustainability commitments by unlocking the collaborative power of the 'Golden Triangle" of business,  government and civil society.  Indeed,  some of our most exciting opportunities come from programs at the intersection of WomenWater and Well-Being like Project Unnati or EKOCENTER™—initiatives that serve to strengthen our supply chain,  our business and our communities.  We have seen success from programs that reinforce our enduring view that sustainability spurs innovation,  just as innovation spurs sustainability.  One example is EKOCYCLE™,  which encourages recycling by using recycled materials such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans to create desirable consumer products.  As an industry leader,  we often choose to set demanding targets that drive fundamental change,  even while 
understanding that attaining such goals is not guaranteed.  For example,  we committed our system to work toward buying and installing only HFC-free coolers by 2015.  While we have led the industry and placed more than 14 million such coolers in the market—including approximately 297500 in 2014—we are off track to reach this goal.  Sourcing HFC-free coolers presents challenges in many markets,  but we continue to make progress,  having invested more than $100 million over the past decade to make our coolers more environmentally friendly.  Overall,  we are pleased—but not satisfied—with our sustainability progress and the milestones we have reached.  As we advance our reporting and disclosures,  we continue to support and measure our sustainability progress against the principles outlined in the United Nations Global Compact.  For 
this year and beyond,  we are committed to building on the successes of 2014further integrating sustainability into our business and gaining fresh momentum.  Thank you for your interest in The Coca-Cola Company and our sustainability report.  I invite you to follow our progress on Coca-Cola Journey.  As we keep moving toward our 2020 sustainability commitments,  we welcome your input and look forward to hearing from you.   Very best wishes Muhtar Kent Chairman and CEO The Coca-Cola Company

well as sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients.  These goals apply to the Coca-Cola system.  Our dashboard below provides an overview of our 2020 sustainability commitments.  These commitments extend across the entire Coca-Cola 
system,  which includes all of our nearly 250 independent bottling partners.  We have set ambitious targets to drive systemwide change beyond small operational improvements.  We do not own most of the companies that comprise our bottling system,  but we feel it is important to strive for large-scale success and to 
provide leadership that will raise the bar for our system and our industry.  We also continue to report against some goals that are set to be completed in 2015which can be found in the chapters on Climate Protection,  Packaging and Human and Workplace Rights.  
GOAL 
PROGRESS 
Offer low- or no-calorie beverage options in every market.  
We offer reduced-,  low- or no-calorie options in 191 markets in which we operate.  
Provide transparent nutrition information,  featuring calories on the front of all of our packages.  
Nearly all markets provided front-of-pack calorie information following our global policy on nutrition labeling that was in place during the 2014 year.  
Help get people moving by supporting physical activity programs in every country where we do business.  
Through 2014,  we supported more than 330 active,  healthy living programs in 112 markets.  
Market responsibly,  including no advertising directly to children under 12 anywhere in the world.  
In 2014,  we enhanced our policy to extend across all forms of media.  Perhaps more significantly,  our policy now indicates that we will not develop marketing designed to directly appeal to children under 12.  
Enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women across our global value chain.  
In 2014,  we enabled approximately 313000 women,  making a total of nearly 865000 since 2010.  
Achieve at least 98% compliance with independent franchise bottling partners and 95% compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles among our suppliers.  
As of December 31,  2014,  88% of our bottling partners and 90% of our direct suppliers had achieved compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles.  
Give back at least 1% of the Company is operating income annually.  
In 2014,  The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Company together gave back $126 million,  or 13% of our operating income.  
Safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equivalent to what we use in our finished beverages and their production.  
We balanced an estimated 94% of the equivalent amount of water used in our finished beverages (based on 2014 sales volume).  
Improve water efficiency in manufacturing operations by 25% compared with a 2010 baseline.  
In 2014,  we used an average of 203 liters of water for each liter of product produced—a 10% improvement since 2010—moving us toward our 2020 goal to use 17 liters of water per liter of product produced.  
Work with our partners to recover and recycle the equivalent of 75% of the bottles and cans we introduce into developed markets.  
We estimate a 61% recovery rate in developed markets currently.  
Reduce the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" by 25%.  
Draft reduction targets have been set through 2020 by business units.  
Sustainably source our key agricultural ingredients.  
We developed a new seven-step Supplier Engagement Program,  which outlines various pathways to achieve compliance with our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principlesand convened 14 workshops in eight different regions in the world.

Our Approach Throughout the Company is history,  we have strived to support the communities we serve.  We take pride in the special relationship we have built with our consumers in every corner of the globe.  And we work every day to maintain that relationship and ensure that we provide consumers with the products and information they need to stay refreshed.  As consumers become more involved in both their personal well-being and broader global public health challenges such as obesity,  we are working to ensure we do our part.  With our global well-being commitments as our foundation,  we have focused our efforts on providing consumers with expanded beverage choices and transparent nutrition information,  while also supporting more inclusive active,  healthy living programs in communities around the world.  We are also working to ensure that across all media our marketing does not target children under the age of 12.

In addition to the expansion of reduced-,  low- and no-calorie beverages,  a critical component of our business and well-being strategy is the expansion of smaller package sizes in markets around the world.  Whether it is our mini-cans or small glass bottles,  we are better able to provide great-tasting refreshment in moderation,  allowing consumers to choose their portion size.  In 2014,  81 countries expanded their portfolio of beverages available in small packages; we now offer these in 186 countries.

policy guides us in providing factual,  meaningful and understandable information consumers can reference to meet their individual needs.  Nearly all markets provided front-of-pack calorie information following our global policy on nutrition labeling that was in place during the 2014 year.  We continue to pursue ways to enhance our front-ofpack labeling.  For example,  to avoid needless package waste,  front-of-pack calorie information will be added to refillable/returnable glass bottles and refillable PET bottles as new packaging is introduced.  Multi-use bottles without printed labels and some mineral waters will remain exempt,  with nutrient information to be provided via Company websites.

to finalize in 2015.  These will require at least one of the active,  healthy living programs we support in each market to meet these new standards.  The new criteria will require,  for example,  qualifying programs to be as inclusive as possible,  offer opportunity for ongoing participation and commit to multi-year duration.  Qualified programs in each country where we operate will be subject to audit to ensure full compliance.  
Based on our responsible marketing policy,  we do not buy advertising placements that target children,  defined as audiences with 35 percent or more of viewers under the age of 12.  In 2014,  we enhanced our policy to extend across all forms of media.  In addition,  our policy now indicates that we will not develop marketing designed to directly appeal to children under 12.  
Supporting Physical Activity Goal: Help get people moving by supporting physical activity programs in every country where we do business.  Progress: On track.  In 2014,  we supported more than 330 active,  healthy living programs in 112 markets around the world,  and we are working to ensure there are robust active,  healthy living programs everywhere we operate.  Additionally,  in 2014,  together with The Coca-Cola Foundation,  we awarded nearly $22 million to support nutrition and physical activity programs in 40 countries across our global system.  Research has shown that regular physical activity is paramount to attaining and maintaining good health.  Therefore,  a key pillar of our well-being efforts is supporting programs that make exercise and movement accessible to as many people as possible.

Managing Product & Ingredient Safety In Our Supply Chain 
Ingredient Safety 
Our consumers deserve safe,  refreshing and high-quality beverages,  and across the Coca-Cola system,  we work hard to meet the highest standards of product safety and quality.  It is our goal to offer safe and refreshing beverages to all of our consumers around the world.  We follow stringent product and ingredient standards designed to ensure the safety and quality of each of our products.  13 
2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
Our Approach To achieve consistent safety and quality,  we have strong governance practices in placeand we work diligently to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and standards.  We stay up to date with new regulations,  industry best practices,  and marketplace trends and conditions,  and we engage with standardsetting and industry organizations.  Additionally,  our strict product manufacturing and distribution policiesrequirements and specifications are managed through our integrated quality management program called the Coca-Cola Operating Requirements (KORE).  The quality and safety of all systemwide operations are monitored and measured against the same rigorous standards.  Our quality management program helps us identify and mitigate risks and drive improvements.  We stringently test and measure quality attributes of our beverages in modern laboratories at every step of production.  This due diligence is performed in all of the countries and territories where our products are produced and sold.  We also consistently reassess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve them across our entire supply chain.  
Managing Product & Ingredient Safety In Our Supply Chain In 2014,  we continued to drive effective product safety and quality compliance through unannounced 
Intro 
audits of our manufacturing facilities around the world.  Unannounced audits help ensure that manufacturing facilities across our system are 'auditready" at all times and are operating in accordance with KORE standards.  We recognize that quality 'risks" are not all equal; therefore,  we evaluate risks in order to focus our system resources where they can create the most impact.  Our Supplier Management Program is designed to identify and assess potential supplier risks.  It provides assurance and documentation that our suppliers are capable of consistently providing our plants with ingredients and packaging materials that meet our Company is stringent specifications.  One of the main focus areas of the program is to ensure that corrective actions are taken on a timely basis.  This minimizes or eliminates risks that could potentially cause issues with continuity of supply.  Our program includes the requirement for an annual risk assessment of each supply point and the periodic evaluation of the supplier is performance and facilities based on risk level.  We continue to require our suppliers to achieve certification under the recognized Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standard.  Through supplier development and capability-building programs such as the GFSI Global Markets Programme and otherswe continue to strengthen the quality and food safety assurance processes of our supply base.  In 2014,  82 percent of our ingredient suppliers were certified according to GFSI standards,  and 77 percent of our packaging suppliers were certified.  Ensuring the safety and quality of our products has always been at the core of our business and is directly linked to the success of The Coca-Cola Company.  Our Company Global Product Quality Index rating has consistently reached 95 since 2010,  while our Company Global Packaging Quality Index has remained steady since 2010 at an average rating of 93.

Ingredient Safety Ensuring the safety and quality of our products has always been essential to The Coca-Cola Company.  Our commitment begins with making sure all ingredients we use have been carefully inspected for their safety and quality and have come from reliabletrusted sources.  If we had any concerns about the safety of an ingredient,  we simply would not use it.  We also review and evaluate emerging scientific research and evolving consumer trends related to ingredients.  We want to share safe and refreshing beverages with consumers around the world and believe that all our products can be part of a healthybalanced lifestyle.  We also update the formulation of our products when appropriate for greater quality and consistency in production.  For example,  we are continuing our transition from the use of brominated vegetable oil (BVO) to sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) and/or glycerol ester of rosin (singly or in combination).  BVO was traditionally used as an emulsifier in some of our beverages,  including some citrus-flavored products.  By the end of 2014,  the replacement of BVO for these products was more than 90 percent complete and is slated to be fully complete by the end of 2015.    In every part of the world where we have operations and sell our products,  we abide by the laws and regulations of each local market,  including regulations pertaining to health,  safety and product labeling.  Every ingredient we use in each product we make must meet or exceed these standards.  We remain committed to providing our consumers with transparent nutrition information about all of our products so that they can make beverage choices that fit their lifestyles.  From ingredients to packagingwe aim to provide up-to-date and engaging information online at Coca-Cola FAQs.

Our Approach There is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has both immediate impacts that benefit them directly and larger ripple effects that are good for society more broadly.  As pillars of their communities,  women invest a sizable portion of the income they earn on the health and education of their children and in their local economies,  creating a tremendous economic impact.  Our recognition of both the challenges faced by women and their economic potential led to the development of our 5by20TM initiative in 2010.  5by20 is our commitment to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs

Migrant Workers Recognizing that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking,  in 2014 we reviewed our policies and due-diligence activities with the aim of better respecting the human rights of such workers throughout our supply chain.    We publicly committed to three principles related to the recruitment and employment of migrant workers: 1.  Employment terms are represented in a truthful,  clear manner and in the language understood by workers prior to employment.  2.  Worker does not pay recruitmentplacement or transportation fees (including transportation to and from host country).  3.  Worker has access to personal identity documents.  These principles,  along with our strong overall prohibition of forced labor,  align with President Obama is anti-trafficking Executive Order 13627 of 2012 and create a framework for responsible and transparent recruitment and employment practices.  Read more about this topic on page 14 of our Global Human and Workplace Rights Issue Guidance.  
Land Rights Over the past decade,  we believe we have made significant progress in implementing and demonstrating respect for human rights across our supply chain.  Frequently this involves complicated issues and multiple 
stakeholders with competing interests.  One such issue relates to land.  In 2013,  we developed an action plan to address land rights in our supply chain,  including zero tolerance for 'land grabs. " In 2014 and 2015,  our work on land rights has centered on building the Coca-Cola system is knowledge and capabilities; establishing requisite policies; and engaging with our NGO partners,  bottling partners and suppliers.  As part of our commitment,  we plan to undertake 28 third-party country studies on land rights,  child labor and forced labor through 2020,  including our top cane-sugar-sourcing countries.  These baseline studies serve as an important vehicle to build systemwide understanding of our policies and enable us to better mitigate potential future violations.  They will serve as a factual basis upon which to build improvement plans involving our suppliers as well as government and nongovernmental organizations as appropriate.  Initial studies focused on Colombia and Guatemalaand the results were made public in March 2015.

In addition,  we are updating our Supplier Guiding Principles implementation guide,  which will further address land rights.  We have worked closely with select suppliers on alleged land rights violations following allegations in Cambodia and Brazil made by Oxfam and directly to the Company.

Respecting the Rights of Migrant Workers in Singapore As per local laws and customary practices,  employment agencies sending migrant workers to Singapore typically charge a fee of up to two months' salary for each year of an employment contract.  The worker also pays for the airfare from the home country.

In collaboration with other AIM In October 2014,  we hosted a convening on land rights in Atlanta with 25 external experts who provided input and shared best practices on conducting studies related to land rights.  As a result of their input,  we revised the initial two studies prior to public release.  
PROGRESS members,  we co-hosted supplier capacity-building events in New Delhi,  Nairobi,  Johannesburg and Lagos during 2014.  The forums reached nearly 500 participants.   During these day-long eventskey business leaders from the participating companies discussed the importance of responsible sourcing to customers and stakeholders and to the sustainability of their businesses.  The training covered methods and tools used to verify compliance with social and environmental standards and provided a forum to share questions and best practices.  Supplier engagement on human rights can have a measurable—even dramatic—impact.  In India,  we have employed a multipronged strategy including top-level management engagement,  industry engagementinternal compliance scorecardssupplier training,  supplier capacity building and a supplier awards system.  As a result,  suppliers in India have moved from a 6 percent level of compliance to the Supplier Guiding Principles in 2007 to a 98 percent level at the end of 2014.  
Our country studies also help to set a baseline for determining the participation of child labor and forced labor,  with a focus on our sugar supply chain.  We welcome the ongoing input of many stakeholders,  including,  most recently,  the American Federation of Teachers (AFT),  who provide input into our human rights due-diligence studies on issues related to child labor.  The AFT has also agreed to collaborate on approaches to the remediation of child labor (when it is identified) and the advancement of school attendanceincluding engaging with a broader group of stakeholders,  as needed.  We believe our actions in 2014 demonstrated our responsiveness to concerns expressed by the publicNGOs and observers in social and traditional media.  We also take a proactive approach,  going beyond auditing individual facilities to investigating issues deeper in our value chain and more broadly in the societies in which we operate.  This approach informs and guides us when we work with stakeholders to mitigate the problems that arise.

2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
Our Safety Record for 2014 Our lost-time incident rate for The Coca-Cola Company remained steady at 19 in 2014.  The Company maintained this rate while managing the increased complexity brought on by the acceleration of our refranchising process in North America and the addition of new territories within our Bottling Investments Group.  Despite our diligent efforts to improve overall safety management,  we regret that two Company associates and four contractors lost their lives in 2014 in incidents during the course of work.  There were three vehicle incidents (one in China and two in India) and two armed robberies in Guatemala.  One contractor died as a result of a fall from height while performing roof maintenance in Bahrain.  In addition to the actions taken to address each of these specific incidents,  we continue to focus on vehicle safety,  contractor safety,  and fall prevention and protection.  Additionallywe continue to improve our security procedures to identify and minimize the risks due to armed robberies in the areas in which we operate.  
Improving Route-to-Market Safety Improving route-to-market safety remains a key priority for the Company.  Route-tomarket,  or RTM,  is defined as the movement of products and people between our bottling plants and our customers.  RTM is characterized by a complex chain of events that varies greatly throughout the world and often involves third-party partners.  Because everything from cars and trucks to canoes and motorcycles is used to distribute our products,  solutions must be developed and implemented at a local level.  
Me 
In 2014 and 2015,  we continued RTM safety workshops in areas experiencing higher rates of vehicle-related incidents,  such as Ghana,  South Africa,  Azerbaijan,  Turkey,  the Philippines and Costa Rica.  The workshops are designed to share best practices and build real solutions in areas including route risk management,  driver training and vehicle inspection and maintenance.  They also help to develop a systemwide network for best-practice sharing and problem solving.  Our system encompasses nearly 250 bottling partners and several thousand distribution centers.  Our goal is to reach alignment on a common safety vision,  educate associates on good safety practices and continuously improve safety performance throughout the system.  
Supporting Associate Well-Being The Coca-Cola system includes more than 700000 associates,  of whom approximately 129200 comprised The Coca-Cola Company is global workforce in 2014.  While each office and function

Given the accelerating pace of business and change,  it has become more important than ever to uphold our commitment to support the physical,  emotionalsocial and financial well-being of all employees.  In 2014,  we announced our well-being strategy to provide personalized support,  opportunities for social engagement and accessible resources to all employees.  To execute on the strategy,  we are rolling out six global initiatives: an Employee Assistance Program,  a well-being assessmentwell-being coaching,  an activity-tracking programannual global activity challenges,  and virtual wellbeing centers.  In addition,  we have developed a global wellbeing champion network to activate well-being in the local workplaces.  Our well-being champions and other associates have organized office-wide participation in running events and inspired fun and community through gatherings such as the Coke Music Moments™.

Valuing Diversity Embracing diversity of thought,  background and culture in our business decision making is essential in order for our business to continue to thrive in a multicultural world.  Our commitment to this principle is embodied in our Human Rights Policy.  The policy helps our employees understand how to value diversity and inclusion,  maintain a workplace free of discrimination and harassment,  and report potential violations to the Company without fear of retaliation.  We have a strategic Global Diversity & Workplace Fairness 'Roadmap for Growth" that seeks to embed an inclusion mindset in our business and its leaders though awareness building,  metrics and converting insights into actionable steps that strengthen our business and its brands.  This work is stewarded by our employee led diversity councils and business resource affinity groups.

What is Next In 2015,  we are planning two Human Rights Conferences.  We plan to conduct additional third-party country studies on land rights,  child labor and forced labor on our way to conducting 28 studies by 2020.  Finally,  we plan to update and align the language and terminology from our Supplier Guiding Principles—which apply to our bottling partners and suppliers—with our Human Rights Policy.  Most importantly,  in 2015 we'll continue the daily task of identifying human rights and workplace risks and mitigating harm,  not just in our Company but also throughout our value chain.  We'll work to equip the Coca-Cola system with the guidelinestools and communication channels they need to join this effort.

At first glance,  an EKOCENTER kiosk looks like a red box where people buy the basic goods they need to live.  But an EKOCENTER kiosk does more.  Typically run by a woman entrepreneurEKOCENTER kiosks empower communities with the aim to provide a variety of utilities,  goods and serviceshelping spur growth and development.  The EKOCENTER program combines the elements of business with philanthropy to deliver public benefits via a method known as social enterprise.  In this 
model,  the woman entrepreneur and the EKOCENTER kiosk are supported through the revenue generated by the provision of goods and services,  even as basic utilities are provided at little or no cost.   Under Coca-Cola is leadership,  the EKOCENTER initiative is collaborating with many other private sectornongovernmental and government partners.  In 2014,  we strengthened our ongoing partnership with IBM,  McCann Health,  Pentair,  Global Water Challenge and others.  We also worked with new partners,  like Ericsson,  to help pilot a new connectivity model in Rwanda.  Our main technology and implementation partner is SOLARKIOSK,  a German company that designed the current EKOCENTER kiosk.

Progress: Ahead of target.  Between 2005 and the end of 2014,  through 209 community water partnership projects in 61 countries,  we balanced an estimated 94 percent of the equivalent amount of water used in our finished beverages (based on 2014 sales volume).  This totals approximately 1536 billion liters of water replenished to communities and nature2.

Assessing Water Source Risks Through our water stewardship program,  we have implemented a rights-based approach to water.  We require our system is bottling plants to assess vulnerabilities of the quality and quantity of their community water sources and production water (if they differ); determine potential impacts from our water use and discharge of wastewater; and then address the issues identified in the development and implementation of a source water protection plan (SWPP).  With our new systemwide database,  we have been able to streamline our tracking and reporting processthereby strengthening our governance ability.  As a resultby the end of 2014,  all the bottling plants in the system conducted a source water vulnerability assessment,  and the majority of plants began SWPP implementation.

They address numerous water issues related to the needs and growth of our business and of the communities where we operate.  We seek not only to maintain regulatory compliance,  but also to build a Company culture focused on water resource sustainability.  
Recycling and Treating Water We continue our commitment to return to the environment—at a level that supports aquatic life— recycled wastewater from our manufacturing process.  For all new,  existing and acquired facilities,  the water we return is cleaned and treated to meet our own high internal standards and achieve full compliance with local regulations.  In 2014,  we achieved 99 percent alignment with our wastewater treatment standards.  A few plants still need to meet this standard and are delayed due to extenuating circumstances in their region.  In order to accelerate improvements to the quality of water our facilities recycle and discharge back into the environment,  as well as the efficiency with which we process that water,  we are currently transitioning our wastewater governance and technical support programs into a performance-based model.

Intro 
2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
Our Approach The gradual increase in our atmosphere is average temperature is causing concern that erratic weather patterns and severe natural disasters will become more frequent around the world.  Climate scientists continue to provide evidence that this increase is due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.  This poses major challenges for the natural environment and for the communities in which we operate.  It could also affect our business and supply chain in the long run.  Our Company relies on natural resources and raw materials for our productsespecially water and agricultural commodities such as sugarcane,  cornsugar beets,  citrus,  coffee and tea.  Climate change could exacerbate water scarcity or reduce water quality in certain regions.  Water— the main ingredient in most of our products—is vital to our manufacturing processes and to the cultivation of our agricultural ingredients.  So the impact of climate change on water availability is of special concern to us.  As we discuss in our position statement on climate protection,  the Coca-Cola system is committed to making changes in our operations geared toward reducing our climate impact.  We are striving to reduce emissions from our manufacturing processes and also driving collaboration throughout our supply chain to reduce emissions associated with the growing of our ingredients,  the production of our packaging,  and the distribution and refrigeration of our products.  
Evolution of Our Goals Some years back,  we set aggressive 2015 goals in the areas of climate and packaging.  As we detail in this section,  we have already met some of these goals,  are on track to achieve others,  and will fall short of achieving our targets in a few areas.  Recognizing the role we play as an industry leaderwe have regularly opted for setting demanding targets to drive fundamental change,  rather than just incremental improvement,  across our bottling system,  even while understanding that their attainment was not guaranteed.  And as we have advanced in these efforts with our bottling partnerswe have often helped to positively influence the progress in our industry as well.  We provide reflections on the journey toward our 2015 goals in Our Progress.  The Company and our bottling partners remain committed to our work on programs related to climate protection and sustainable packaging.  We will continue to make progress on these important programs.  Moving forward,  the work our system has been doing toward our 2015 goals,  as described in this section around refrigeration and manufacturing emissions and in our Sustainable Packaging section around renewable and recycled contentand material resource efficiency,  will continue to be tracked and reported transparently within our overarching goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" by 25 percent by 2020.  This shift in how we capture and share our progress reflects the critical—and multifaceted—challenge that climate change poses to the globe and to our business.  Our evolved approach integrates several aspects of our sustainability framework,  including those around packaging and sustainable agriculture.  And it maximizes the flexibility of our business and our bottling partners to pursue whichever efforts are most effective toward meeting this overarching goal.

As we have traveled along our journey to embed our sustainability framework into our business,  we have learned about the importance of giving our system flexibility in how they support initiatives.  Our carbon footprint can be reduced through efforts involving packaging,  agricultural ingredientsmanufacturing,  distribution and refrigeration.  Which strategies are best depends strongly on local conditions.  With this in mind,  we have equipped our business unit leaders with tools to determine the best interventions and to measure their progress (see Sustainable Packaging).  And we plan to hold these business unit leaders accountable for their progress.  
Our Progress Goal: Reduce the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" by 25 percent by 2020.  
Progress: Draft reduction targets have been set through 2020 by business units.  We are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our entire value chain by making comprehensive changes in our manufacturing processes,  packaging formats,  delivery fleet,  refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing.  To empower global managers to reach this goal,  we have developed a Carbon Scenario Planner to help standardize a forecast methodology for carbon in the system supply chain and to support regional target setting.  In 2014,  all our business unit leaders utilized the Planner to evaluate a portfolio of carbon reduction interventions and develop initial annual reduction targets.  In 2014,  we also entered an assurance readiness process with a third-party assurance provider to assess the program design and reporting processes related to the 'drink in your hand" goal.

2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
We have since implemented a number of recommendations arising from this assessment.  As part of our work to reduce our carbon footprint,  we aim to reduce the greenhouse emissions of our distribution trucking fleet,  the source of about 4 percent of our value chain emissions.  Our global system is fleet,  which includes trucks operated by our Company and our bottling partners,  emitted an estimated 37 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2014.  Though they currently compose a small portion of our fleet,  we continue to add delivery trucks that are powered with a mix of alternative fuelsincluding electricitynatural gas,  dieselelectric and biodiesel.  
HFC-Free Coolers Goal: As of 2015,  all new cold-drink equipment will be HFC-free across our global system.  Progress: Off track.  In 2014we placed approximately 297500 units of HFC-free equipment (approximately 30 percent of new equipment purchases),  bringing our global total to more than 14 million units.  
Refrigeration is the largest source of our system is carbon emissions footprint.  Because of the high global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),  we are phasing out the use of HFC refrigerants in our cold-drink equipment across our global value chain.  About 40 percent of our 14 million HFC-free coolers are CO2-based.  CO2 has 1430 times less global warming potential than typical HFC refrigerant gas.  CO2-refrigerated equipment has been in the marketplace for almost a decade and has been proven reliablewith a lower lifetime cost.  All told,  the Coca-Cola system has invested more than $100 million over the past decade to make our coolers more environmentally responsible.  We have certified 230 cooler models as meeting our performance standards.  More than three-quarters of these certified models are more energyefficient than legacy models,  and 60 percent have a higher cooling capacity.  Nearly 40 percent are certified to perform in hot or humid conditions.  In some markets,  more than 75 percent of our cooling system purchases are HFC-free.  But higher costs and difficulty in sourcing HFCfree equipment in certain countries have hindered our progress.  We have also faced challenges developing HFC-free coolers in certain categoriessuch as countertop units.  We will continue to track our progress against this goal as we align

Around the World The Behavior-based Energy Efficiency (BEE) program aims to transform energy management practices at our approximately 900 manufacturing sites by building a culture of energy efficiency.  BEE focuses on the impact that individual and group behaviors have on the effectiveness of implementing and sustaining energysaving measures.  The program drives 
2014/2015 Sustainability Report 
productivity gains by focusing on low- and no-cost behavior changes that can make a big impact at scale—things like turning off equipment and conveyors when not in use,  turning off the lights,  repairing air and steam leaks and optimizing set points.  The BEE framework can be used on a production site to benchmark the existing energy management status; investigate how systems,  procedures,  policies and habits influence behaviors; and identify opportunities to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy waste.  BEE programs external to Coca-Cola have achieved energy savings in excess of 15 percent through no- and low-cost actions.  In May 2014,  the Coca-Cola Refreshments facility in Tempe,  Arizona,  began the first BEE pilot.  The team has developed and tested a range of materials and activities supporting behavior change.  Early reviews onsite show evidence of energy savings in excess of 10 percent and improved energy management and behavior changes as a result of the BEE program.  Monitoring will continue at the site,  and the lessons from the pilot will shape expansion of the BEE program to additional international sites in 2015.  
Partnerships 
The U.S.  government is National Climate Assessment confirms that climate disruptions to agriculture in the United States have been increasing.  In 2014,  we joined the White House is Climate Data Initiative to connect America is agricultural sector to the data it needs to gauge the impact of climate change and to help protect our fragile climate.  We have committed to further expanding our Field to Market® program,  which helps farmers visualize and assess the impact of various management decisions on energy efficiencies and environmental impacts.  Farmers can also compare their performance against local,  state and national averages developed using publicly available data.  In 2014,  we launched major initiatives with two of our four leading suppliers to implement this commitment.  By the end of 2015,  we aim to engage farmers collectively representing 250000 acres,  and by 2020,  up to 1 million acres—about 50 percent of our global corn supply.  Field to Market grew out of an initiative from the Keystone Policy Center,  which was established to facilitate the resolution of national policy conflicts.  In June 2014,  we received the Keystone Policy Center is Environmental Leadership Award in recognition of our leadership in water,  climate,  packaging and agriculture.  This was only the second time a corporation has won in the 20-year history of this award.  
Our partnerships with other businesses,  governments and civil society have been key to our progress on climate protection programs.  At the United Nations Climate Summit in September 2014,  we signed a statement supporting an amendment to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol.  We joined the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and committed to help the Coalition responsibly manage climate impacts.  Our experience with implementing HFC-free refrigeration in commercial coolers and vending machines will contribute to transitioning to HFC-free capabilities in other sectors.

In 2015Coca-Cola Enterprises will participate in the Conference of Parties 21 in Paris.  
What is Next In 2015,  we will continue monitoring progress toward our 2020 goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" as we and our bottling partners implement local carbon reduction programs.  As described above,  the work our system has been doing toward our 2015 goals will continue to be tracked and reported within our overarching goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" across our value chain by 25 percent by 2020.  This includes tracking and reporting progress in our ongoing efforts around previous goals related to refrigeration,  manufacturing emissions,  renewable and recycled content,  and material resource efficiency.  We will also continue assisting our markets in assessing and investing in clean energy opportunities as they arise.

Phase 1 of the program propagated the method of ultrahigh-density farming for mango plantations,  which significantly conserves water and land resources by using drip irrigation and high tree densities in combination with a specialized pruning process.  The method also decreases the time it takes to bring new mango plantings to maturity.

Stakeholder Engagement Engaging our diverse stakeholders in long-term dialogue provides important input that informs our decision making,  and helps us continuously improve and make progress toward our 2020 sustainability commitments.  
Our Approach Engaging with Stakeholders: An Ongoing ConversationContinuous Improvement Effective and ongoing stakeholder engagement is a core component of our business and sustainability reporting initiatives.  We recognize the value of maintaining an active dialogue with a diverse group of global partners,  including bottling partners,  consumerscustomers,  distributors,  employeesgovernment agencies,  investorsnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and nonprofit partners.  Maintaining open and constructive conversations strengthens our relationships,  helps us to understand other views and guides our decisions on what our commitments should be and how to deliver on them.  We apply our Golden Triangle partnership approach to our stakeholder engagement workspanning the public,  private and civil 
society sectors.  We recognize and embrace the idea that the collaborative power of partnerships can achieve much greater collective impact than would be possible by any one organization or sector working in isolation.  The Golden Triangle partnership approach is a core part of our business strategy,  and when managed well,  it can be a powerful tool for sustainable business growth and progress against our sustainability commitments.  We highlight examples of our Golden Triangle approach throughout our sustainability report.  In order to address pressing challenges,  The Coca-Cola Company works globally with partners to maximize environmental and societal well-being.  Globally,  our leadership is actively involved in multi-stakeholder initiatives with organizations including the United Nations Global Compact and the World Economic Forum,  among others.  As a leader in the global beverage businesswe support and collaborate with trade groups and other organizations that represent a broad spectrum of views on industry and policy.  We report on our public policy engagement activityincluding key trade association membershipsonline at Coca-Cola Journey.  We are also active in ongoing stakeholder engagements at the region and country level that meet the specific needs of the business and local communities.  The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling partners formalize engagements across our functional areas of 
operations,  including water stewardship,  human rights,  supply chain/agriculture,  women is empowerment,  well-being,  and other social and environmental areas.  Some of our engagement mechanisms and outcomes include: Our efforts to protect local water sources can only be successful if they involve collaboration with local stakeholders,  including governmentscommunity members,  water agencies,  NGOs and others.  As our bottling partners implement their source water protection plans (SWPPs)they engage local stakeholders and collaborate on solutions that serve local communities and ecosystems as well as our business.  Learn more about our featured partnerships and stakeholder engagements around water stewardship.  Dialogue with a wide range of external stakeholders is critical to respecting human and workplace rights within our system.  Continuous dialogue enables us to identify and address potential issues proactively and collaboratively.  Click here for examples of our ongoing engagement in the area of human and workplace rights.

the GRI Reporting Principles for Defining Report Content to select these issues.  Our process was: 
working together with a third-party management consulting firm,  we began with a list of 100 environmental,  social and governance topics of potential relevance.  
 From this list,  we identified the most relevant sustainability 
topics for the Coca-Cola system—reviewing a broad variety of internal and external stakeholder source documentsincluding interview transcripts,  questionnaires and surveys from direct engagement with our stakeholder groups.  The questionnaires we used were from prominent ranking organizations including DJSI,  CDP and UNGC.  We also reviewed documents that revealed the interests of our investors and the issues identified by our industry peers.  
 We held sessions to ensure that face-to-face engagement 
with diverse groups of stakeholders informed our analysisincluding through our collaboration with Ceres.  
 We aligned topics to our business and a benchmark of

 We engaged executives across The Coca-Cola Company and received feedback from Finance,  Legal,  AuditTechnical,  Chief Sustainability Office and Public Affairs & Communications,  who reviewed and vetted both the process and outcomes.  
 The results of our analyses appear on the prioritization 
matrix,  which shows the relative significance of each topic from these diverse perspectives.  
 Our highest priority topics—in the upper-right band of the

As a global system that in 2014 produced the equivalent of 687 billion 8-oz servings,  we consider the most important part of this indicator to be product safety for the end consumer.  Given that we report for the nearly 250 bottling partners across the Coca-Cola system,  we do not generate all-inclusive,  consolidated information for this metric.  However,  we applied the following methodology to assess this metric to the best of our ability: we reviewed our incident management database and identified a total of 10 matters that had a food safety aspect.  We identified 42 incidents that had some contact with regulatory authorities.  The total number of incidents that met both criteria is three.

CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT 
Active,  healthy living programs 
An active,  healthy living program is an initiative that includes one or more different forms of physical activity or education.  Examples include,  but are not limited to walking,  running,  dancing,  informal and organized sports,  or educational and/or training programs that emphasize the importance of physical activity for health and wellbeing (e.g.,  Exercise is Medicine).  The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) may support an active,  healthy living program through financial support,  volunteer hours,  providing access to physical space,  equipment and educational materials.  
Front-of-pack labeling compliance 
Front-of-pack ('FOP") calorie information must be prominently displayed in the visible area of the front of pack defined as within an area equal to 43% of the area of the 360 degree label with the product brand name as its center (unless required otherwise by national regulations).  The number of calories (or equivalent term,  such as kilocalories or kilojoules,  depending on national regulatory approach) per specified serving,  or per container,  must be provided.  TCCC is 2014 nutrition labeling policy and accompanying field implementation decisions includes the following stipulations: all Company-owned brands that have associated sales volume as reflected in TCCC is sales reporting database,  except those that are exempt or private-label products,  are required to be in compliance with the front-of-pack labeling commitment.  TCCC defines  nearly all" markets to exclude countries or markets that might be exempt from this policy due to local regulations,  imposed trade sanctions,  or political barriers.  Policy exemptions include multipurpose refillable bottles,  embossed bottles,  and products that must comply with specific product-related nutrition labeling requirements,  e.g.,  mineral water.  For refillable bottles (and for many countries bottled water),  FOP calorie labeling is being incorporated at the time new packaging is initiated,  with application beginning no later than December 1,  2016.  Newly acquired brands comply over time,  depending on acquisition agreements,  and local government product and label approval requirements.

CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT 
Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities) 
The criteria can be found in the 'Carbon Accounting Manual. " This includes scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from manufacturing and scope 3 CO2 emissions from franchises.  Direct emissions from stationary fuel consumption for warehouses and offices,  CO2 loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded.  
Lost time incident rate 
 Lost Time Incident is a work-related injury or illness,  including fatality that results in one or more Lost Days.  A Lost Day occurs when,  in the opinion of the medical professional of record,  the employee is work-related injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work.  Lost Days are counted as calendar days where counting begins the first day following the injury and ends when the person is able,  in the opinion of the medical professional of record,  to return to work,  leaves employment or reaches 180 Lost Days.  The first Lost Day is the first day following the injury,  regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday,  if the criteria for Lost Day are met.  The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) is calculated by multiplying the number of Lost Time Incidents by 200000 then dividing by the number of hours worked during the reporting period.  The LTIR approximates the rate per 100 employees and is based on Lost Time Incidents per 200000 hours worked (100 full time equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks).  Due to the chance of a minor incident developing into a Lost Time Incident over timeTCCC is LTIR was determined as of June 3,  2015 for the year ended December 31,  2014.  The scope of reporting is limited to data collected for TCCC and Company-owned or controlled facilities.  Employees include all hourly,  salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the Coca-Cola system,  as well as contractors and temporary employees who are not on a facility is payroll,  but for whom facility management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details,  means,  methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished.  The number of reported Lost Time Incidents refers to the total number of Lost Time Incidents during the reporting period.  The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees.  This excludes hours not worked,  such as vacation,  holidays,  or absences.  
Low- or no- calorie beverages 
Low- or no-calorie is defined as less than or equal to 20 kilo-calories (80 kJ) per 100ml as defined by Codex Alimentarius in the Guidelines for Use of Nutrition and Health Claims (CAC/GL 23-1997).  A beverage option is a distinct Company-owned brand beverage that is recognizable to the consumer.  A beverage option is a combination of three container dimensions: 1) container type (e.g.,  bottle,  can,  bag in box,  pouch); 2) container material (e.g.,  plasticglass,  cardboard,  pouch,  bag (powder),  etc. ); and 3) size (e.g.,  200ml,  300ml,  355ml,  600ml.  In order to be counted as offered,  a beverage option will have associated sales volume as reflected in TCCC is sales reporting database as of May 7,  2015.  
PlantBottle™ packages distributed 
PlantBottle packaging is a PET plastic bottle made partially with renewable,  plant-based materials.  Coca-Cola is first-generation PlantBottle package replaces conventional fossil-based monoethylene glycol (MEG) — one of the two primary ingredients in PET plastic — with plant-based MEG.  Up to 30% by weight of the entire PET polymer is derived from plant-based MEG.  The term distributed refers to the number of bottles sold by the Coca-Cola system to retailers.  For select groups that do not provide a calculated distributed bottle count of PlantBottle,  the metric tons of bio-PET used in the reporting cycles is used to calculate the number of bottles produced using the bottle sizes and weights.  A 5% reduction factor is then applied to the number of bottles produced to arrive at a more conservative estimate of number of bottles distributed.  
Water use ratio 
Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced.  Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola system in all global production facilities,  from all sources,  including municipal,  well,  surface water,  and collected rain water.  This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control.  This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.  Liters of product produced include all production,  not just saleable products.  
Note 1: Market is defined by the company as any country or territory that has associated sales volume during the reporting period.  Note 2: Non-financial information within sustainability reports is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data.  The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.  The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
