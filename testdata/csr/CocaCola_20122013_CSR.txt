About This Report: Toward Better Transparency in Reporting 
numerous stakeholder engagement sessions we hold across the globe every year regarding sustainability and other issues impacting our business.  This engagement plays an important role in our efforts to further enhance our sustainability reporting.  
We continue our work toward increasing transparency in sustainability reporting.  In this report,  where we can,  we report on the Coca-Cola system,  not just The Coca-Cola Company.  We believe this provides a broader view about the impacts of our business and value chain.  Our desire to concentrate our efforts on our most significant value chain impacts is also reflected in our new 2020 goals for more sustainable management of water,  energy,  and packaging use,  as well as sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients.  These goals apply to the Coca-Cola system,  rather than solely the Company.  In this report,  we continue to report progress against our 2015 goals in addition to our new 2020 commitments.  Going forwardwe will focus on our performance against our 2020 goals.  We are also working toward expanding our sustainability reporting on topics that are most important to our Company and our stakeholders.  We include an extensive discussion of potential risks and challenges to our business beginning on page 11 of our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In this report,  we have increased our discussion of stakeholder engagement,  to be more transparent on the

We strive to focus our reporting and our efforts on our most material issues,  as can be seen in our 2020 goals.  However,  we recognize that the next step in improving our reporting on material sustainability topics is to conduct and provide expanded disclosure on a more formal materiality assessment in conformance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4.  Additionally,  we are working toward continuously improving our data and data collection processes for our non-financial performance indicators.  For the first time this year,  we engaged our independent accountants,  Ernst & Young LLP,  a registered public accounting firm,  to provide external review-level assurance on the following sustainability indicators for the 2012 reporting year: water use ratio,  PlantBottle™ packaginglost time incident rate and front-of-pack labeling.  We expect to expand assurance over time.  Our sustainability report is one way we communicate progress against our sustainability goals and key performance indicators.  We also encourage you to read our Annual Report and visit Coca-Cola Journey to learn more about our sustainability efforts.

intro me we world reporting index 
We are a global business that operates on a local scale in every community where we do business.  We are able to create global reach with local focus because of the strength of the Coca-Cola system,  which comprises our Company and our more than 250 bottling partners worldwide.  The Coca-Cola system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective,  and the Company does not own or control most of our bottling partners.  While many view our Company as simply 'Coca-Cola, " our system operates through multiple local channels.  Our Company sources ingredients; manufactures and sells concentrates,  beverage bases and syrups to bottling operations; owns the brands; and is responsible for consumer brand marketing initiatives.  Our bottling partners manufacturepackage,  merchandise and distribute the final branded beverages to our customers and vending partners,  who then sell our products to consumers.  All bottling partners work closely with customers—grocery stores,  restaurants,  street vendors,  convenience stores,  movie theaters and amusement parks,  among many others— to execute localized strategies developed in partnership with our Company.  Customers then sell our products to consumers at a rate of more than 18 billion servings a day.  Learn more about this unique relationship.

intro me we world reporting index 
Dear friendsSustainability is at the heart of the Coca-Cola story.  Together with our bottling partnerswe have long worked to build stronger,  healthiermore active communities and advance environmental conservation.  Why? Because we know our business can only be as healthyvibrant and resilient as the communities we proudly serve.  For decades,  our Company—like many others—has worked to be part of society is solutions.  Coca-Cola,  for example,  was promoting physical activity in the 1930s,  varied size and packaging choices in the 1950s and anti-litter campaigns in the 1960s.  And our first diet cola,  TaB,  debuted 50 years ago.  Today,  we are advancing 21st century solutions by partnering across the golden triangle of business,  government and civil society.  We feel a special accountability—as a business that operates on a global scale—to help improve the well-being of our communities while doing what we can to responsibly steward the natural resources of the planet we all share.  For us,  this is a journey.  We are making progress as we create social value and strive to operate in ever more sustainable ways.  After all,  as we like to think about it,  we are not building The Coca-Cola Company so much for the next quarter,  but the next century.  Taking the long view has served us well.  We are calling attention to and affecting positive change on global issues that have a significant

impact on building a more sustainable and resilient value chain not only for our Companybut also the communities we proudly serve.  We at The Coca-Cola Company firmly believe there are no issues that will more shape or define the 21st century than the global empowerment of women; the management of the world is precious water resources; and the well-being of the world is growing population.  Let me share with you our progress on each of these priorities: Women: We continue advancing our 5by20 initiatives to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across our global value chain by 2020.  From fruit farmers and artisans to microdistribution center owners,  we are helping women entrepreneurs overcome the barriers they face to business success by providing them with professional training,  support networks and access to finance.  In just three years,  our 5by20 programs enabled 300000 women in more than 12 countries—more than double the number of participants in 2011.  Water: At Coca-Cola,  we understand that water is absolutely vital to our business.  As such,  we have set a goal to replenish 100 percent of the water used to make our beverages by 2020.  To date,  about 52 percent of our global product volume is estimated to be replenished through 468 community water projects around the world.  These projects take many forms,  from

rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation to safe water access and sanitation.  Our safe water efforts also include our partnership with DEKA R&D to place between 1500 and 2000 EKOCENTERs (a kiosk designed to improve the well-being of communities) or Slingshot water purification systems in 20 countries by the end of 2015.  In addition,  we are working to improve our water efficiency,  which we define as the amount of water we use per liter of product,  by 25 percent through operational advancements across our system.  This goal builds on the 214 percent improvement we have already made between 2004 and 2012.  Well-being: Our business continues to be built on a heritage of uncompromising quality— the promise that all our beverages are saferefreshing and delicious.  Today across 200plus countries and territories,  we offer the choice of more than 500 brands and 3500 beverages,  with the health and well-being of our consumers playing a large and growing role in the development of our brands.  While some of our beverages are designed for local tastes,  our well-being commitments are universal.  As we announced on May 8,  2013,  our teams are working to provide low- and no-calorie beverage options in every market; provide transparent nutrition information featuring calories on the front of all our packages; market all our beverages responsibly; and help get people moving by supporting active,  healthy living programs in every country where we do business.  As we work to double the overall size of our business over the course of this decade,  we are further embedding sustainability with our 2020 Vision for growth.  In this report—our

meets the highest standards for safety and quality.  
Since the first Coca-Cola® was served in 1886our consumers' wellbeing has been an integral part of our values and vision to provide safe,  delicious and refreshing beverages to people from all walks of life.  Today,  127 years later,  our consumers' well-being continues to drive our values and vision and it is a responsibility we take seriously.  Because in communities large and small,  we work to inspire positive opportunities for all of our consumers.  From the beverages we offer to how we label and market them to local physical activity and nutrition programs we support,  our consumers' well-being is interwoven into the fabric of our Companyboth as a responsible corporate citizen and as a community partner.  Our beverages Across more than 200 countries worldwide,  we proudly serve more than 3500 beverages that fit every lifestyle.  As the world is largest provider of sparkling beverages,  ready-to-drink (RTD) juices and juice drinks,  and RTD coffee,  we strive to meet the highest of standards in both product safety and product quality.  From rigorous product safety and quality standards to ensuring ingredient safety and quality in each of our products to driving innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences,  we work every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world.  Safety and quality in every serving Our commitment to consumer wellbeing begins with our commitment to product safety and quality.  Across the Coca-Cola bottling system,  we take great care to develop systems to help ensure that every one of our beverages 
The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
We work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and through compliance with applicable regulations and standards.  We stay current with new regulations,  industry best practices and marketplace conditions,  and engage with standardsetting and industry organizations.  Additionally,  we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies,  requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations systemwide against the same stringent standards.  Our quality management system also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement.  At every step of production,  we stringently test our beverages in modern laboratories,  where we measure quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples collected from the marketplace.  We consistently reassess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.  Measuring and meeting safety and quality standards As of 2013,  all audits measuring compliance with our product safety and quality standards are 'unannounced, " meaning personnel at our facilities are unaware when auditors will visit.  This enhancement will help ensure that manufacturing facilities across our system are in compliance with our standards and 'audit-ready" at all times.  In 2012,  our internal auditors conducted safety and quality audits at 541 of our system is more than 800 manufacturing facilities worldwide.  Helping suppliers meet safety and quality standards across our system In 2012 and 2013 we worked more closely with certain suppliers to ensure that they meet our safety and quality standards.  We focused our attention 
Me 
Well-Being 
on suppliers of certain agricultural products that we use as ingredientsincluding coffee,  tea and dairy.  By first evaluating all suppliers according to a 10-point risk model,  we determined how frequently and to what extent to audit individual suppliers.  
intro me we world reporting index 
To further ensure quality among our suppliers,  we require them to be certified as meeting Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards.  In 2012,  81 percent of our ingredient suppliers were certified according to GFSI standardsand 71 percent of our packaging suppliers were certified.  We are working to help the remainder of our suppliers achieve certification by the end of 2013.  Safety and quality by design In 2012,  dozens of product safety and quality experts from across our global system completed an 18-month process of further integrating safety and quality management across our supply chain.  Now,  by connecting the right experts within our system when a new ingredient or product is introducedand by taking a broader,  more holistic view of new products and ingredients from the outset,  we are able to identify potential risks long before production begins.  We expect this approach to further optimize safety and qualityminimize risk,  increase efficiencies and lower production costs.  The safety and quality of every ingredient Since 1886,  we have held all of our products to the highest of standards.  Wherever we operate,  we abide by the laws and regulations of local communities,  including regulations pertaining to health,  safety and product labeling.  Every ingredient we use in every product we make must meet or exceed these standards.  If we had any concerns about the ingredients we usewe simply would not use them.  
Aspartame We use aspartame to sweeten many of the 800 low- and no-calorie beverages we offer around the world and we do so with an uncompromising commitment to product safety and quality.  Aspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched food ingredients in use today,  with more than 200 studies to support its safety.  It is permitted for use in more than 100 countries,  and authorities that have approved aspartame include the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/ World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives; the European Food Safety Authority; and the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration.  For more than 25 years,  aspartame has been used to sweeten more than 6000 foods,  ranging from sparkling beverages and chewing gum to gelatins,  candies,  desserts,  yogurts and sugar-free cough drops.  
Click to see Coca-Cola is aspartame infographic.  Biotechnology We use only those ingredients that have been evaluated for safety based on evidence-based science and that have been approved for use by local health and safety regulators.  Numerous health organizationsincluding the World Health Organizationthe United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization,  the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration and the U.S.  National Academy of Sciences,  have determined that the use of biotechnology is safe.  While we acknowledge the benefits that biotechnology can provide to the environment and to address the growing pressure on the global food supply,  we also respect local communities' preferences in the sourcing of food and beverage ingredients.  
The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
Our decision on the use of biotechnology-derived ingredients in any given market depends on safetyregulatory authorizations,  types of ingredients locally available and local community preferences.  Caramel coloring We use caramel coloring in several of our products.  In fact,  we have used it in Coca-Cola beverages since 1886.  While our caramel coloring today comes from commercial manufacturers,  it is and always has been safe.  Special interest groups have claimed that caramel coloring in our cola products poses a cancer threat to consumers because it contains 4-methylimidazole,  also known as 4-MEI.  4-MEI is a byproduct that can form when many foods are heated or browned.  Food safety regulators throughout the world,  including the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration,  Health Canada and the European Food Safety Authority,  have said that the caramel we use is safe,  and that 4-MEI in caramel is not a health concern.  Caramel color meeting global specifications is permitted for use in every country where we sell our products.  In early 2012,  under the right-to-know law known as Proposition 65,  the state of California began requiring warning labels for some products containing 4-MEI above an extremely low level.  It is important to note that the state continues to allow all of these products to be sold,  including the ones that require the Proposition 65 warning.  In other words,  they are safe to use and to consume.  We disagree with the state is decision to require a warning label based on the presence of 4-MEI in certain products,  as scientific evidence does not support the state is position.  But we asked our caramel suppliers to make the necessary manufacturingprocess modifications to ensure that our caramel would be below the level set by California,  so that our products would not be required to carry a misleading warning label.  Me

As manufacturing capacity for the modified caramel becomes availablewe intend to expand its use globally.  A sweet innovation 
intro me we world reporting index 
To provide consumers with more lowand no-calorie options,  we continue to pursue the development of safeinnovative sweeteners.  Across more than 15 countries,  we offer more than 45 products sweetened in whole or in part with stevia,  a zero-calorie sweetener with origins in the chrysanthemum family.  Our newest: Coca-Cola Life™which we introduced in Argentina in June 2013.  A mid-calorie cola sweetened with sugar and steviaCoca-Cola Life is the first steviasweetened product we have introduced under the Coca-Cola brand.  Among our other stevia-sweetened products are varieties of Sprite® and three varieties of Nestea® sweetened with a combination of stevia and sugar,  introduced in France in 2012; Fanta Select™ and Sprite Select™,  both mid-calorie beverages sweetened with a blend of stevia and sugar that we began test-marketing in several U.S.  cities in 2012; and Sprite sweetened with stevia,  made available in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2013.

Driving sustainable innovation across our portfolio Our system has a tradition of innovating in many ways to offer our consumers a variety of choices.  From the soda fountain to the six packThe Coca-Cola Company has been on the front lines of innovation.  Today we use packaging innovation to provide more options to consumers,  to enable them to choose the right beverage and package size to fit their lifestyle.  Today we offer three times the number of products we offered a decade ago and more than 10 times the number we offered 20 years ago.  While we are best known for Coca-Cola,  our products include full-,  reduced-,  lowand no-calorie sparkling beverages,  still beverages,  waters,  juices,  juice drinkssports and energy drinks,  teas,  coffeesand milk- and soy-based beverages.  Packaging innovation Innovation has been a driver of our Company since its very beginning.  Today,  one way we use innovation is to provide smaller package sizes,  both in full- and low- and no-calorie beverage options.  In over 125 countries,  we offer glass-bottled sparkling beverages in serving sizes of 250 milliliters (a little

In the United States,  Australia,  CanadaSouth Korea and Thailand,  we offer 222 milliliter (75 fluid ounce) cans of Coke®,  Diet Coke®,  Coke Zero™,  Sprite®Fanta®,  Barq is™ and Seagram is™ Ginger Ale,  all containing zero to 100 calories.  And our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle™ fountain dispenser,  which we are rolling out in the United States and other markets,  offers more than 100 beverage choices,  including more than 70 low- and no-calorie options,  allowing consumers more choice.  Safety and quality in our packaging: our position on Bisphenol A Our top priority is to ensure the safety and quality of our products and packaging through rigorous standards that meet or exceed government requirements.  If we had any concerns about the safety of any product ingredient or packaging material,  we would not use it.  Some consumers have expressed concern about Bisphenol A,  or BPAwhich is used in making the lining of our metal cans.  BPA is a chemical used worldwide in making the packages of thousands of products,  including the coating inside virtually all metal food and beverage cans.  This coating guards

While we are aware of the concerns and viewpoints that have been expressed about BPA,  our point of view is that the scientific consensus on this issue is most accurately reflected in the opinions expressed by those regulatory agencies whose missions and responsibilities are to protect the public is health.  The consensus repeatedly stated among regulatory agencies in the United States,  Australia,  Canada,  Japan,  New Zealand and in Europe is that current levels of exposure to BPA through food and beverage packaging do not pose a health risk to the general population.  We will continue to take our guidance on this issue from national and international regulatory authoritiesand we will take whatever steps are necessary,  based on sound scientific principles,  to ensure that any package technology is safe for our consumers.  Meanwhile,  we continue to work closely with several suppliers who are seeking alternatives to can liners containing Bisphenol A.  Any new material,  assuming it has all necessary regulatory approvals,  also would have to meet our safety,  quality and functional requirements.  Inspiring the world to come together to help address obesity Worldwide,  people are facing a serious and complex health challenge: obesity.

walks of life to pursue solutions that help address obesity and inspire activehealthy living.    Some have suggested that sugarsweetened beverages like Coca-Cola are a primary cause of increased obesity rates.  We disagree.  There is scientific consensus that weight gain is primarily the result of an imbalance of calories—more calories consumed than expended.  People consume many different foods and beveragesso no single food or beverage alone is responsible for obesity.  When it comes to weight management,  all calories count,  including those from our caloric beverages.  We are working to provide more beverage options than ever to fit every lifestyle,  including more low- and nocalorie beverages to complement our caloric options.  In addition,  we are working to provide consumers with the facts on the calorie content in our beverages with clear calorie counts on the front of all our packages that make it easier than ever for consumers to know the calorie content of their choices.   While we provide consumers options on how many calories they choose to take in,  we are also working to inspire consumers to live active,  healthy lives by providing opportunities to expend calories through our vast support of physical activity programs.  Using a community-based model,  we have partnered with governments,  civil society and other businesses to help engage and inspire people all over the world to be healthy and happy through movement.

Two of our signature programs are EPODE International Network and Beat the Street.  EPODE International Network Large-scale,  effective prevention of overweight and obesity remains a pressing public health priority given its adverse impact on health and quality of life,  including associated risks with certain non-communicable diseases (e.g, diabetes,  cardiovascular diseases and cancer).  In view of current estimates suggesting the majority of the world is adults will be overweight or obese by 2030,  it is important that multi-sectorial efforts to reverse this trend be identified and applied.  The Ensemble Prévenons l'Obésité Des Enfants (EPODE,  'Together Let is Prevent Childhood Obesity") is a large-scale,  coordinated,  capacitybuilding network approach for communities to implement effective and sustainable strategies to address this challenge.  EPODE comprises four critical components: political commitment,  public and private partnerships,  communitybased actions and evaluation.  The multistakeholder approach promoted through the EPODE methodology has already shown encouraging results in preventing childhood obesity in France and Belgium.

A less well-known benefit of physical activitydocumented by recent research,  is that physical activity can also have a positive impact on academic performance.  These findings provide a critical impetus for society to do more to help our kids increase their activity,  especially in the school environment.  Beat the Street is a global walking The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
program for schools developed in 2011 by Intelligent Health that is designed to help communities get their children moving more.  The program encourages children to walk to school and track their walks using RFIC cards and 'Beat Box" readers located on lampposts around the school.  By touching their card to the Beat Box,  students get points for walking and assist their school and city in winning the global competition.  Beat the Street has discovered that charitable contributions and prizes for the school are powerful incentives for the students and increase participation,  so the students help improve their community as well as their health.  Coca-Cola provided seed funding in 2011 for the program is development and during 2012,  The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation supported the initial global competitionin which some 4000 children from 13 schools—including schools in Shanghai,  Vancouver,  and London

and Reading in the UK—participated.  The program helped increase the percentage of children walking to school from 63 percent to 83 percent.  Half of the students said that the program encouraged them to walk more.  The program also improved socialization among the students,  with over 90 percent of the children reporting that walking let them spend more time with their friends and one-third claiming to have made new friends by walking to or from school.  In 2013,  schools from several citiesincluding Shanghai,  Bangkok,  LondonNew York,  Vancouver,  LiverpoolSouthampton,  Bracknell and Reading,  will participate in the program.

the implementation of the World Health Organization is 2004 Global Strategy on Diet,  Physical Activity and Health (WHO is Global Strategy) and helping consumers around the world achieve balanced diets and healthy,  active lifestyles.  IFBA was formed in 2008 when CEOs from major food and beverage manufacturers—including Muhtar Kent of The Coca-Cola Company—signed a letter to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr.  Margaret Chan committing their companies to support the WHO is Global Strategy.  In the letter,  the chief executives recognized the agreement among experts that significant increases in non-communicable diseases,  such as cardiovascular disease,  hypertension and diabetes,  are linked to an increasing prevalence of obesity,  and that poor dietphysical inactivity and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle were among the causes of obesity worldwide.  The CEOs acknowledged the private sector is role in fighting obesity and pledged to take action in five areas: 1.  Continue to reformulate products and develop new products that support the goals of improving diets.  2.  Provide clear and fact-based nutrition information to all consumers.  3.  Extend our initiatives on responsible advertising and marketing to children globally.  4.  Raise awareness on balanced diets and increased levels of physical activity.  5.  Seek and promote public-private partnerships that support the WHO is Global Strategy.  Our global commitments to help address obesity are aligned with the five commitments of IFBA.  In August 2013IFBA published its fourth annual report outlining progress made against these five commitments.  Read the report here.

Marketing Responsibly We recognize the power of marketing and the importance of doing so responsibly.  As one of our global commitments to help address obesity,  we have reaffirmed our long-held policy of not marketing to children.  We are committed to not marketing to children younger than 12 anywhere in the world because we believe parents and caregivers are in the best position to make decisions about what children eat and drink.  Read more about our Responsible Marketing Policy.  Under our policy,  we do not directly target children younger than 12 in our marketing messages,  and we do not advertise during programming specifically targeted to children.  We do not buy advertising directly targeted at audiences whose makeup is more than 35 percent children younger than 12.  And our advertising does not show images of children drinking our products unless the children are shown with a parent or caregiver.  Our policy applies to all of our beverages and to all of the media outlets we use,  including television,  radio,  print and,  where data are available,  Internet and mobile phones.  In 2010,  we began implementing our Global School Beverage Guidelines.  We recognize and respect the unique learning environment in schools and believe in commercial-free classrooms for children.  So we have committed not to commercially advertise or offer our beverages in primary schools unless

To help make sure we and other beverage companies are meeting standards for marketing to childrenan independent third party conducts audits of our advertising to children annually.  A 2012 analysis by Accenture Media Management (Accenture)commissioned by the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA)showed a high rate of compliance in our industry generally.  The study,  which looked at the practices of our Company and nine others in a total of seven markets around the world,  showed that industry compliance in print and online advertising was 100 percentmaintaining levels measured in 2011— while industry compliance in television advertising improved to 989 percent from 976 percent in 2011.  The audience threshold used in Accenture is study was more than 50 percent children younger than 12.  Consistent with our Company policy,  IFBA is global policy on advertising and marketing communications to children has been strengthened to cover more television programming: the policy now applies to audiences made up of 35 percent or more of children younger than 12.  Third-party compliance monitoring like Accenture is will now measure against the 35 percent threshold.  A similar study for the International Council of Beverages Associations,  which focused on The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc.,  showed 991 percent compliance in television advertising in 2012,  compared to 955 percent in 2011 and 957 percent in 2010,  and 100 percent compliance in print and online advertising,  a consistent figure since 2010.

We expect the 5by20 initiative to continue to grow in 2014 and beyond.  As the initiative gains momentum,  we are learning that it takes time to develop scalable,  sustainable empowerment programs that are deeply relevant to local women and their communities.  So we are taking great care in collaborating with our partners to develop programs.  We continue to test programs and to explore how to best localize,  optimize and scale the most successful of them.  We believe this customized approach is the best way to ensure lasting empowerment among the women we are engaging.  Training and support for small-scale mango farmers 
 To have a sustainable model with the most potential for scale,  initiatives should develop locally and,  as noted in the report,  be 'in line with local business priorities,  capabilities and resources. "  It is important to be nuanced about the idea of partnership.  'There are many different kinds of partners and partnerships,  and all can be fit-forpurpose, " note the study is authors'depending on how that purpose aligns with the incentives and institutional capacities of the partners involved.

Looking ahead: challenges and opportunities 
To help improve the livelihoods of smallscale fruit farmers—many of whom are women—we launched Project Nurture and Haiti Hope,  two projects that are already providing a measure of independence and economic empowerment for female farmers in Kenya,  Uganda and Haiti.  By the end of 2012,  nearly 40000 farmers—14000 of whom were women—had received training in quality specifications,  logistics and negotiation of prices.  Project Nurture also provides assistance with agronomy and postharvest handling.  We

We are also helping to improve the livelihoods of mango farmers in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.  To date,  about 300 female farmers have received training through Project Unnatian initiative that encourages farmers to adopt drip irrigation and a method of farming called ultra-high-density plantation practice,  which allows mango orchards to reach their full fruit-bearing potential in three to four years rather than the seven to nine years needed by conventional farming.  The practice also makes it possible for farmers to plant as many as 600 trees per acre,  dramatically increasing yields.  Conventional farming methods allow for about 40 trees per acre.  Project Unnati has the potential to double mango yields and improve the livelihoods of more than 50000 farmers.

Growing sales and small businesses with MDCs Our MDC program has contributed to the growth of our business and the growth of local economies in Africa and Asia for more than a decade.  It helped inspire and inform the 5by20 initiative and is one of the key ways we are economically empowering entrepreneurs worldwide.  MDCs are product distribution centers managed by local people in developing countries.  The centers help us do business in hardto-reach communities; in exchange,  our local bottlers offer ongoing coaching and mentoring to MDC owners.  MDCs contribute substantially to our efforts to economically empower women.  In Africa,  where 3400 MDCs employ more than 19000 peoplemore than 800 MDCs are owned and managed by women.  Since 2009,  more than half of new MDCs have been owned and operated by women; in Nigeria and Ghana,  women own more than 70 percent of all MDCs.  Our bottlers' use of micro distribution continues to grow.  In countries such as Kenya,  Tanzania,  Uganda,  Ethiopia and Mozambique,  MDCs account for the majority of sales.  In China,  our 
Market Execution Partners model,  which operates on principles similar to those of MDCs,  has grown significantly over the last three years.  We see opportunities to expand the MDC model to other developing countries in Asia and Africa.  A leading NGO recognizes our women is programs

Human and Workplace Rights An essential ingredient in every one of our products is our profound commitment to human rights and workplace rights.  Respecting human and workplace rights is fundamental to our culture and imperative for a sustainable business.  In our Company and across the Coca-Cola system,  we are working to make sure all people are treated with dignity and respect.  Our work in this area is overseen by the Public Issues and Diversity Review Committee of our Board of Directors.  We consider human and workplace rights—as articulated in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization is Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work—to be inviolable.  We take a proactive approach to respecting these rights in every workplace of The Coca-Cola Company,  in our bottling system,  in our supply chain and in the communities in which we operate.  The foundation of our approach lies in four key documents: our Human Rights Statement; our Workplace Rights Policy; our Supplier Guiding Principles; and our Global Mutual Respect Policy,  which we introduced in 2012.  All four documents are consistent with the United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organization (ILO) declarations.  Together,  they describe our high standards and expectationsaddressing such subjects as freedom of association,  forced labor,  child labor The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
discrimination,  hours of work,  safetyworkplace security,  and community and stakeholder engagement.  Our Human Rights Statement,  our Workplace Rights Policy and our Global Mutual Respect Policy apply to all entities in which The Coca-Cola Company owns a majority interest.  Many of our larger bottling partners have their own human rights policies.  For several years,  we have undertaken the complex work of ensuring that our entire business system and supply chain align with our policies.  We expect our Company,  our bottling partners and our suppliers to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts as a result of business actions and to address such impacts when they occur.  Furthermore,  our Companybottling partners and suppliers are also responsible for preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts directly linked to their operations,  products or services by their business relationships.  To meet these expectations,  our Company,  bottling partners and suppliers are adopting processes for identifying,  preventing and mitigating negative impacts on human rights.  Additionally,  all are required to implement a process for remediation of any adverse human rights impacts they cause or contribute to.  Our efforts to promote respect for human rights across the Coca-Cola system and throughout our supply chain are being recognized.  In 2011,  Calvert Investments,  Inc.,  announced that we met its 'environmental,  social and governance criteria as a result of clear progress in labor and human rights. " For more information,  read Calvert is analysis of our progress.  Checklists and good practices: implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights In 2011,  the UN Human Rights Council adopted the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles),  which provide guidance for We 
Human and Workplace Rights 
addressing the risk of adverse impacts on human rights linked to business activity.  We formally endorsed those principles after working for several years with Professor John Ruggie,  the former UN Special Representative for Business and Human Rights.  His 'Protect,  Respect and Remedy" framework for respecting human rights in a business contextalong with the UN Guiding Principles,  is now among our primary touchstones as we develop our own programs and practices.  
intro me we world reporting index 
According to the UN Guiding Principlesany company implementing respect for human rights in a corporate context must put three primary components into place:  A policy commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights  A due diligence process to identifyprevent,  mitigate and be accountable for human rights abuses  Processes to enable the remediation of any adverse human rights impacts the company causes or to which it contributes We are implementing all three of these components in our Company and are working with our bottling partners and suppliers to help them implement the UN Guiding Principles as well.  We continually analyze potential and actual human rights impacts across our value chain,  from raw materials to end use.  We identify human rights risks,  along with policies and actions for mitigating them.  In addition,  we have developed five human rights–related due diligence checklists for managers across our Company.  These easy-to-use two-page checklists cover such topics as migrant labor,  child labor,  plant siting and more.  They offer clear steps our managers can take immediately—not only to comply with our policies but also to integrate an ongoing and reflexive respect for human and workplace rights that is inseparable from our daily operations.  
For our bottlers and suppliers,  we have identified '26 Good Practices" that we encourage them to adopt.  Like the checklists we use in our own Companythese practices enable bottlers and suppliers to move beyond legal compliance to the integrated,  systematic and sustained respect for human rights and workplace rights envisioned in the UN Guiding Principles.  Our support of the UN Guiding Principles builds on our work as a participant in the UN Global Compact and member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (and its predecessor,  the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights).  Our work in those partnerships continues.  The Coca-Cola Company is perspective on implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights has been featured by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre,  as well.  
from employees in our Companydown from 426 in 2011.  The largest numbers of complaints were related to discrimination (which includes retaliation and harassment) and work hours and wages.  We found no instances where freedom of association had been denied.  In cases where claims are substantiated,  we take corrective action.  Depending on the violation,  corrective action may take the form of back payreassignment of duties and in severe cases,  separation from the Company.  
To help our Company,  our bottling partners,  and our direct suppliers achieve compliance with our policies and principles,  third-party auditors trained in our standards conduct regular workplace assessments.  We conduct annual assessments of new suppliers and suppliers with a history of noncompliance.  For suppliers with a history of compliance,  we conduct assessments every three years.  More than 15000 workplace assessments have been completed since 2003.  
Aligning our system and suppliers 
In 2009,  we set a goal of ensuring that 98 percent of our Company-owned and managed facilities meet our workplace rights standards by 2015.  We met that goal in 2011 and maintained a 98 percent compliance rate once again in 2012.  
Goal: By 2015,  achieve a 98 percent compliance level for Company-owned and managed facilities upholding the standards set in our Workplace Rights Policy.  Also,  achieve 90 percent compliance with our Supplier Guiding Principles among independent franchise bottling partners and suppliers.  
Investigating rights-related complaints We require all associates of The Coca-Cola Company to know our human rights and workplace rights standards and to apply them in their work.  Managers,  in particular,  receive intensive training.  We also rely on our associates to speak up immediately if they believe our policies have been violated.  Associates can report perceived violations confidentially and without fear of retaliation through numerous channels,  including our EthicsLine—a global Internet and telephone information and reporting service for associates,  customerssuppliers and consumers who perceive violations of our Code of Business Conduct,  our Workplace Rights Policyour Global Mutual Respect Policy,  our Human Rights Statement or applicable laws and regulations.  We treat all inquiries confidentially and investigate all concerns.  
Progress: As of December 31,  2012:  98 percent of our Companyowned facilities had achieved compliance.  We met our goal of 98 percent compliance in 2011.   77 percent of our bottling partners and 80 percent of our direct suppliers had achieved compliance.

As for our suppliers and bottling partners,  we expect them to comply with the higher standards of international norms and applicable laws with respect to workplace and human rights principles.  We encourage them to adopt our Human Rights Statement and Workplace Rights Policy or equivalents; to comply with our Supplier Guiding Principles; and to uphold the standards we have set for everyone doing business with us.  We convey our expectations and offer compliance assistance through our Supplier Guiding Principles program.

Addressing human and workplace rights in Myanmar In 2012,  we announced our plans to do business in Myanmar for the first time in more than 60 years.  In 2013,  we began production at two bottling plants in the country—the beginning of $200 million in investments planned over the next five years that we estimate will create more than 22000 job opportunities.  Through our presence,  we hope to contribute to Myanmar is economic and social success in addition to growing our business.  Our goal is to have 90 percent of our bottling partners and suppliers comply with our Supplier Guiding Principles by 2015.  We are making steady progress.  By the end of 2012,  77 percent of bottlers and 80 percent of direct suppliers had met the standards of our Supplier Guiding Principles.  These represent a 9-point and 7-point increaserespectively,  in compliance over 2011.  Reaching deeper into our supply chain One of our ongoing challenges is ensuring respect for human rights and workplace rights far 'upstream" in our supply chain,  among our second- and third-tier suppliers and beyond.  Such suppliers can number in the tens of thousands,  and their operations are often not transparent to us.  What is more,  some of our suppliers,  lacking stakeholder engagement and oversight from government and advocacy groupshave had little incentive to formalize policies and practices related to human and workplace rights.  To begin to integrate respect for human rights and protection of workplace rights across our supply chain,  we began piloting a program called Pass It Back in 2012.  The aim of the program is to share our knowledge and best practices related to human and workplace rights with key suppliers and then work with them to 'pass it back" across their supply chains,  sharing what they have learned with their own suppliers.  Our ultimate aim is to build respect for human rights and 
The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
protection of workplace rights so that they stretch unbroken from our system back to the farm,  the forest or wherever the points of origin of our raw materials may be.  Working initially with a fruit supplier,  a carbon dioxide supplier and a supplier of paper products—who collectively represent more than $1 billion in procurement spending—we conducted an analysis of each business is human rights impacts and policies.  We found that all three companies generally lacked policies and awareness in regard to their potential impacts on human and workplace rights.  We also found that all three were enthusiastic about making improvements and sharing them across the extent of their own supply chain.  We are now working closely with the companies as they develop their policies and build their capabilities.  The process can be slow,  but we believe our approach will ultimately result in greater respect for and protection of human and workplace rights across our supply chain.  Meanwhile,  we are considering how to expand Pass It Back to include other suppliers.  We recognize that some supply chains may be too complex for the program.  In those cases,  certification—as under the Bonsucro Standard for sugar— may be a more effective tool for ensuring that our suppliers align with our policies and values.

Prior to re-entering Myanmar,  we conducted the most comprehensive due diligence process in our recent history.  It included,  among many other aspectsextensive local stakeholder engagement and a thorough review of human rights issues in the bottling plants we acquiredin the local supply chain and throughout the country as a whole.  Our human rights assessment,  conducted in October 2012drew upon reports from the U.S.  State Department,  work from the Institute for Human Rights and Business,  and from contracted reports by UL (Underwriters Laboratories Inc. ),  a global safety science company.  A team including Coca-Cola personnel and representatives from UL also conducted an in-person Supplier Guiding Principles assessment of our two bottling plants,  spending nearly 450 hours over two weeks surveying the communities bordering the plants as well as two independent distributors.  The bottling plants we audited scored in the bottom quarter of audited bottlers and suppliers worldwide.  Our assessments revealed issues common in developing economies,  including genderand age-based discrimination,  hours of work and wage issues,  and health and safety concerns.  But rights violations we expected based on our initial researchsuch as child labor,  were not found.  Audits of a sample of local distribution centers revealed similar issues.  Following the audit,  we worked with plant managers to implement a remediation plan.  The plan includes detailed steps for corrective action to 
be taken in the near,  medium and long term,  including continual development of the plants' and distributors' capacity for aligning with our policies and guidelines.  We will conduct semiannual follow-up assessments until all areas of noncompliance are corrected and annually thereafter until compliance is sustained.  At that point,  the sites will be placed on our normal assessment schedule of every one to three yearsdepending on compliance performance.  In addition to remediation work at the site level,  we are partnering with local organizations and collaborating with other companies to deliver training on our workplace standards.  We will sponsor the training,  which will be delivered by the British Council in conjunction with the ILO.  The trainings will bring together a broad array of supply chain partners.  By working with other companies,  we hope to establish the implementation of human and workplace rights safeguards as standard industry practice in Myanmar.  In April 2013,  we conducted follow-up audits of our two Myanmar plantswhich showed that about 24 percent of the identified issues had been addressed.  (Of 33 issues identified,  eight had been fully addressed.  Additional issues also had been addressedbut the plants have not yet achieved full compliance in those areas. ) We recognize that changing some aspects of workplace culture in Myanmar will require a great deal of time,  persistence and collaboration.  We are optimistic and enthusiastic about the positive contribution we can make to the country is capacity for respecting and protecting human and workplace rights.  As part of the lifting of U.S.  sanctions against Myanmar for human rights violations,  and in conjunction with the authorization of new licenses permitting investment in the countrythe U.S.  State Department required investing companies in Myanmar to report annually,  beginning in 2013,  on their human rights due diligence.  Our

The report will also include an overview of the significant steps we are taking to mitigate corruption risk in our Myanmar operations,  including steps within the supply chain and distribution of Company products.  Confronting the 'hard issues": our sixth annual human rights conference In May 2013,  we hosted our sixth human rights conference at our corporate headquarters in Atlanta,  convening more than 150 leaders from businessesgovernment and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to discuss the role of businesses in respecting human rights.  The conference was aimed at giving attendees a better understanding of how to help their companies implement the UN Guiding Principles and mitigate human rights impacts.  The conference addressed a variety of difficult issues facing businesses as they implement the UN Guiding Principles in their businesses and their supply chains.  Discussions focused on human trafficking,  conflict minerals,  doing business in Myanmar and more.  Helping to eradicate child labor in sugarcane fields Our Human Rights StatementWorkplace Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles prohibit the use of child labor.  While there is no child labor in our Company-owned operations,  we are aware that child labor persists on some of the farms that grow cane for our sugar suppliers,  driven by poverty and local social norms.  Our Company does not typically purchase ingredients directly from farms,  nor are we owners of sugar farms or plantations,  but as a major buyer of sugar,  we are taking action and using our influence to help end child labor in sugarcane fields.  Our approach is both global and local.  At the global level,  we set corporate policy,  convene experts,  and engage 
We

with governments,  NGOs and other companies.  At the same time,  we collaborate with suppliers,  industry groups and local stakeholders to address the issue with farmers.  In recent years,  we have joined collaborative efforts in El Salvador that have dramatically reduced child labor in cane fields.  We are also taking action in Bolivia,  the Dominican RepublicHonduras,  Mexico,  the Philippines and 14 other countries.

Most recently,  we collaborated with ILO-IPEC (International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour) to design and distribute a training guide discouraging the use of child labor among sugar farmers in Mexico while encouraging more efficient farming practices.  We also facilitated ILO-IPEC is access to several farms supplying two of our authorized sugar refineries,  enabling ILO-IPEC staff to conduct appropriate interventions to address child labor.  In addition,  we collaborated with our bottler in Bolivia to encourage our major sugar supplier to address hazardous child labor issues and improve the overall labor conditions in its sugar supply chain.  This work was done in collaboration with Hagamos Equipo.  In 2013,  we completed our second round of funding to Save the Children Honduras to raise community awareness and support the Honduran sugar industry is continued efforts to reduce hazardous child labor.  Preventing human trafficking Our Company proactively addresses human trafficking and forced labor in our Human Rights StatementWorkplace Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles.  These policies are supported by independent assessments of supplier,  bottler and Companyowned facilities that are conducted by third parties to verify compliance with our standards that prohibit human trafficking and slavery in supply chains.  
In February 2012,  we hosted a conference on human trafficking in labor sourcing,  which was attended by nearly 150 business leaders,  human rights experts,  investors,  NGOs,  legal experts and others.  The conference focused on exploring solutions to eliminate human trafficking in labor sourcing.  In January 2013 in Atlanta,  we sponsored a panel discussion on human trafficking that was moderated by former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin.  In May,  in conjunction with our human rights conference,  we hosted a one-day multi-stakeholder meeting on human trafficking sponsored by the Institute for Human Rights and Business and Humanity United to address two key contributors to human trafficking: holding of passports and payment of recruiting fees.  We also are a founding member of the Global Business Coalition Against Human Trafficking,  a group of global corporations that recognize the critical role business can play in ending human trafficking and all forms of modern-day slavery.  Collaborating with labor We respect the rights of workers in the Coca-Cola system to join unions without fear of retaliation and to engage in collective bargaining without interference or fear of retaliation.  More than 30 percent of workers in the Coca-Cola system are represented by trade unions.  Of those,  more than 70 percent are affiliated with the International Union of Food,  AgriculturalHotel,  Restaurant,  Catering,  Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF)one of our business system is most important stakeholders.  Maintaining a productive relationship with trade unions enables us to collaborate with them on key issues affecting our Company is success.  It also enables us to solve problems positively and constructively and manage risk.  Twice each year,  we meet with IUF delegates from around the world at our Atlanta headquarters to discuss labor and workplace issues in our system.  
The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
These meetings enable us to have frank conversations and address and resolve difficult issues across the table through serious and practical engagement from both sides.  We encourage our bottling partners to collaborate with labor organizations as well.  In addition to our work with IUF,  we also have ongoing and regular engagement with a wide variety of human rights groups and socially responsible investors.  Ensuring ethical engagement of contract labor Our Company and bottling partnerslike many businesses,  employ contract and agency labor.  There are many legitimate uses of contract labor,  and we expect contract workers,  through thirdparty providers,  to continue to play an important role in our business.  Through enhancements to our Supplier Guiding Principles assessments,  our Company is holding more contract and agency labor suppliers accountable for the ethical treatment of these workers.  Our Supplier Guiding Principles also informed our new Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles to ensure fair labor practices and the respect of human and workplace rights on farms in our supply chain.  Our commitment to human and workplace rights,  as well as our commitment to operating a sustainable business,  compels us to respect the rights of all workers,  including those not directly employed by our Company or bottling partners.  So,  we are working with our business units and our bottling partners to develop a proactive,  holistic approach to managing contract labor that protects workers and our Company by addressing critical issues at each phase of a contract worker is engagement with us—from our initial decision to use contract labor through the end of the relationship with labor suppliers or specific workers.  We expect our personnel and our bottling partners to understand the risks associated with contract labor and to carefully manage the labor agencies engaged.  
We 
Human and Workplace Rights 
We also expect them to provide training and a safe work environment and to avoid using termination practices that circumvent legal obligations.  We take a number of steps to ensure responsible engagement of the contract and agency workers we employincluding the following: 
intro me we world reporting index 
 We stand by our commitments and expectations for the treatment of all workers as described in our Human Rights Statement,  Workplace Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles.  Any allegation of worker abuse—including abuse of contract laborers—is a very serious issue that we fully investigate.   We conduct continuous assessments of our operations and of key authorized contract labor suppliers to ensure the responsible treatment of contract laborers.   We engage with key stakeholders to understand their perspective regarding potential abuse of contract workers.  The subject of contract and agency labor is a standing agenda item for our semiannual meetings with the IUF.  Through these meetings,  we have successfully addressed a number of concerns regarding contract workers in India,  Pakistan and the Philippines.   We provide our largest bottling partners with contract labor riskmitigation checklists and other tools to help them manage contract labor appropriately.  In 2012,  we developed a contract labor 'gap analysis" tool and a contract labor human rights due diligence checklist for our Company and our bottlers.  The checklist enables a quick self-assessment.  The gap analysis tool enables bottling partners and business units to conduct a deeper assessment of their current contract labor practices compared to generally accepted good practices and to quickly see their potential risk.  Both the tool and the checklist are part of 
our proactive,  holistic approach to addressing each phase of a contract worker is engagement with us,  from our initial decision to use contract labor through the end of our relationship with a contract worker.  Collaborating to increase sustainable sourcing We are a leading member of AIMPROGRESS,  a forum of 37 fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers and suppliers working together to promote responsible sourcing practices.  vAIMPROGRESS conducts in-person and virtual supplier training sessions around the world as part of the organization is joint training initiative.  Training covers the four major pillars of responsible sourcing: human rights

and labor standards,  health and safetyenvironmental compliance and business integrity.  Leaders from participating companies provide perspective on why responsible sourcing is important to customers,  stakeholders and sustainable businesses.  Over the last two years the sessions have reached approximately 2000 suppliers and 4000 people.  Member companies recognize supplier audits completed on behalf of another company through a framework called mutual recognition.  Recognizing audits conducted on behalf of another company reduces audit fatigue,  saves time and lowers costs on the part of suppliers and shifts the focus from auditing to performance.  Our work 
We

with AIM-PROGRESS has advanced our mutual audit recognition to 16 percent of the suppliers we audit.  Building capabilities for respecting human and workplace rights 
intro me we world reporting index 
To help increase human and workplace rights–related capabilities among our employees,  our Company has organized a series of development sessions and training programs.  More than 20 of these training resources are available online via Coca-Cola University.  Training programs include Workplace Rights Policy and Human Rights Statement Manager Training; Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights; Business Case for Human Rights; Workplace Rights Policy Employee Familiarization; and many others.  
Implementing our Global Mutual Respect Policy In December 2012,  on Human Rights Day (December 10),  we introduced our Global Mutual Respect Policy.  The policy focuses on how the Company expects employees to treat each other and everyone they interact with in their work on behalf of the Company.  The policy specifically addresses:  Valuing diversity and inclusion  Creating an environment free from discrimination and harassment  Reporting potential discriminationharassment or any other type of disrespectful or excessive behavior

Continuing our commitment to workplace safety Every worker has a fundamental right to a safe and healthy workplace.  Our Workplace Rights Policy requires that we take responsibility for maintaining a productive workplace in every part of our Company by minimizing the risk of accidents,  injury and exposure to health hazards for all of our associates and contractors.  We are working to help our bottling partners minimize such risks for their employees and contract workers as well.  The Coca-Cola Operating Requirements (KORE) define the policies,  standards and requirements for managing safetythe environment and quality throughout our operations.  KORE also requires that our manufacturing and distribution facilities implement BS OHSAS 18001 (British Standard Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 18001,  a framework for an effective occupational health and safety management system) or an equivalent internationally recognized safety management system.  To guide us in achieving a safe work environment for our associates,  KORE defines a rigorous set of operational controls to manage known risks.  The controls generally align with top global requirements and consensus standards.  In addition,  we engage recognized external audit firms to assess the compliance of each of our manufacturing operations with applicable laws and regulations and our Company occupational safety and health requirements.  We provide substantial safety training to our associates using the training requirements defined in KORE as a global baseline.  Training covers newhire induction and periodic refresher training for all associates and other workers conducting work on our behalf.  
In 2012 and 2013,  we launched or enhanced several platforms to increase safety capabilities across our system,  including:  A 'Safety and Environment Successful Solutions" portal,  which provides a common online location where safety leaders can create and share successful safety practices from across the system.

 A monthly online training series geared especially toward safety and environmental professionals and available to all Coca-Cola system associates.  Our safety record in 2012 Despite improvements in 10 of the 17 countries where we have Companyowned bottling facilities,  our overall lost-time incident rate increased 5 percent between 2011 and 2012—from 22 to 23.  This increase was driven primarily by improved reporting of onsite contractors and ancillary operations in Europe.  In addition,  we regret to report the deaths of five Company associates and 10 contractors in 2012.  Vehiclerelated incidents in India,  China and the Philippines accounted for all but two of those deaths.  The remaining two deaths were due to falls from height—one in the United States and one in India.  We continue to educate workers on fleet safety,  contractor safety and fall protection.  We also have work under way to further enhance our response to serious safety incidents.  
Chain Council,  ensuring integration and alignment with operations at a higher level than ever before.  The Global Safety Council includes senior safety leaders from within our Company and from our bottling partners and works to support our system vision of creating and maintaining a 'zeroincident" culture.  The Global Safety Council is working to develop the safety capabilities of our leadership,  ensure robust safety-management processesalign and enhance our metrics systems and advance behavior-based safety programs.  We also improved results reviews at the Operating Committee level and aboveensuring the necessary leadership focus on safety improvement.  
Ongoing focus on route-to-market safety Improving safety in our manufacturing facilities is just part of our work.  A significant portion of the risks to our employees and contractors can be found outside the walls of our plants— in distribution centers,  on the road and when delivering our products to our customers.  Further improvement in these areas will take time,  but we took some significant steps in 2012 and 2013,  including:  Designating a dedicated corporate 'Route-to-Market Safety and Environment Principal" to engage our system in creating and implementing our improvement strategy.   Increasing system resources,  including the addition of a new fleet safety manager for our Company-owned bottler in India.  Focus on India is a priority based both on the number of safety incidents in that country as well as the high reliance on contractors for distribution and route sales there.  
Working to improve safety systemwide In 2012 and 2013,  we took a number of steps to improve safety in our Company and across our system.  The senior leaders of our three operating businesses—Coca-Cola AmericasCoca-Cola International and Bottling Investments Group—designated themselves as senior executive sponsors for safety and health and will engage our system leadership in efforts to raise standards and performance on safety systemwide.  Also,  we incorporated our Global Safety Council within our Global Supply The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

In addition,  our bottlers and business units led local initiatives.  One example of such an initiative is Coca-Cola Iberia is comprehensive safety program,  which was launched in 2013 and intended to reduce accidents not only in its own fleet but also among distributors and third parties distributing Coca-Cola products in Spain and Portugal.  Greater adoption of behavior-based safety programs Like many companies,  we are expanding our focus on behavior-based safety in order to continually increase the level of employee engagement in the safety improvement process.  Organizations throughout our system have the flexibility to evaluate and implement locally relevant programsand early results are encouraging.  As an example,  since implementing its behavior-based program in 2010,  our French concentrate production facilityCoca-Cola Midi S. A. S.,  has reduced its lost-time incident rate by 78 percentits medical treatment cases rate by 83 percent and its lost-time incident severity rate by 93 percent.  Looking ahead: raising the bar Our work to improve safety systemwide will accelerate in 2014.  The improvements we are preparing to implement include:  Improvement of safety audits.  We will create an 'always audit-ready" culture by conducting only unannounced safety audits.  Frequency of audits will vary by facility based on risk.  We will also shift from contracted auditors to an in-house auditing team.   Enhanced capability and development systems for Quality,  Safety and Environment personnel.  We will implement more robust methods of ensuring our talent pipeline is in place and will improve our capability assessment tools.   Continued focus on fleet safety and other priority areas.  We will create focused networks to more effectively tap the expertise of existing safety resources throughout our Company and across our system.  The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

In late 2012,  we announced the establishment of our Multicultural Leadership Council,  a panel of U.S, based employees working together to accelerate leadership opportunities within our Company for multicultural associates.  While we have long focused on the hiring,  development and advancement of multicultural associates,  our Multicultural Leadership Council will bring additional momentum and employee insight to those efforts.  
In 2010,  our Company acquired the North American business of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  and formed Coca-Cola Refreshments USA,  Inc.  (CCR),  as a wholly owned subsidiary.  Since then,  we have helped CCR implement programs for ensuring the same leadership in diversity,  inclusion and fairness that have characterized our Company for more than a decade.  Among other measureswe helped CCR establish eight new Diversity and Inclusion Councils,  which help drive diversity policy.  CCR continues to further embed diversity and inclusion in its human resources processes.

Water Stewardship Inside every bottle of Coca-Cola is the story of a company that understands the priceless value of water,  respects it as the most precious of shared global resources and works vigorously to conserve water worldwide.  We can't imagine treating water any other way.  Clean,  accessible water is essential to the health of communities.  It is critical to ecosystems and indispensable for economic prosperity.  And it is essential for our business.  Water is the main ingredient in our beverages,  central to our manufacturing process and necessary for growing the agricultural products we use as ingredients.  
Though we share concern about water sources and increasing water stress in many parts of the world,  we believe the world contains enough water to meet everyone is needs—but only if everyone works together to better manage water resources.  As a consumer of water and as a company with a presence that is both global and local,  we have a particular obligation—and a unique opportunity—to be a responsible steward of water.  
Our global system is working to replenish,  or balance,  the water used in our finished beverages—an estimated 52 percent so far,  with an ultimate goal of being water-neutral by 2020. * Our system is becoming more efficient in its water use by reducing the amount used per liter of product,  even as production volumes increase.  And Coca-Cola bottling plants around the world are recycling wastewater,  treating it to stringent standards and returning it to nature at a level that supports aquatic > 
$260MM invested in community water projects to date with our partners 
Collaborating to replenish the water we use Goal: By 2020,  safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production.  
We have a particular interest in protecting the water sources that sustain communities because the communities that host our bottling plants are also our consumer base; we sell our products where we make them.  If those communities stay strong,  our business will stay strong; if the watersheds we share with them are conserved,  those communities,  and our business,  can thrive.  So,  in addition to the ethical and ecological imperatives that drive our water stewardship,  we also have a vested business interest in conserving and improving local water sources.

Progress: In progress.  We estimate we have balanced 52 percent* (811 billion liters) of the water used in our finished beverages (based on 2012 production volume) and returned approximately 160 billion liters through treated wastewater.  Between 2005 and the end of 2012,  we balanced an estimated 52 percent of the water used in our finished beverages based on 2012 production volume,  for an estimated total of 811 billion liters of water replenished to communities and nature. * We are working toward water balance through diverse,  locally-focused community water projects that often grow out of the source water vulnerability assessments (SVAs) conducted by our bottling plants.

In many cases,  projects also help improve local livelihoods,  help communities adapt to climate changeimprove water quality and enhance biodiversity.  Since 2005,  we have engaged in 468 projects with partners such as World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  United States Agency for International Development (USAID),  The Nature Conservancy,  Water for People,  United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  To date,  our initiatives for improving water access and sanitation alone are estimated to have benefited more than 182 million people.  Our bottling partners' SVAs and source water protection plans (SWPPs) provide opportunities to link our replenish actions to watersheds and communities where we operate.  For example,  the SVA for one bottling plant identified rising nutrient concentrations in the local watershed,  which provided both source water for our manufacturing plant and an important eco-tourism attraction and recreational amenity for the local community.  Through the SVA and SWPP processes,  we were able to raise concern over water quality,  rally the local government and community,  and encourage area farmers to implement farming practices that reduced the The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
nutrient load on the watershed.  We are increasingly pursuing synergies between our source-water protection and replenish programs so that we can identify and implement locally relevant projects that support the increased sustainability of local watersheds and communities while reducing risks to our business.  How we quantify replenishment: an evolving methodology The Nature Conservancy,  with support from LimnoTech and the Global Environment & Technology Foundationhelps us calculate the volume of water we have replenished using an approach based on widely accepted tools and methodologies.  While we believe these methods are sound,  we acknowledge that the science and methodology shaping quantification of water replenishment are new and developing.  It may be premature to rely on our water benefit calculations as hard fact.  For more about how we quantify replenishment,  read our report,  Quantifying Replenish Benefits in Community Water Partnership Projects.

Bringing RAIN to Africa In 2009,  The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation launched the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN),  a $30 million program that is on track to provide at least 2 million people across Africa with safe water by 2015 and to fund water projects in every African country.  RAIN-funded projects improve sanitation and hygiene,  increase productive use of water and protect watersheds.  To dateRAIN has provided access to safe water for approximately 800000 people in 33 of Africa is 58 nations.  It has helped replenish more than 13 billion liters of water and improve 1600 communities.  Because the lack of water and sanitation facilities in African nations is particularly hard on the continent is girls and women,  we have focused much of the investment in RAIN to date on water and sanitation partnerships aimed at improving the lives of an estimated 400000 girls and women across Africa.

Many of our community water projects,  while strategically aligned with our business system is water stewardship strategy,  are funded through our Coca-Cola Foundation and our foundations worldwide.  Read about some of them in the Charitable Giving section of our Sustainability Report.  Additionally,  information about specific water stewardship work at bottling plants and communities across our system can be found in reports issued by our bottling partners.  The challenge of sustaining water balance While we are energized by our success to date,  we recognize that we have much more to do if we are to meet our goal of replenishing the water we use by 2020.  And meeting that goal is only a first step.  We also intend to continue to balance the water we use over time—a complex and neverending challenge.  Sustaining water balance will require us to continue to treat all process wastewater,  even as our business grows and as government regulation of treatment becomes stricter in some parts of the world.  In order to sustain this commitment,  we will need to replenish more water to balance our water use as our business grows.  And it will require us to sustain the outcomes of our community water projects through monitoring and evaluation,  to ensure that those projects continue to deliver the intended benefits to people and nature.  
intro Corporate Water Stewardship,  exploring me the utility and practical application of we the water footprint methodology for world understanding our water use throughout reporting the value chain,  and for identifying the index impacts of that use and associated response actions.  Water footprint studies were conducted related to the following Company products and ingredients:  Coca-Cola® in a 05 liter PET bottle produced in the Netherlands;  Beet sugar supplied to Coca-Cola Europe is bottling plants; and  Orange juice produced for the North American market.  
Setting a new goal for water efficiency Goal: By 2020,  improve water efficiency in manufacturing operations by 25 percent compared with a 2010 baseline.  Progress: We have improved our water efficiency 59 percent since 2010 and 214 percent since 2004.  We have made steady progress in improving our water efficiency,  which we define as the amount of water we use per liter of product.  Between 2004 and 2011,  we met our initial goal of improving water efficiency system-wide by 20 percent compared to a 2004 baseline.  Our new goal is to improve efficiency by 25 percent over our 2010 water use ratio of 226 liters of water used per liter of product produced.

Understanding our water footprint Water footprinting—an approach to assess the total volume of water used to produce a product—is helping us extend our view of how we use water across our supply chain.  Our studies have shown that around 80 percent of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural supply chain.  As a founding partner of the Water Footprint Network,  we have worked with WWF,  Conservation International and others to assess the water embedded in our product ingredients so we can better understand the implications for our business,  and work to reduce impacts.  In collaboration with The Nature Conservancy,  in 2010,  we issued a report,  Product Water Footprint Assessments: Practical Application in 
World 
Water 
The largest portion of the product water footprints assessed as part of these studies came from the fieldnot the factory,  which demonstrated significant opportunity to engage more directly with our agricultural suppliers in advancing more sustainable water use.  Guided in part by these assessmentsto date,  we have focused studies on the 'blue, " green" and 'grey" water footprints of sugar beets,  orange juice and Coca-Cola® to help us pinpoint potential sustainability impacts in specific watersheds.  We expect to increasingly assess not just the quantity of the water used to grow our product ingredientsbut the impact of that use as well.  Understanding impact is importantbecause large water footprints can be sustainable in water-rich areaswhile very small water footprints might compromise sustainability in places where water is scarce.  Gaining a clear understanding of impacts makes good environmental sense and provides us with better guidance for prioritizing areas of concern.  Coca-Cola Europe has proposed a methodology for water footprint sustainability assessments that considers impacts as well as water quantity.  Also,  please refer to the Sustainable Agriculture section of our Sustainability Report for more details on our efforts with suppliers.

By the end of 2012,  788 of the 863 bottling plants in our system (91%) had completed source vulnerability assessments and 587 plants had begun implementation of source water protection plans.  Work on this goal began in 2008.  Due to challenges in obtaining data,  ongoing discussions with stakeholders and the sheer volume of work requiredsome plants have not yet met our goal.  We aim for all plants to have source water protection programs in place by the end of 2013.  
 A review of available water quality data and known current and historical water quality issues.   A 'conceptual hydrologic model" for the watershed and groundwater basin.  Models include a water balance calculation and account for inputs such as rain and outputs such as withdrawals and evaporation.  
To mitigate water-related risks to our system and to the communities we serve,  we have required every one of our system is 863 bottling plants to conduct a local source vulnerability assessment,  or SVA.  We also require a water source sustainability assessment as part of the due diligence process when we acquire land for a new plant or purchase a business with existing manufacturing plants.  These assessments inventory the socialenvironmental and political risks to the water sources supplying our facilities and the surrounding communities.  SVAs include the following elements,  among others: 
 A water scarcity evaluation that identifies current water stress and drought conditions.   An evaluation of the potential for natural disasters and security issues to threaten the facility is source water.   An evaluation of how the facility is water use could limit the availability and quality of water for people in the local community.  
 An assessment of the facility is wastewater treatment system and its effectiveness in removing known and suspected contaminants,  along with an assessment of the potential impact our wastewater discharge could have on the surrounding ecosystem and community.

The SVAs performed to date show that water quality is a ubiquitous concern in communities where we do business.  Water scarcity,  increasing competition for water and infrastructure reliability have also been commonly cited.  In some locations,  policy,  economic and social risks can be more challenging to assess.  And lack of watershed data is a common barrier to completing robust technical assessments.  SVAs sometimes deliver good news: We have seen that in some communitiespublic sector water managers are investing in risk-mitigation planning and water sustainability resiliency,  indicating risks that are lower than we estimated prior to assessment.  From assessment to action Once bottling plants have completed their SVAs,  we require them to develop and implement a comprehensive SWPP detailing specific risk-mitigation actions and deadlines for completing them.

the watershed level,  from hydrological vulnerabilities to local water management,  and often are the basis for community water projects aimed at protecting and improving water sources.  Because many issues identified in an SVA are concerns shared among many if not all water users in a given watershed,  we use our findings to engage governmentslocal communities,  businesses and civil society,  and plan for collaborative action.  We required that our Company-owned bottling facilities and independent bottling partners conduct SVAs for each bottling plant location,  and develop SWPPs by the end of 2012.  We confirm compliance with this requirement through a formal governance process.  As of the end of 2012,  approximately 91 percent—788 plants of 863—had completed SVAs and developed SWPPs.  Nearly 70 percent of our global manufacturing system — 587 of 863 plants — have begun implementation of SWPPs with the balance to begin implementation in 2013.  Though work on this goal began in 2008 and good progress has been made to date,  challenges in obtaining dataongoing discussions with stakeholders and the sheer volume of work required have impeded the progress of some plants in our system.  Of the plants that did not meet our deadline,  many are in the final stages of completion.  Through our governance processes,  our system is senior leaders are working with plants to implement corrective action plans and bring them into alignment with our goal.  Governance ensures not only that assessments and planning are conducted,  but also that SWPPs are implemented.  As more plants in our system move from assessment and planning to implementation of their plans,  we will detail their progress in future reports.  
Treating and recycling wastewater Goal: By the end of 2010,  return to the environment—at a level that supports aquatic life—the water we use in our system operations through comprehensive wastewater treatment.  Progress: In progress.  We aspire to treat all wastewater from our manufacturing processes.  As of the end of 2012,  we had achieved 98 percent alignment with our wastewater treatment standards.  We reduce our impact on water systems and contribute to improved water quality by treating wastewater before returning it to the environment.  Our stringent treatment process ensures that the wastewater we discharge meets,  and in many cases exceeds,  standards set by local regulations.  (In some countrieswe have introduced the very first wastewater treatment facility. ) In 2012our system released approximately 160 billion liters of treated wastewater.  In 2006,  we set the goal that,  by the end of 2010,  all water used in our system operations would be discharged at a level that supports aquatic life.  We identified that level through a three-part process:

 Working with experts from outside our system,  we evaluated aquatic toxicology science to determine how varying concentrations of certain water quality parameters (acidity,  alkalinitybiological oxygen demand,  etc. ) affect aquatic life.   We reviewed wastewater regulations from around the world to see how governments were addressing those same parameters.  
Our system has invested $1B+ over the last decade in our wastewater treatment initiatives 
 We identified what was in our wastewater by analyzing several samples of untreated wastewater from different operations across our system.

Our internal wastewater treatment standards call for all water we discharge to be treated to those levels.  To date,  99 percent of our Companyowned plants are compliant with our wastewater treatment standards and either fully treat wastewater on site or use a municipal or governmentapproved wastewater treatment plant with secondary treatment.  Our plant in Lachine,  Quebec,  Canada,  is working to upgrade their wastewater management system by early 2014.  As we expectedthough,  aligning an entire system spanning more than 200 countries and territories has proved to be challenging.  Delays in financing,  government permitting and construction have slowed this process,  as have war and civil unrest in countries such as Yemen and Syria.  As a result,  we have not yet met our goal of 100 percent alignment.  At the end of 2012,  98 percent,  or all but 17 of the 863 Coca-Cola related bottling plants,  had achieved alignment.  Though much depends on variables beyond our control,  we are working closely with our bottling partners and are hopeful that 16 of the 17 noncompliant plants will achieve compliance with our standards by early 2014.  The 17th noncompliant plant is in Syria.  Compliance efforts there will resume when that country is security issues have stabilized.  Our position: the human right to water and sanitation In 2010,  the United Nations (U. N. ) General Assembly passed a nonbinding resolution by majority vote to officially recognize the human right to water and sanitation and declared that clean drinking water and sanitation are 'essential to the realization of all human rights. " The U.

At Coca-Cola,  we respect the human and ecological needs for water.  We also are engaged in internal and external discussions about what it means in practice to respect the human right to water and sanitation.  Through our Water Resource Sustainability programwe have implemented a rights-based approach to water in requiring our operations to assess vulnerabilities to community sources of water,  determine potential impacts from our use of water and discharge of wastewater,  and then address issues in a SWPP.  As a participant in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC),  we are one of a number of businesses committed to aligning our operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights,  laborenvironment and anti-corruption.

Already,  many of our water projects are helping communities mitigate and adapt to the impacts associated with the intersections of water,  energy and food.  For example,  some projects increase the ability of watersheds to absorb threats associated with increasingly severe weather events and help build resilience in response to the higher demands for water,  energy and food.  Others focus on increasing crop yields to meet the needs of a growing population while reducing the impacts on water sources through water body alterations,  aquifer The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

" —Muhtar Kent Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer The Coca-Cola Company While improving and protecting water sources is critical,  we believe the most effective way to achieve long-term water security for communities and our business is by setting sound water policy at the national level for each country.  We are working to improve water policy in several countries around the world as a founding member of the 2030 WRG.  Created in 2007 by businesses and governmental organizations,  2030 WRG is a neutral,  public-private platform housed within the International Finance Corporation (IFC).  At the invitation of governments,  2030 WRG helps water officials accelerate reforms aimed at promoting more sustainable water resource management for the long-term development and economic growth of their countries.  2030 WRG helps countries first diagnose gaps in their water supplies,  and then develop and test solutions.  We are supporting 2030 WRG with an investment of $2 million

Stakeholder engagement and the social license for water use Our stake in local water sources is just one of many.  For us to do business— and to be part of the solutions addressing water stress—it is essential for us to secure the trust and goodwill of the people in the communities where we operate.  Such trust can only come from candid,  continual dialogue—an ongoing conversation in which we show residents how much water we are using,  how we are using it,  and what we are doing to improve water sourceswhile carefully listening and seeking to understand residents' specific concerns about water.  If they are to be effective,  our efforts to protect local water sources must involve collaboration with local stakeholdersincluding governments,  community members,  water agencies,  NGOs

In 2012,  we used the Ceres Aqua Gauge™,  a methodology and tool that assesses corporate water management.  Based on both internal and external information,  a full assessment of our water strategy was conducted against leading practices to identify strengths and areas for improvement and formulate recommendations.  An increased focus on our engagement with customers on water stewardship and water stewardship within our supply chain were key areas for improvement.  As we work to reset our sustainability goals in 2013,  the Aqua Gauge assessment is helping inform new commitments.  In 2009,  we worked with The Environmental Law Institute to produce A Guide to Stakeholder Engagement for Improved Water Stewardship.  The guide is intended to help our bottling partners identify stakeholders,  facilitate the engagement process,  prioritize issuesunderstand regulatory requirementsand forge productive partnershipsamong other objectives.  The guide also provides a suite of tools for stakeholder engagement and promotes stakeholder engagement according to five core principles: transparency,  inclusivenessrepresentivity,  accountability and respect.

We define 'water neutral" as the point where we are returning the water we use back to communities by treating all wastewater and returning it to the environment at a level of purity that supports aquatic life and replenishing an amount of water equivalent to our product volume through locally-relevant water projects.  
Sustainable Packaging 
consumers but also are efficiently produced and readily recovered or recycled.  
Packaging plays an essential role for our business in meeting consumer needs and preventing waste by protecting our products during delivery.  In factinside every one of our bottles—and in our cans and other packages,  too— is the story of a company trying to make its packaging more environmentally and economically sustainable.  We work to deliver the quality beverages our consumers expect in the most efficient way possible,  with a key focus on recyclabilityminimizing resources and increasing the use of recycled and renewable materials.  Additionally,  we support programs that encourage consumers to recycle used beverage packaging.  Approximately 85 percent of our unit case volume is delivered in recyclable bottles and cans,  and because the majority of our packaging is fully recyclable,  we are working to maintain and grow this percentage.  As we do sowe consider environmental concerns along with our need to protect the safety and quality of our products and to transport them efficiently.  We also take into account the different preferences of consumers around the world.  
By taking into account all aspects of packaging development,  from raw materials and development to transport and recovery,  we are able to mitigate risks in production that could both erode our profitability and negatively impact our brand equity.  Such risks include cost fluctuations or supply chain disruption of packaging materials such as petroleum or aluminum and also potentially being viewed as a contributor to global pollution—even though a significant percentage of our packages are recovered and recycled.  All in allour strategic approach to developing more-sustainable packaging enables us to meet the needs of our consumers and reduce our business risk along with our impact on the environment.  Beyond our own cans and bottles: an ambitious new recovery goal Our beverage containers are recovered through industry-financed collection organizations,  through communitybased and government programs and through our system directly.  They are also recovered by informal collectors.  We are working to increase recovery rates across all of these channels.  In 2012,  we helped to recover 371 million pounds of aluminum and PET plastic containers in the United States and Canada alone.  
In 2009,  we set the goal of recovering bottles and cans equivalent to 50 percent of those that we send to market annually.  While we have made solid progress toward that goal through our longtime support of community recycling programs,  precise measurement of recovery rates has been hampered by a lack of available data.  Many communities,  especially in developing and emerging markets,  do not collect recovery data.  Also,  there is no practical mechanism for tracking the collection of packaging by the millions of informal collectors that operate in every market in which we distribute our products.  Based on available data we estimate that,  to date,  we are recovering 39 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans that we send to market.  
intro me we world reporting index 
In July 2013,  to improve recovery trackingand to raise the bar for our system and for communities worldwide,  we announced our new goal of achieving a 75 percent recovery rate for the number of bottles and cans equivalent to what we introduce in developed markets by 2020.  Currently,  the recovery rate in developed markets is estimated at 50 percent.  While that rate is moving in the right directionit is not enough,  we believe,  to achieve our goal of improved environmental and economic sustainability.  
Working to make our packaging more sustainable is more than just the right thing to do,  it is smart business.  We work to employ sustainable packaging innovations that not only delight

market and enable us to better set targets for improved recovery rates.  We are working to have the RTM rolled out in all markets by the end of 2013.  
We are working toward recovery of 75 percent of all bottles and cans in these markets: Australia Austria Belgium Bulgaria Canada Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Great Britain Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy 
Japan Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Netherlands New Zealand Northern Ireland Norway Portugal Slovakia Slovenia South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan United States 
Moving all of our developed markets toward a 75 percent recovery rate will require an enormous effort from everyone: businesses,  governmentsnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and,  of course,  consumers.  We intend to provide leadership that helps bring all sectors of society together to advance progress.  We know a 75 percent recovery rate is attainable in developed markets,  based on markets like Japan and Belgium that have already achieved or exceeded it.  
We will work with multiple recovery channels,  including municipal recycling programs,  industry recovery efforts and our own direct recovery initiatives.  To meet our new goal,  we will work in 36 developed markets to increase recovery and recycling rates.  We are also working with other companies and with local organizations worldwide to identify and compile independently verified recovery and recycling data so that we can establish authoritative baseline information on current recovery rates.  We intend to help improve recovery rates in developing markets as well.  We are working to first establish solid baseline information,  a more challenging task in developing marketsbefore setting a global goal.  We will set that goal by 2015.  In select markets in Latin America,  the Asia Pacific region,  Eurasia and Africawe are piloting our new Recovery Tracking Methodology,  or RTM.  Our RTM involves locating credible sources of recovery data in each market and then assigning one of three quality levels to each data set.  We expect our new methodology to substantially improve data validation,  increase our baseline understanding of recycling in each The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
As we progress toward our new 2020 goal,  we are as committed as ever to achieving our original goal of recovering bottles and cans equivalent to 50 percent of those that we introduce into the marketplace annually by 2015.  Supporting community-based programs worldwide Goal: By 2015,  recover 50 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans used annually.  Progress: In progress.  We estimate that 39 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans we send to market are recovered.  To promote recycling and increase recovery rates,  the Coca-Cola system also supports numerous litter prevention programs and community organizations,  including through The Coca-Cola Foundation.  Following are some of the programs and organizations we support: Happy Recycling Machine.  Coca-Cola Singapore brought together government,  civil society and a very special vending machine to help increase recycling rates across the country.  When consumers placed their empty plastic beverage bottles in the machine,  they received an award for being environmentally responsible.  The campaign collected 51827 World

recycled bottles while educating the public on the importance of supporting environmental sustainability.  Keep America Beautiful.  We helped found the nonprofit organization Keep America Beautiful 60 years ago,  and our support continues.  A grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to Keep America Beautiful allowed 25000 single-stream curbside recycling carts to be donated to the city of Chicago.  The grant was matched by a commitment from The Coca-Cola Company to provide an additional 25000 carts over the next five years.  The carts will be part of the city is overall deployment to 600000 households,  which is expected to significantly raise recycling rates in the Windy City.

Project Recover.  Project Recoveran initiative supported by The Coca-Cola Company that involves local government and nonprofit organizations in Thailand,  helps create cooperative communities centered on the recovery and recycling of beverage packages.  The project provides job opportunities for members of the local community,  as they are able to collect recyclable materials and turn them in to the cooperative for payment.  Reimagine Beverage Containers.  Coca-Cola Recycling,  a part of our Company is North America Group,  is working with Envipco to pilot Reimagine Beverage Containers recycling centerswhich provide interactive collection kiosks to encourage recycling.  More than 13 million containers have been recycled since the Reimagine pilot program launched in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in late 2010.  On average,  each week more than 1500 consumers bring their cans and PET plastic bottles to the recycling center,  and more than 1 million cans and bottles are recycled each month.  Read more about our support of community recycling programs around the world in the Charitable Giving section of this report.  
Inspiring more consumers to recycle Millions of consumers worldwide have adopted the recycling habit.  Still,  many of our plastic bottles and one-third of our cans are not recycled.  To help increase recycling rates,  we are working to invent creative ways to engage with consumers.  Following are just some of our efforts from 2012 and 2013.  EKOCYCLE.  In July 2012,  we launched the EKOCYCLE™ program,  a collaboration with musical artist and producer will, i, am and other consumer brands.  EKOCYCLE is a stand-alone brand initiative dedicated to helping encourage recycling and sustainability among consumers through the marketing of lifestyle products made in part from recycled material.  The EKOCYCLE initiative aims to educate consumers about everyday recycling choices and empower their decisions to purchase products made in part from recycled products.  EKOCYCLE educates consumers about waste that can be repurposed into recycled content for fashionable and valuable lifestyle products.  It also encourages demand for recycled materials and reinforces the importance of recycling.  Watch a video about EKOCYCLE.  Happiness Recycled.  Collaborating with Zero Waste Scotland,  we connected with more than 18000 people and got our message out to 160000 more through promotions at four events in France and Great Britain during the summer of 2013.  Using fun,  interactive recycling bins designed by animators—and cheering on recyclers with a pompon squad—we encouraged showgoers to recycle their bottles and cans.  Then we gave them souvenir photos and temporary tattoos to remind them to recycle after the event.  Using social media during and after,  we spread the word well beyond the show is groundsinspiring consumers through TwitterFacebook and more.  The promotion was more than just a good time: In a postevent survey,  22 percent of those we connected with said they were recycling The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

As a Worldwide Partner of the Olympic Movement and the longest continuous sponsor of the Games,  we wanted to help make the London 2012 Olympic Games the most sustainable Games of modern times.  As part of that effortwe helped implement a 'zero waste infrastructure, " including waste and recycling bins designed and positioned to maximize recovery rates.  We also reached beyond the Olympic venues to place 260 new recycling bins around London.  The bins on Oxford Street alone now collect over 1 metric ton of recyclable waste each day.  In addition,  our bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises collaborated with waste reprocessor eCO Plastics to fast-track plans for a major new bottle-to-bottle recycling facility in Lincolnshire,  England.  This £15 million investment more than doubled the amount of bottle-grade recycled plastic (rPET) available in Great Britain and enabled us to commit to recycling all clear PET bottles from Games venues and turn them back into new bottles within six weeks.  We also sought to inspire more people to recycle during the 70-day Olympic Torch Relay around the UK with a distinctive 'Recycle to the Beat" hybrid vehicle to make recycling more fun.  All of the approximately 15 million PET plastic bottles we collected throughout the Games were reprocessed and back on the shelves of British retailers within six weeks.

Continued collaboration in reducing marine debris When used packaging is not disposed of properly,  it too often ends up littering the world is waterways.

In 2011,  working with Ocean Conservancy,  we helped launch the Trash Free Seas Alliance,  a group of diverse businesses,  NGOs,  scientific institutions and community groups that share the common goal of eliminating ocean trash.  By bringing these groups together,  we hope to speed restoration of the world is seas.  In 2013,  we worked with the Trash Free Seas Alliance to host knowledge-sharing sessions that highlighted the threat of marine debris,  including a presentation from Conservation International on the Ocean Health Index.  We have also partnered with Ocean Conservancy for the past 18 years as a sponsor of the International Coastal Cleanup,  the world is largest volunteer effort for ocean health.  Each year,  Coca-Cola system associates are among the more than 500000 volunteers who help clean up the world is waterways during the event.  Using more recycled and renewable materials Goal: Source 25 percent of our PET plastic from recycled or renewable material by 2015.  Progress: In progress.  Five percent of our packaging materials currently comes from recycled or renewable materials.  Approximately 60 percent of our total beverage volume is sold in plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate,  better known as PET plastic.  Driving demand for PET plastic is a consumer preference for packaging that is lighter in weight,  shatter-resistantresealable and easily recyclable.  In addition,  PET plastic enables us to 
improve resource efficiency while maintaining our commitment to exceptional beverage quality.   In 2009,  we set a goal of sourcing 25 percent of our PET plastic for bottles from recycled and renewable materials by 2015.  In 2009,  to help meet that goal,  we introduced our breakthrough PlantBottleTM packaging program.  PlantBottle packaging is helping to make PET packaging more sustainable by making the bottle with up to 30 percent of plant-based material.  Continuing with our commitment to rPET In the early 1990s,  we became the first company to use food-grade recycled PET plastic—known as rPET—in packaging.  Our enabling of rPET-related research began decades before that.  We recognized early that creating end markets for recycled PET plastic would be critical to our bottle recovery efforts and to the success of PET plastic as packaging material.  Today,  we are still working to increase the amount of rPET in our packaging.  But we have encountered challenges.  Over the last decade,  demand for rPET has increased significantly; demand for rPET fiber,  used to make clothing and other non-food products,  is particularly high.  And while increased demand is a positive development for the rPET market,  greater demand has also driven up prices and reduced supply.  In addition,  food-grade rPET requires more processing and commands a premium over non-food-grade rPET,  making it even more of a challenge for us to costeffectively incorporate more rPET in our packages.  Our strategy? To help increase recycling and recovery of PET bottles (and thus increase the supply of rPET) while developing innovations like PlantBottle,  which requires fewer nonrenewable ingredients than conventional PET plastic.  Meanwhilewe remain committed to using rPET in our packaging,  as it makes sense economically.  Our system has invested The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report 
in six bottle-to-bottle facilities that improve our capacity for using rPET.  In the United States,  we recently worked with rPET suppliers to reach agreement on more favorable terms for rPET stock.  Additionally,  we continue to invest in the exploration of technologies and recovery systems that could enable more efficient and cost-effective production of food-grade rPET.  And because the use of rPET is approved in just a limited number of countries,  we are working with governments of the nations where we do business to remove legal barriers to the use of recycled materials in beverage packaging.  Bringing PlantBottle to scale Because innovative technology is most meaningful when it is widely adoptedwe have worked steadily toward our goal of using PlantBottle for all of our PET packaging by 2020.  At the end of 2012,  we had distributed more than 14 billion PlantBottle packages in 24 countries.  In 2012,  we expanded PlantBottle packaging into such countries as Serbia,  South Korea and India.  In existing PlantBottle markets like the United States,  Canada,  Mexico and Brazil,  we expanded the number of brands using PlantBottle packaging.  We distributed approximately 7 billion PlantBottle packages during the calendar year ending December 31,  2012.  Approximately 6 percent of the total new PET plastic used by The Coca-Cola Company contains our first-generation PlantBottle packaging material.  We remain focused on building out our supply chain to meet our goal of PlantBottle packaging comprising 100 percent of the new PET plastic we use by 2020.   We expect our use of PlantBottle packaging to be a key contributor to achievement of our goal to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions embedded in the 'drink in your hand" by 25 percent by 2020.  Already,  our use of PlantBottle packaging has eliminated the need for the equivalent of more than 300000 barrels of oil

and helped to save the equivalent emissions of approximately 130000 metric tons of CO2—the amount of CO2 emitted annually from more than 27000 passenger vehicles.

Advancing innovation through increased adoption of PlantBottle packaging To accelerate supplier interest and investment in PlantBottle packagingwe are enabling other companies to have access to the technology.  In 2011,  we entered into a partnership with H. J.  Heinz Company to put its ketchup in PlantBottle packaging.  So far,  more than 164 million bottles of Heinz ketchup in PlantBottle packages have been distributed throughout North America.  We will continue to explore the potential for similar partnerships.    Building a foundation of trust Transparent environmental and social performance measures,  developed in collaboration with credible partnersare at the foundation of our PlantBottle packaging program.  Because PlantBottle packaging is made from sugarcane waste,  sustainable cultivation and harvesting of sugarcane are among our chief concerns.  Issues such as water consumption,  land use,  impacts on biodiversity and child labor are all pertinent.  Because such concerns are rarely addressed by typical packaging lifecycle assessment tools,  we have built on our Company is existing sustainable agriculture program and engaged with partners such as World Wildlife Fund to help advance our understanding of how to identify and select sustainably sourced feedstocks.  We have also worked to ensure that the program does not adversely affect local food security.  And we are investing in research to advance technologies that use agricultural residues or wastes to help us continue to grow PlantBottle packaging more sustainably.  Toward the bottle of the future Currently,  up to 30 percent of the material used in PlantBottle packaging comes from plants (in some markets 62 
the plant-based content may be less where we also include recycled content in the bottle).  We are limited to 30 percent because,  currently,  commercial technologies only exist for making one of the two ingredients in PET plastic.  Our ultimate goal is to develop PET plastic that is 100 percent plant based.  In 2011,  we announced multimillion dollar investments in three innovation companies that have technology solutions for replacing the other ingredient in PET plastic and can help turn our 100 percent vision into reality in the coming years.    To further drive progress,  we created a plant-PET technology collaborative in 2012.  Our fellow members of the collaborative are Ford Motor CompanyH. J.  Heinz Company,  Nike,  Inc.,  and The Procter & Gamble Company.  By leveraging the combined efforts of these companies in ways that are consistent with applicable antitrust/competition law rules,  the collaborative is hoping to speed development of a completely plant-based PET material.  Read more,  or watch a video,  about PlantBottle packaging,  what it is made of and much more.  Achieving greater efficiency through lightweighting 
To date we have:  Trimmed the weight of our 20-ounce PET plastic bottle by more than 25 percent  Shaved 30 percent from the weight of our 12-ounce aluminum can  Lightened our 8-ounce glass bottle by more than 50 percent Lightweighting is often a market-bymarket effort.  For example,  our bottling partner in Puerto Rico has developed a 500-milliliter bottle for DASANI® water that weighs 98 grams—the lightest bottle in our system.  We are working to top that by developing an 8-gram bottle that we hope to introduce globally in 2014.  Smarter packaging for a smaller carbon footprint 
Goal: By 2015,  improve packaging material efficiency per liter of product sold by 7 percent compared with a 2008 baseline.  
In July 2013,  we announced our 2020 goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the 'drink in your hand" by 25 percent.  Packaging is the largest contributor to our carbon emissions,  making up 38 percent of our CO2 as of 2010,  our baseline year for our new goal.  Our system is efforts to design more efficient packagingemploy more renewable material and increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging is expected to make a significant contribution toward reducing our carbon footprint.  
Progress: On track.  Between 2008 and 2012,  we improved packaging material efficiency per liter of product sold by 7 percent for at least 85 percent of our packaging volume.  We intend to maintain or improve upon that level between now and our target year of 2015.

Our concern is based on the scientific consensus that global climate change is occurring and that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are a contributing factor.  The implications of climate change on our planet are profound and wideranging.  Public health,  agriculturebiodiversity and water sources may all be negatively affected.  The potential effects on people,  communities and ecosystems are sobering to consider and demand immediate action.  Of course,  climate change also poses risks to our business as well.  More frequent and intense droughts and floods can harm global agriculturelimiting the supply or increasing the cost of ingredients we use in our products.  Extreme weather could impair our bottling plants,  disrupt our supply chain and affect consumer demand.  Perhaps most seriously,  climate change could significantly limit water resources for our operations,  for our supply chain and for the communities we serve.  Our system generates greenhouse gas emissions by consuming energy through manufacturing,  by consuming fuel in our global delivery fleet and by chilling our products for optimum refreshment.  Our broader supply chain,  which includes the manufacturing of our packaging and the farming that grows our ingredientsgenerates millions of additional tons of greenhouse gases.

An ambitious new goal for reducing carbon in our value chain Goal: Reduce the carbon footprint of 'the drink in your hand" by 25 percent by 2020.  Progress: New.  We are working to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain of our products by making comprehensive reductions across our manufacturing processespackaging formats,  delivery fleetrefrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing.  In July 2013,  we joined our longtime partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in announcing a number of new environmental goals.  Among them: a commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our beverages by 25 percent by 2020.  This new goal complements our existing goals for 2015.  Our new goal stems from the recognition that to make a meaningful difference,  we must reduce emissions generated by not only our bottling plants and distribution fleet but also our entire value chain,  including agriculturepackaging,  and refrigeration.  An initial analysis showed that,  in our baseline year of 2010,  our value chain emitted approximately 59 million metric tons of greenhouse gases,  and only about 52 million metric tons came from manufacturing.  We estimate that achieving our new goal will enable us to prevent more than 20 million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2020.  That is four times our system is annual carbon emissions from manufacturing,  and the equivalent of taking 38 million cars off the road for a year.

This new goal is ambitious and is among the most progressive climaterelated commitments from any company.  To ensure that we succeedwe will collaborate with our partners and suppliers and continue to move forward with energy-efficiency and climate-protection initiatives already under way across our system.  This work includes:  Continuing to improve the sustainability of our packaging through design optimization and the increased use of recycled and renewable materials such as PlantBottle™ packaging  Improving the energy efficiency of our cooling equipment  Committing to more sustainable sourcing of key ingredients  Incorporating more fuel-efficient modes of product delivery  Improving energy efficiency within our manufacturing operations  Phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in all new cold-drink equipment  Increasing our use of clean energy To help us reach our new goal,  we are developing annual reduction targets for the next seven years and working with our supplier partners to find ways of meeting them.  We are also developing processes for measuring progress.  And we are equipping 'climate ambassadors" who will champion our goal systemwide and provide training

A 3 percent increase in manufacturing emissions in 2012 Goal: Grow our business but not our systemwide carbon emissions from manufacturing operations through 2015 compared with a 2004 baseline.  Progress: Off Track.  Our global manufacturing emissions in 2012 were 12 million metric tons lower than the business-as-usual forecast for 2012.  However,  total (absolute) emissions were 3 percent higher than emissions from 2011,  and now stand 15 percent higher than our 2004 baseline.  In 2008,  we set the goal of growing our business but not our systemwide carbon emissions from manufacturing operations through 2015.  Our manufacturing sites emitted 548 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2012,  a 3 percent increase over 2011.  That number puts us 15 percent higher than our 2004 baseline and off track for reaching our goal of bringing emissions levels back down to that baseline by 2015.  We consider this upward trend to be both disappointing and unacceptable.  We are working diligently to reduce emissions through a variety of measures,  including expanded use of clean energy.

Though our manufacturing-related emissions increased in 2012,  our emissions intensity—the ratio of emissions to production volume—improved by nearly 2 percent over 2011.  In all,  our emissions intensity has improved 19 percent since 2004.  Even with our year-over-year increase in emissions in 2012,  our emissions are still 12 million metric tons lower than 'business as usual" forecasts for the year.  We have successfully slowed growth in emissions relative to volume; now we are aiming to stop andultimately,  reverse it.

Emissions in developed countries down 8 percent since 2004 Goal: By 2015,  reduce emissions from our manufacturing operations in developed countries by 5 percent compared to our 2004 baseline.  Progress: On track.  In 2012emissions from our manufacturing operations in developed countries were 8 percent below our 2004 baseline.  In 2012,  our emissions from manufacturing operations in developed countries increased slightly—about 2 percent—compared to 2011.  Even somanufacturing-related emissions in developed countries are approximately 8 percent lower than our 2004 baselinekeeping us well on track toward our goal of a 5 percent reduction by 2015.  We are bringing emissions down in part through our continuing work with bottlers on the 'Top 10 Energy-Saving Challenge. " The program,  developed with WWF and launched in 2011,  equips bottlers and plant managers with 10 high-return,  low-risk energy-saving practices they can readily implement.  Each practice delivers high financial return and contributes significantly toward achieving our climate targets.

In September 2012,  the United States Environmental Protection Agency recognized Coca-Cola Refreshments USA,  Inc.,  the Company is bottling and customer service organization for North America,  with a Green Power Leadership Award for its agreement to generate energy from a 65-megawatt combined heat-and-power system at an Atlanta facility.  This cogeneration plant captures methane gas from a nearby landfill and converts it to clean-burning fuel.  The plant generates at least 48 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually,  resulting in an emissions reduction of approximately 20000 metric tons of CO2 per year,  equivalent to the CO2 emissions from the electricity use of more than 4000 average-sized homes per year.

technology staff are working to limit CO2 emissions from powering our corporate data centers even as the load on our computer servers increases.  In 2013we completed an upgrade of 30 air handlers in one of our data centers.  We expect this improvement to reduce our CO2 emissions by an estimated 650 metric tons annually—the equivalent of taking 90 cars off the road.  As we make steady progress toward our goal for developed countries,  we are also working hard to reduce emissions in developing countries.  One example: Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Private Limited (HCCBPL),  our largest bottling partner in India,  has committed to expand the amount of energy it draws from renewable sources to 40 percent by 2020.  HCCBPL will attempt to achieve that goal by exploring the use of a solar rooftop as well as wind- and biomassgenerated power at several of their bottling plants.  World

Complementing efficiency efforts in manufacturing,  we have also improved the energy efficiency of our cold-drink equipment worldwide by more than 40 percent compared to year 2000 levels.  We have deployed nearly 55 million energy management devices (EMDs) for cold-drink equipmentreducing average energy consumption by an estimated 5 billion kilowatt-hours per year and delivering corresponding annual emissions reductions of approximately 31 million metric tons— equivalent to the electricity used by over 464000 homes.  Energy-efficient colddrink equipment saves our customers money,  too—an estimated $440 million per year.  
In 2012,  to help our manufacturing facilities continue to improve energy efficiency,  we developed 20 step-by-step guidelines to implementing energysaving actions and shared them with our bottlers.  We also upgraded our internal website dedicated to strategies for saving energy,  and our system held more than 20 workshops on increasing energy efficiency.  Improving packaging to reduce our carbon footprint Packaging is the largest contributor to our potential carbon emissions,  making up 38 percent of our CO2 emissions as of 2010.

So in addition to conventional fuels,  we are powering our fleet with a mix of efficient alternative fuels,  including electricity,  natural gasdiesel-electric and biodiesel.  In North America,  we operate a hybrid electric fleet of more than 750 trucks that use about 30 percent less fuel than conventional diesels—the largest such fleet on the continent.  For our presence at the London 2012 Olympic Games,  we deployed 14 delivery vehicles powered by landfill gas.  Our system is trucking fleet,  which includes trucks operated by our Company and our bottling partnersaccounted for about 8 percent of our emissions in 2012.  Our fleet emitted 46 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2012—a 14 percent increase from our 403 million metric tons of fleet emissions in 2011.  
Pushing forward with HFC-free cooling equipment Goal: As of 2015,  all new cold-drink equipment will be HFC-free.  Progress: Off track.  In 2012,  our system purchased approximately 245000 units of HFC-free equipment (approximately 21 percent of new equipment purchases),  bringing our global total to over 800000 units.  Because of the high global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)we are phasing out the use of HFC refrigerants in our cold-drink equipment.  With more than 14 million dispensersvending machines and coolers in the marketplace,  we have an enormous opportunity to make a difference.  We believe we can avoid the emission of more than 525 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent over the next several years—equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of over 109 million passenger vehicles.  In 2011,  we reaffirmed CO2 as our system is HFC-free refrigerant of choice for new equipment purchases; at the end of 2012,  HFC-free deployments across our system exceeded 800000.  Still,  our efforts to deploy more HFC-free cooling systems in 2012 fell short of our ambition.  Our goal was for 50 percent of all new cold-drink equipment to be HFCfree by the end of 2012.  But only about 21 percent (approximately 245000 units) of our 2012 cold-drink equipment purchases were HFC-free.  Difficulties in procuring HFC-free equipment in BrazilIndia and other countries contributed to the slowdown in our progress.  We are developing strategies to address these challenges and get back on track for our 2015 goal.

Sustainable Agriculture Inside every bottle of Coca-Cola®—indeed,  in most of our products—are ingredients that get their start on a farm.  We buy many tons of sugar,  fruit,  corn,  tea,  coffee and other ingredients every year.  Our business depends on the long-term availability of these products.  At the same time,  the future of the planet may depend on crops being grown more sustainably.  As our longtime partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and others note,  unsustainable agricultural practices have serious impacts on people and the environment.  According to WWF,  agriculture uses about 69 percent of the world is fresh water.  It is the leading source of pollution in many countries,  a primary driver of deforestation and one of the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.  Half the planet is topsoil has vanished over the last 150 years due in part to poor farming practices.  In our value chain,  agriculture accounts for the largest share of water use and the third-largest share of carbon emissionsafter packaging and refrigeration.  If growers are to provide the food necessary to support the over 9 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2050,  they must find ways to make agriculture more efficient and aligned with ecological limits—and change must happen soon.  Promoting agricultural sustainability is also a socioeconomic imperative.  Agriculture is the world is largest industryproducing $13 trillion in food annually and employing over 1 billion people.  For three-quarters of the world is extremely poor people,  farming is the only viable way to make a living.  Farming in the 21st century must protect the rights and The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

accountability for our impact all the way to the farm level.  
For all of these reasons,  we have worked with our suppliers for several years to make our supply chain more sustainable.  In 2012 and 2013,  our work took a major stride forward.  Following is a look at our progress.  
To guide progress toward our new goal,  we have established Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles for our suppliers.  These principles define what we mean when we refer to 'more sustainable sourcing, " articulate our expectations,  and set criteria for human and workplace rights,  environmental stewardship and farm management.  We are working with suppliers and with WWF to implement the guidelines throughout our system.  In April 2013we asked suppliers to provide action plans for meeting our sustainability criteria along with baselines for where they currently stand in relation to our goal.  We will evaluate their plans and work collaboratively to set a path toward achieving our goal of sustainably sourcing key agricultural ingredients by 2020.  
An ambitious new goal for sustainable sourcing Throughout 2012,  our system collaborated with WWF and other partners to develop a goal that we believe is both bold and achievable: to sustainably source key agricultural ingredients by 2020.  These ingredients include cane sugar,  beet sugar,  highfructose starch-based syrup (primarily corn),  tea,  coffee,  palm oil,  soy,  pulp and paper fiber,  oranges,  lemons,  grapesapples and mangoes.  We set this new goal for a few reasons.  First,  sustainable sourcing can ensure continuity in our supply of safehigh-quality raw materials,  reducing business risk and delivering sustainable business value for us and for our supply chain partners.  Just as importantsustainable sourcing is essential if we are serious about improving our environmental,  economic and social impacts,  as the footprint of agriculture in our supply chain exceeds that of our system is operations.  And,  increasinglycustomers,  consumers,  environmental partners and other stakeholders expect us to demonstrate end-to-end World 
Sustainable Agriculture 
Our new goal is a significant step in the shift toward more sustainable sourcing that we and our suppliers have been making for several years.  Some of our suppliers already comply with many,  if not all,  of our guiding principles.  In the coming months,  we will identify the best existing sustainability practices among our suppliers and encourage their application across our supply chain.  We plan to begin validating suppliers for compliance in 2015 and are working with internal stakeholders,  suppliers and partner organizations to establish details on the assurance process.  
We expect our guiding principles to ultimately have the greatest impact at the farm level,  where we believe some of the greatest strides toward sustainability can be made.  But working to change the practices of hundreds of small-scale farmers—such as those in the coffee and sugarcane industries— presents challenges,  and the process will take time.  We are working with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other partners around the world to develop the best ways of connecting and collaborating with farmers.  As more of our suppliers adopt sustainable practices,  we will work with them to find a fair balance in the prices we pay for ingredients.  We expect to take a 'preference,  not premium" approach,  rewarding suppliers who comply with our guiding principles sooner by strengthening our business with them.  We also want to encourage suppliers to adopt sustainable practices by recognizing their progress whenever we can.  For example,  in 2013,  we presented sugar supplier Raízen with our Company is Supplier Sustainability Award for its work leading the sugar industry toward more Bonsucro Standard–certified sugar.  Listening to the experts In February 2013,  we convened a small number of globally renowned agriculture and environment experts to discuss the global movement toward sustainable agriculture and our role within it.  The group shared positive feedback on our sustainable agriculture strategy to date and also challenged us to do more,  both within our supply chain and beyond it,  as a leader in our industry.  Our new 2020 commitment isin part,  a response to that challenge.  Slow but steady growth in Bonsucro-certified sugar One of our first major steps toward sustainable sourcing was our work with Bonsucro,  a collaboration among peer companies,  sugarcane producersWWF and other NGOs,  to implement the first global metric standard for more The Coca-Cola Company GRI Report

sustainable sugarcane production.  The Bonsucro Standard requires evaluation against 20 criteria and 69 indicators on the environmental,  social and economic impacts of sugarcane production and is divided into five principles:  Obey the law.   Respect human rights and labor standards.   Manage input,  production and processing efficiencies to enhance sustainability.  
40+ sustainable agriculture projects are supported in 25 countries 
 Actively manage biodiversity and ecosystem services.   Continuously improve key areas of the business.  Bonsucro launched its Production Standard and certification program in 2010.  In 2011,  a sugar mill in São Paulo,  Brazil,  became the first to achieve Bonsucro Certificationand our system was the first buyer of the mill is certified sugar.  As of September 2013,  31 sugarcane mills in Brazil and Australia,  representing more than 695000 hectares (approximately 17 million acres),  or 292 percent of the world is surface under sugarcane,  have been Bonsucro Certified.  The amount of sugar certified under the standard has increased steadily since the first mill was certified in 2011.  As part of our new 2020 commitmentwe have drafted plans to achieve Bonsucro standards,  or the equivalentin our sugar supply.

Improving mango yields in Andhra Pradesh In 2011,  Coca-Cola India and Jain Irrigation announced the launch of Project Unnati,  which is encouraging mango farmers in the state of Andhra Pradesh to adopt drip irrigation and a method of farming called ultra-highdensity plantation practice.  Ultra-highdensity plantation practice enables mango orchards to reach their full fruit-bearing potential in three to four years rather than the seven to nine years enabled by conventional farmingmeaning farmers earn money from the fruit sooner.  The practice also makes it possible for farmers to plant as many as 600 trees per acre,  dramatically increasing yields.  Conventional farming methods allow for about 40 trees per acre.  During the first phase of the project200 demonstration farms between one and three acres in size will employ the ultra-high-density plantation technique along with drip irrigation,  which uses less water per kilogram of mangoes produced.  Later,  the demonstration farms will be used to train other farmers.  In all,  Project Unnati has the potential to double mango yields and improve the livelihoods of more than 50000 farmers over a five-year period.

The project provides funding and technical expertise to farmers who have developed new practices to promote sustainability but need resources to implement them.  Communication is also a key part of Project Catalyst,  as newsletters and a website promote innovations,  enabling growers to share best practices and lessons learned.  Since its launch in 2009,  Project Catalyst has increased from 19 participating sugarcane growers and 4800 hectares (approximately 11860 acres) of farmland to 140 growers and more than 198000 hectares (approximately 490000 acres).  The project has improved the quality of more than 205500 megaliters (more than 54 billion gallons) of runoff by reducing the amount of nitrogenphosphorus,  herbicide and other pollutants in the runoff,  thereby reducing impact on the Great Barrier Reef.

Protecting freshwater and small farms in South Africa Through Project Khula,  The Coca-Cola Foundation is working with WWF and a number of local partners,  including Illovo Sugar and others,  to help small-scale sugarcane farmers in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa improve their yields and livelihoods while reducing environmental impacts.  The Coca-Cola Foundation provided a $150000 grant to help support the project.  Launched in September 2010 and named for the Zulu word for 'growth, " Project Khula leverages the mentorship program of a local growers association to train small-scale farmers in better land and catchment management practices.  It aims to support development of more than 3000 small-scale growers on over 8400 hectares (approximately 20756 acres),  and to help the local sugar millthe local government and other local stakeholders organize smaller farms into cooperatives.  The cooperatives are expected to help improve productivity and provide opportunities for funding expansion of the program.  Mentors will work with farmers to help maintain and restore riparian areas and increase pesticide use-efficiency.  The project also seeks to remove invasive plant species threatening freshwater ecosystems and to develop improved sustainability practices that can be adopted by other South African sugarcane growers.  To date,  the project team has assisted in the formation of two planned cooperatives,  engaging 97 farmers who 
farm about 100 hectares (250 acres).  Sugarcane plantings on the farms could eventually produce as much as 8000 metric tons of sugar every two yearsproviding farmers and their families with a potential collective income of 3 million rand.  Improving livelihoods for fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda Our goal is to triple our juice business by 2020.  To make sure we can source enough juice to meet that target—and to help improve the livelihoods of smallscale fruit farmers,  many of whom are women—we formed Project Nurturean innovative four-year,  $115 million partnership launched in 2010 with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the nonprofit organization TechnoServe.  By increasing production of mango and passion fruit suitable for both the fresh fruit and juice markets,  Project Nurture is intended to double the incomes of more than 51000 small-scale mango and passion fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda by 2014.  Our East Africa business unit will invest a total of $4 million in the project,  along with $15 million in in-kind contributionsincluding infrastructure investmenttechnical expertise and fruit purchases.  Through Project Nurture,  local farmers will find a market for their fruit.  Consumers will be able to support their local farmers through the purchase of beverages.  And our business will benefit from procuring locally produced fruit,  lowering our costs and increasing supply chain flexibility.  The program has established a goal that by 2014 at least 30 percent of participating farmers will be women.  By the end of 2012,  nearly 40000 farmers—14000 of whom were

women—had received training through Project Nurture.  More than 36000 metric tons of fresh fruit from Project Nurture farms were sold.  Participating farmers' annual fruit incomes have,  on average,  already more than doubled through a combination of increased volume sales and improved quality.  Project farmers are selling into three market channels: fruit processingfresh domestic and fresh export.  Minute Maid Mango Nectar™,  launched in Kenya in 2010,  is the first product to use juice sourced from Project Nurture and provides consumers with the opportunity to support local mango farmers.  As part of the project,  TechnoServe has worked with select farmers and exporters to ship fresh mangoes and passion fruit to the Middle East.  Farmers have been trained in quality specifications,  logistics and price negotiation.  Project Nurture provides assistance with agronomy and postharvest handling as well.  Through the project,  two more Kenyan mango varieties,  Apple and Tommy,  have been developed for use in the manufacture of Minute Maid® juice and juice drinks.  Juice made with the Apple variety is now in production.

We began implementing Haiti Hope in September 2010,  nine months after Haiti is catastrophic earthquake.  Since then,  the project team has established relationships with farmer groups representing thousands of mango farmers.  More than 16000 farmers had joined the program by the end of 2012,  and nearly half were women.  In addition,  more than 1400 farmers have received credit through the project.  A detailed training program continues to be implemented covering gender,  organizational,  technical and commercial issues.  More than 2300 training sessions have been conducted.  The Coca-Cola Company has pledged to invest $35 million to the project over its five-year span as part of the overall $95 million partnership.

In Myanmar,  it is not uncommon for the traffic police and other government employees to request facilitating payments (small payments to low-level officials to speed routine interactions or approvals) from commercial drivers.  The company whose operation we acquired was not immune to this practice.  We determined that on a certain date following the acquisitionwith training preceding,  we would end this practice of facilitating payments altogether.  We reviewed local processes and implemented necessary mitigation practices,  including training programsthe development of local-language cards that drivers can provide to authorities that state our policy prohibiting such payments,  and reviews to ensure that our vehicles are appropriately roadworthy and licensed.  We participate in several global forums on anti-corruption,  including the World Economic Forum is Partnering Against Corruption Initiative and the UN Global Compact is Anti-Corruption Working Group.

For more than a decadeThe Coca-Cola Company has engaged with Ceres on a wide range of sustainability issues ranging from our sustainability reporting and goals to our water policies and approach to other material environmental,  social and governance issues.  In our 2011/2012 report,  we noted highlights and outcomes from a stakeholder convening arranged by Ceres.  That conversation resulted in a report distilling shareholders' perceptions of what we are doing well in our sustainability initiatives and reporting—and where they thought we could improve.  We disclosed the feedback from the call and actions taken against those suggestions.  As we embark on communicating and delivering against a set of ambitious 2020 sustainability goals,  external stakeholders will be looking to us to transparently identify key metrics and milestones as well as demonstrate tangible progress.  To that end,  we recently continued our conversation with a group of discerning stakeholders in a conference call arranged with Ceres.  We are in the process of reviewing the transcript and notes from this call and will update our Stakeholder Engagement section online as our review and assessments are completed.

Recognizing and addressing global challenges As a global company,  we recognize there are global challenges affecting our operations at every level— from our employees and our customers to our consumers and the communities in which we operate.  At Coca-Cola,  we view challenges such as water scarcityclimate change,  economic disparity and obesity as interdependent—an improvement in one may positively affect outcomes in another.  Similarlya decline in one area may hamper progress in another.  To that end,  we continually assess and reevaluate the evolving world in which we operate and work in earnest to find solutions to the global challenges facing humanity.  As a multinational company with strong local connectionswe tackle these global challenges with local action.  Our partnerships with NGOs,  government agencies,  academic institutions,  community organizationsnon-profits and other thought leaders afford us insight into these evolving challenges.

Key Criteria for Measurement 
Water use ratio 
Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced.  Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola system in all global production facilities,  from all sources,  including municipal,  wellsurface water and collected rain water.  This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control.  This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.  Liters of product produced include all production,  not just saleable products.  
PlantBottles™ distributed 
PlantBottle™ packaging is a PET plastic bottle made partly with renewable,  plant-based materials.  Coca-Cola is firstgeneration PlantBottle™ package replaces conventional fossil-based monoethylene glycol (MEG) one of the two primary ingredients in PET plastic with plant-based MEG.  Approximately 30% by weight of the entire PET polymer is derived from MEG.  The term distributed refers to the number of bottles sold by the Coca-Cola system to retailers.  For select groups that do not provide a calculated distributed bottle count of PlantBottle™,  the metric tons of bPET used in the reporting cycles is used to calculate the number of bottles produced using the bottle sizes and weights.  A 5% reduction factor is then applied to the number of bottles produced to arrive at a more conservative estimate of number of bottles distributed.  
Lost time incident rate (LTIR) 
 Lost Time Incident is a work-related injury or illness,  including fatality that results in one or more Lost Days.  A Lost Day occurs when,  in the opinion of the medical professional of record,  the employee is work-related injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work.  Lost Days are counted as calendar days where counting begins the first day following the injury and ends when the person is able,  in the opinion of the medical professional of record,  to return to work,  leaves employment or reaches 180 Lost Days.  The first Lost Day is the first day following the injury,  regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday,  if the criteria for Lost Day are met.  The Lost Time Incident rate (LTIR) is calculated by multiplying the number of Lost Time Incidents by 200000 then dividing by the number of hours worked during the reporting period.  The LTIR is out of 100 employees and is based on Lost Time Incidents per 200000 hours worked (100 full time equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks).  Due to the possibility of first aids becoming a Lost Time Incident over time,  TCCC is Lost Time Incident rate was determined as of July 15,  2013 for the year ended December 31,  2012.  The scope of reporting is limited to data collected for TCCC and TCCC-owned or controlled operations.  Employees include all hourly,  salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of TCCC and TCCC-owned or controlled operations,  as well as contractors and temporary employees who are not on a facility is payroll,  but for whom facility management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details,  means,  methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished.  The number of Lost Time Incidents refers to the total number of Lost Time Incidents during the reporting period.  The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees.  This excludes hours not worked,  such as vacations,  holidays,  or absences.
