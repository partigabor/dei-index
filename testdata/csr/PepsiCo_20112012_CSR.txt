Performance with Purpose is our goal to deliver sustained value by providing a wide range of foods and beverages,  from treats to healthy eats; finding innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment and lower our costs through energy and water conservation as well as reduce use of packaging material; providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our employees globally; and respecting,  supporting and investing in the local communities in which we operate.  As we look out across the world,  we see megatrends that make Performance with Purpose more important now than ever.  These megatrends include the increasing focus of consumers and governments on health and wellness,  growing concern over food safety and traceability,  scarcity of critical global resources,  and the growing importance of talent development within our business and communities.  Each of these megatrends presents an opportunity for PepsiCo to add value by delivering innovative solutions to societal challenges and,  in doing so,  create value for our stakeholders.  
These megatrends also affirm that the work of modern business must encompass partnerships with the publicprivate and nonprofit sectors,  which is a central tenet of Performance with Purpose.  PepsiCo was one of the first contemporary ­corporations to recognize the important interdependence between corporations and society when we articulated Performance with Purpose back in 2007.  We recognize that partnerships with stakeholders across the globe in the public,  private and nonprofit sectors are vital to our business and long-term success.

CEO Letter 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2011/2012 
CEO letter Dear Fellow StakeholdersThe test of a great company is whether it has the ability to constantly manage for both the level of returns and the duration over which those returns will be realized.  It is a challenge that we at PepsiCo embrace,  because we recognize that there is always a bigger picture,  a longer time horizon and a broader world in which we operate.  Our heritage as a food and beverage powerhouse runs deep.  What began with Pepsi-Cola more than a century ago and became PepsiCo with the addition of the Frito-Lay snack business nearly 50 years ago,  has transformed into a globaldiversified company with more than $65 billion in annual revenue.  We are the largest food and beverage business in the United States and one of the largest in the world.  
If our history and trajectory have taught us one thing,  it is that we have to think in terms of both quarters and generations.  Business does not operate in a vacuum — ​it operates under a license from society.  We recognized early that when we transform our business to deliver for our consumers,  protect our environment,  and invest in our employees — ​we achieve sustained value.  In fact,  these actions fuel our financial returns.  
CEO Letter 
In 2012 49% of our U.S.  beverage volume was in juices,  lowor zero-calorie drinks,  and active hydration beverages.  
	 Providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our employees around the globe to attract and retain the best talent,  and investing in the communities in which we do business to retain our license to operate.  From our operations on farms and the plant floorto delivery of our products to store shelves,  to strategic decision making — ​we are guided by Performance with Purpose.  It is more than a vision statement.  It is the soul of PepsiCo.  Over the past seven years,  we have woven Performance with Purpose into every aspect of our business — ​and in doing so,  changed the very fabric of our company.  We have achieved some impressive results.  We are transforming our portfolio to offer consumers more choice,  successfully launching nutritious products like Quaker Real MedleysTrop50,  Gatorade Energy Chews,  Muller Quaker Dairy yogurt,  baked snacks,  and lower-calorie products like Pepsi Next.  In 2012,  49 percent of our U.S.  beverage volume was in juices,  low- or zero-calorie drinks,  and active hydration beverages.  We'll continue to innovate in the growing tasty nutrition space and across our portfolio to meet changing consumer needs.  
PepsiCo is talented people are vital to our continued success,  and we continuously invest in our associates,  giving them the tools and training to succeed.  I recently saw firsthand the expertise and passion of PepsiCo is diverse team in the Asia,  Middle East and Africa Sector,  where we are employing more women in Saudi Arabia than ever before.  And our Asia Pacific team has increased the female executive promotion rate to nearly 50 percent.  In the United States,  womenpeople of color and people from diverse backgrounds comprised more than 60 percent of the new hires from our college campus recruiting in 2012.  We have also established a Human Rights Operating Council to better coordinate,  implement and monitor our human rights strategy across our global operations.  
… Performance with Purpose fuels our growth and allows us to stay ahead of trends … 
In all of these areas,  Performance with Purpose fuels our growth and allows us to stay ahead of trends shaping our industry and the world in which we operate.  It galvanizes our global associatespositions our business to deliver today and well into the future,  and protects resources for the next generation.  We are proud of what we have achieved so far but recognize that there is much work to do to meet the aggressive goals we have set for ourselves.  PepsiCo has the capacity,  and the will,  to lead.  We will continue to work with governments,  NGOslocal community partners and other industry leaders toward common goals and fight for those things that make the world a better place.  At the heart of PepsiCo and our Performance with Purpose vision is the powerful idea that every footstep matters,  but so too does the horizon to which you are headed.  We are proud of the individual steps we are taking,  and the larger journey on which we have embarked.  We remain steadfastly dedicated to building a profitable and sustainable 21st century corporation — ​one that is a good investment for our shareholders,  a good environment for our employees,  a good citizen in our communities and a good steward of our planet is resources.  That is Performance with Purpose.  It is important now more than ever.

we anticipated the increasing focus on health and wellness more than 
then Quaker Oats and Gatorade.  
Overview 
In fact,  we anticipated the increasing focus on health and wellness more than 15 years ago,  beginning with the acquisition of Tropicana,  followed by the acquisitions of Quaker Oats and Gatorade.  We have worked steadily since to expand our nutrition business globally.  In 2012,  our nutrition business represented approximately 20 percent of PepsiCo is net revenue.  We are expanding our Good-for-You portfolio,  and are increasing Better-for-You choices by reducing sugar,  salt and saturated fat in our offerings without sacrificing taste.  Better-for-You products include 
baked versions of beloved treats such as Lay is,  Doritos and Cheetos,  mid-calorie Pepsi Next,  and Starbucks Refreshers.  
As one of the world is leading food and beverage companies,  PepsiCo plays an important role in helping people lead healthier lives.  We are focused on providing new offerings that meet consumer needs for both nutrition as well as convenience,  and are responsive to the concerns of governments and nongovernmental organizations,  as they broaden their focus on health and wellness.  
Human Sustainability means providing a wide range of foods and beverages,  from treats to healthy eats.  
Our efforts go beyond our business.  We are proud that PepsiCo is Chairman and CEO,  Indra K.  Nooyi,  co-chairs the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF)which has brought together 230 retailers,  food and beverage manufacturersrestaurants,  sporting goods and insurance companies and trade associations to reduce obesity,  especially childhood obesity,  by 2015.  The HWCF promotes ways to help people achieve a healthy weight through energy balance.  It focuses its efforts on two critical areas: families and schools.  In May 2013,  the HWCF announced that America is top food and beverage companies exceeded their goal of reducing 15 trillion calories in the market­place in the United States.

Product Choice GOAL: Continue to refine our food and beverage choices to meet changing consumer needs by reducing sodium,  added sugars and saturated fat,  and developing a broader portfolio of product choices.  Today,  more than ever,  consumers are seeking new options for their snacking and beverage occasions.  And now,  more than ever,  PepsiCo is strongly committed to providing a wide range of foods and beveragesfrom treats to healthy eats.  We have greatly expanded our portfolio of healthiergreat-tasting and convenient food and beverages.  In the U.S.,  for example,  low- or zero-calorie beverages,  active hydration offerings and juices collectively accounted for 49 percent of our 2012 beverage volume.  We have made significant progress against our saturated fat and sodium reduction goals,  while still delivering the great taste consumers expect from our snacks.  On reducing added sugars in our beverageswe have achieved reductions in the majority of our key markets,  with notable success in North America.  Meeting these goals is not easy,  but important work never is.  Our journey continues and we are more committed than ever to providing consumers with the choices they want.  
metric tons of sodium from our total foods portfolio 
PepsiCo offers three distinct product portfolios Good-for-You 
Our growing Good-for-You portfolio is comprised of nutritious foods and beverages that include fruits,  vegetables,  whole grains,  low-fat dairy,  nuts,  seeds and key nutrients,  with levels of sodium,  sugar and saturated fat that are in line with global dietary recommendations.  Also included are offerings that provide a functional benefit,  such as addressing the performance needs of athletes.  
We have improved the nutritional profile of many of our social snacks and beverages.  In snacks,  we have reduced saturated fat levels and sodium contentand we are dialing up baked offerings and whole grains.  In beverages,  we are increasing the number of low- and zerocalorie choices and reducing added sugar.  
Fun-for-You Our Fun-for-You portfolio includes treats that are enjoyed all over the world as well as regional favorites.  
of which 
metric tons of sodium comes from our key global food brands.  
Sodium We have removed 3386 metric tons of sodium from our total food portfolio since 2006 (of which 1076 metric tons comes from our key global food brands),  and continue to invest in new technologies and recipes that allow us to reduce sodium levels while maintaining great taste and enjoyment for consumers.  
At the end of 2012,  PepsiCo is Australian snacks division,  the Smith is Snackfood Company,  achieved its goal of reducing the sodium content,  on average,  across its product range by 25 percent over five years.  We improved more than 50 products from all of our major brands (Smith is Chips,  Doritos,  Twisties,  Red Rock Deli and Grain Waves) by lowering sodium ratesreformulating seasoning flavors and using a new seasoning approach.  
In Brazil,  we reduced sodium in Fandangos by more than 30 percent,  and we achieved a 30 percent sodium reduction in Doritos Nacho seasoning,  even while delivering volume growth for Doritos in Brazil in 2012 compared to 2011.  
It is important to note that we continue to find it challenging to reduce sodium on plain,  salted varieties of our snacks.  We have made progress but still have work to do against our target to reduce by 25 percent the amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands by 2015.  Since 2006,  we have achieved a reduction of 75 percent from key global food brands,  but we now anticipate it will to take us longer than expected to reach our ambitious 25 percent goal.  We continue to work toward this goal and to make investments in technology and innovation to provide products with lower sodium levels and great taste.  
reduced sodium in flavored Frito-Lay potato chips.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2011/2012 
We have made considerable headway in reducing sodium on flavored chips.  For example,  in the U.S.,  Frito-Lay has reduced sodium levels in its flavored potato chips by an average of about 25 percent.  This progress builds on earlier sodium-­ reduction efforts of 'Lightly Salted" versions of Fritos Original corn chips and Lay is Classic potato chips,  each with 50 percent less sodium than their original versions.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2011/2012 
We are achieving significant reductions in saturated fat by switching in certain instances to oils that contain lower saturated fat,  and by providing more snacks that are baked.  Since 2006,  we have reduced saturated fat per serving by 66 percent,  which means we are on track to achieve our target of a 15 percent reduction by 2020.  With this reduction,  we have removed approximately 22000 metric tons of saturated fat from our key global food brands between 2006 and 2012.  Worldwide,  PepsiCo has significantly expanded its range of baked snacks,  launching Baked Lay is and Baked Ruffles potato chips in a variety of flavors,  as well as an assortment of other baked chips and crackers.  We have also significantly reduced saturated fat in local markets by delivering locally relevant solutions.  
For example,  since 2006,  PepsiCo U.K.  and Ireland have launched Walkers Lightswhich contains 30 percent less fat,  and Walkers Baked,  which contains 70 percent less fat than our core brand.  In Australiathe entire Smith is potato chip range is cooked in high oleic sunflower and/or canola oil,  which reduces their saturated fat content by 75 percent compared to chips cooked in 100 percent palm olein oil.  In China,  increased sales of our Quaker products have helped drive a 10 percent decrease in saturated fat per serving across our foods portfolio.  In Russia saturated fat levels in our legacy business have been reduced by almost 13 percent since 2006 through the introduction of lower saturated fat versions of Cheetos snacks and the more than 300 percent growth of low saturated-fat Hrusteam products.  In Saudi Arabia,  Lay is Forno contains 60 percent less fat (and 20 percent less sodium) than regular potato chips.  
We have removed approximately 
22000 metric tons of saturated fats from our key global food brands between 2006 and 2012.  
We have removed approximately 
Sugar 
In particular,  we are proud of the results in the United States,  where low- or zero-calorie beverages,  healthy juices,  and active hydration drinks such as Pepsi MaxPepsi Next,  Mountain Dew Kickstart,  SoBe lifewaterTrop50,  and unsweetened Lipton1 Pure Leaf Ice Tea accounted for nearly half of our sales volume in 2012.  We have expanded options in our Good-for-You beverage portfolio,  which includes healthy juices as well as sports nutrition drinks.  We removed approximately 370000 metric tons of added sugar from our total beverage portfolio in North America since 2006.  We remain focused on achieving reductions in added sugar in our global beverage portfolio.  To address this,  we have offered more Good-for-You and Betterfor-You beverage choices and have stepped up the innovations we are bringing to market.  In Europe,  for example,  the majority of our beverage portfolio consists of low- or zero-calorie options.  However,  in the United States and many other markets,  consumers are moving away from diet soft drinks,  a market condition that creates a challenge for us.  As a result,  we have accelerated our research and technology investments in the development of naturally sourced sweeteners and flavorings,  which are the best paths to a meaningful reduction in added sugars.  1

The Center,  located on the site of Sabra is hummus manufacturing facility,  will further research capabilities in order to improve all aspects of Sabra is food manufacturing and distribution processes,  from agriculture,  nutrition and food science to engineering,  packaging and product delivery.  
Nutrition Labeling Trop50 was one of the most successful U.S.  product launches in the past five years.  As a result of its success in the U.S.,  we launched Trop50 in the U.K.  and Ireland in January 2013.  We made Pepsi Next for U.S.  consumers who want the rich taste of full-calorie cola but are looking to reduce the sugar in their diet.  
We follow nutrition labeling requirements in the countries where our products are sold.  In many geographic markets,  our nutrition labeling practices are more stringent than local requirements.  
We have reached 91 percent compliance in key global markets,  including the U.S, on our goal to display calorie count and key nutrients on our packaging for all of our products.  We continue to work toward 100 percent compliance in all markets.

Advertising We are implementing frontof-pack labeling in many countries,  including: Argentina,  Australia,  BrazilChile,  Malaysia,  Mexico,  New Zealand,  Paraguay,  ThailandUruguay and the United States.  
PepsiCo has taken several important steps to ensure we are employing responsible advertising practices.  We helped found the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA),  a Swiss-based NGO comprising multinational food and beverage manufacturers,  to adopt a worldwide voluntary commitment to advertise to children under the age of 12 only those products that meet specific nutrition criteria.  PepsiCo also adopted a global company policy that is consistent with IFBA is policy.  In 2010,  we announced strict sciencebased criteria that state that only our most nutritious products,  such as Quaker Oats,  meet the standard for advertising to children under the age of 12.  We achieved 99 percent compliance with this policy by the end of 2012 in globally representative markets such as Russia,  China,  Saudi Arabia and six countries in the EU,  and have increased the stringency of our policy by lowering the audience threshold from 50 percent to 35 percent.  Additionally,  we achieved 100 percent compliance in the U.S.  and Canadaas verified by the Children is Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative and Advertising Standards Canada,  respectively.  
Many PepsiCo-owed bottling operations have helped to remove full calorie soft drinks from primary and secondary schools.  We are working with local communities and schools to focus on providing water,  juices,  milk and low-calorie beverages in support of healthy nutrition habits.  
We achieved 100 percent compliance with our U.S.  and Canada pledges restricting advertising to children under age 12.

PackagingRecycling and Waste 
We have reduced the packaging weight of our products by more than 
GOAL: Innovate our packaging to make it increasingly sustainable,  minimizing our impact on the environment.  Over the last five years,  we have reduced the packaging weight of our products by more than 350 million pounds in all manufacturing for which we procure packaging,  including acquisitions — ​exceeding our goal by more than 20 percent.  The packaging weight reductions we have achieved are equivalent to removing more than 95 tons of packaging material each day during that five-year period.  
In the U.S.,  initiatives led by our Aquafina team have enabled PepsiCo to avoid using more than 135 million pounds of plastic.  The current 169 ounce Aquafina bottle uses half the amount of plastic as the 2002 bottle of the same size.  For Gatorade,  the amount of resin used in 32-ounce bottles has been reduced from 45 grams to 39 grams,  resulting in approximately 595000 pounds of PET reduction in the U.S.  in 2012.  In Europe,  package light-weighting initiatives across our line of carbonated soft-drink bottles,  as well as Tropicana and Punica bottles,  have reduced bottle waste by nearly 9 million pounds in 2012.

beverage containers to recycling since 2010 in the U.S.  
GOAL: Work to eliminate solid waste to landfills from our production facilities.  In 2012,  912 percent of solid waste generated by more than 260 company-owned manufacturing facilities was put to beneficial use,  such as recycling; only 88 percent was disposed of through more traditional methods,  such as landfills.  Moreover,  around the world,  we have 61 plants that send less than 1 percent of their waste to landfills.  
Additionally,  we are facilitating recycling by our consumers and retail customers.  For example,  in the U.S.,  we have created and deployed a convenient recycling solution to capture plastic that is recycled for use in manufacturing our bottles.  Since 2010,  we have added more than 5000 recycling systems across North America through recycling programs in more than 42 states.  These systems have diverted more than 196 million beverage containers to recycling since 2010.  
Our success in increasing recycling rates and the amount of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) available for use has enabled us to incorporate,  on averageup to 10 percent of post-consumer rPET in our U.S.  primary soft drink bottles,  leading the industry.

GHG Emissions 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2011/2012 
GOAL: Work to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global businesses.  In 2012,  our GHG emissions were comparable to 2008,  having remained essentially flat after the 2008 baseline year.  This goal,  and our current progressapplies to legacy operations as they existed in 2008excluding major mergers and acquisitions and adjusting for divestitures.  The encouraging news is that we essentially kept our GHG emissions level constant from 2008 to 2012,  even as we grew production volume in foods by 7 percent and beverages by 12 percent during that time period.  
PepsiCo was named to the Global and S&P 500 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index in 2011 and 2012.  
PepsiCo was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2012 for a 
94% carbon disclosure score.  
In 2012,  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency awarded PepsiCo its ENERGY STAR 'Partner of the Year Award for Sustained Excellence. " 
We are working to improve our energy use ­efficiency in order to reduce our GHG emissionsconserve fuel and reduce our costs.  Our target is a 20 percent per unit of production improvement in energy efficiency in our manufacturing facilities and fleet globally by 2015,  compared to 2006.  This applies to legacy operations as they existed in 2006,  excluding major mergers and acquisitions since the baseline year and adjusting for divestitures.  We have made solid progress toward achieving our target.  Our energy efficiency has improved by 14 percent when compared to our 2006 baseline.  This improvement is ahead of our plan and it represents an estimated energy cost savings of more than $70 million in 2012.  Progress toward the reduction target is driven by our resource conservation initiatives aimed at improving the energy efficiency of our operations,  as well as conversion to renewable forms of energy.  Our snack plants in Pune and Kolkata,  India demonstrate how we are reducing our use of fossil fuels; both plants are powered in part by biomass boilers.  On the other side of the globeour Gatorade manufacturing facility in TollesonArizona is in the process of expanding its existing solar thermal system.  In the first phase of its solar thermal energy journey,  we offset approximately 7500 MMBtu of natural gas consumption at the facility.  The second phase of improvements,  scheduled to be completed in 2013,  will utilize three different innovative collector technologies: flat panel,  parabolic and trough.  Field evaluation of each technology will aid with future reapplication decisions.  
We have also increased energy efficiency in our fleet,  incorporating sustainable approaches into everyday practices and long-term business plans.  In the U.S.,  PepsiCo uses EPA is SmartWay-certified carriers for 100 percent of our transportation needs,  setting a standard for the industry.  In fact,  Frito-Lay North America has the largest company-owned electric fleet in the United States.  Since their introduction in 2010,  Frito-Lay is electric vehicles have traveled nearly 3 million miles,  reducing carbon emissions by 5000 metric tons.  Additionallyin 2012 we launched a program to add to our fleet vehicles that run on converted natural gas to further increase fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  Our proprietary Resource Conservation System (ReCon),  which we built,  enables us to identify and implement new ways to advance our Environmental Sustainability goals.  ReCon provides assessment and knowledge management tools that help us identify and share best practices for water conservation,  GHG measurement and management,  and solid waste reduction.  Incremental improvements enabled by ReCon have added up to significant cost savings for our company.  To amplify this success,  PepsiCo has made ReCon available to our franchise bottlers,  copacker partners and direct suppliers to enable them to reduce their impact on the environment while saving costs.

Agriculture 
As a leading food and beverage company,  agriculture is central to our business.  Because of the critical importance of growing crops to PepsiCo,  we are working to incorporate into our operations the best thinking,  practices and technology to support sustainable agriculture.  In addition to increasing the resiliency of our supply chain,  we are pursuing opportunities — ​often through stakeholder partnerships across the public,  private,  NGO,  nonprofit and academic sectors — ​to reduce on-farm water use and GHG ­emissions as well as to improve farmer livelihoods.  In 2012,  we launched our Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI).  The SFI is a comprehensive program with application to potato,  citrus,  oats,  rice and corn crops and to growers of all sizes in developed,  developing and emerging markets.  It enables PepsiCo to measure the environmental and local economic impacts associated with our agricultural supply chain.  By the end of 2012,  we completed 36 SFI pilot programs in 14 countries.  In January 2013,  we launched SFI in the North American market for Frito-Lay North America potato growers.  We plan to continue to expand SFI,  throughout 2013 and beyond,  across global markets for crops key to our business in order to drive continued improvement in our agricultural operations.  
Our agriculture team in our foods business in Turkey has pioneered a way to reduce CO2 emissions by producing fertilizer from what would otherwise be discarded as manufacturing waste.  This fertilizer is now being used by PepsiCo potato growerswhich is helping to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 19 percent.  
SFI pilot programs 
By the end of 2012we completed 36 SFI pilot programs in 14 countries.  
Our commitment to responsible sourcing includes respecting human rights and the environment.  PepsiCo is SFI is a comprehensive on-farm verification program that focuses on the three pillars of sustainability — ​environment,  social and economic.  Environmental indicators support protection of natural resources and environmental improvement; social indicators center on respect for human rights,  the well-being of local communities and basic health and nutrition; and economic indicators promote sound management practicesresource efficiency,  and commercial relationships to ensure greater productivity and continuity of operation.  With a focus on these issues,  together with our farmer suppliers,  we plan to increase supply chain productivity,  build greater resilience to uncertainty and reduce risk to farmers and to PepsiCo.  SFI was developed with consultation and review from key external stakeholders.  For instance,  Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) assisted in developing the social and economic indicators,  which were piloted in China.
