ABOUT THIS REPORT 
MATERIALITY 
In 2011,  we undertook an internal and external review of our CRS aspirations and listened to a wide range of stakeholders' views and expectations of how our business could contribute to a more sustainable tomorrow.  This work guided the development of our sustainability plan,  'Deliver for today; Inspire for tomorrow' (see Sustainability Plan below).  The plan outlines our commitments and targets in seven areas deemed to be of the greatest materiality for CRS in our territories: Energy and Climate Change,  Sustainable Packaging and Recycling,  Water StewardshipProduct Portfolio,  Active Healthy LivingCommunity and Workplace.  Progress against our targets is measured by a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  See Factsheet 24 for 2013 KPI data.  Coca-Cola products are made by more than 250 bottling partners worldwide on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company,  which creates and 
SUSTAINABILITY PLAN 
markets brands and trademarks and manufactures syrups.  As one of the licensedindependent bottling partners within the Coca-Cola System,  CCE purchases,  produces and packages beverages to sell and distribute to retail and wholesale customers.  Our relationship with The Coca-Cola Company influences the way we work,  our spheres of responsibility and how we determine our material issues.  Our CRS commitments reflect our most significant sustainability impactsas identified by our 2011 review,  and are aligned with The Coca-Cola Company (see A Joint CRS Vision overleaf).  We have made considerable progress against many of our commitments and have learned a lot since our plan was launched.  However,  we also recognize that CRS leadership has evolved.  During 2014we intend to review our plan to continue to develop our sustainability journey.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
CEO Statement INTERVIEW WITH JOHN F.  BROCK AND HUBERT PATRICOT 
Q.  In October 2014,  CCE is sustainability plan will be three years old.  What have you achieved so far? A.  John F.  Brock: When we launched our sustainability plan,  we committed to become a 'low-carbon,  zero-waste' business and defined priorities for our sustainability leadership.  The good news is we have made some excellent progress and reduced the absolute carbon footprint of our core business operations by 23 percent (exceeding our original 15 percent target).  A.  Hubert Patricot: In demonstrating leadership on sustainable packaging and recycling,  we made an important decision to look outside of our traditional business model.  We invested $18 million in two recycling joint ventures and,  as a resulthave significantly increased the amount of PET plastic which can be reprocessed in Great Britain and France and secured a long-term supply of high quality recycled PET for our bottles.  
Q.  What have you learned and what challenges have you faced? 
A.  Hubert Patricot: We have learned a lotparticularly about the role that innovation and technology can play in accelerating the pace of change.  Collaboration is critical – we need to share intelligence,  maximize resources,  and pool ideas if we are to address our challenges and create value 
from our sustainability leadership.  This was the focus of our first Sustainability Innovation Summit,  held in October 2013.  The event provided a valuable opportunity to learn from pioneers and influential thinkers.  A.  John F.  Brock: Our research has shown that many in the wider business community still face hurdles in making the case for sustainability.  The companies that are committed to sustainability are seeing results,  but it still needs to be  isold in' to some businesses.  Additionally,  while we are ahead of plan in certain areaswe have found a number of our targets more challenging to achieve than we originally expected.  Renewable energy is a great example we have had some success,  but are not currently on track to meet our long-term target.  In 2014,  we'll look again at our strategy and evaluate what success and leadership looks like.  
Q.  Why does sustainability remain at the heart of your business strategy in tough times? 
A.  John F.  Brock: We all face significant societal and environmental challenges such as increased demand for natural resourceswater scarcity and continued climate change.  Forward thinking businesses will be able to turn these challenges into opportunities.  We are proud of the environmental leadership that we have been able to demonstrate,  yet we acknowledge that stakeholder expectations continue to 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Chairman and CEO,  John F.  Brock (right),  and Executive Vice President and PresidentEuropean GroupCoca-Cola EnterprisesHubert Patricot (left) 
increase,  particularly on obesity,  health and well-being.  We are making strides to create a positive impact through our support for local active lifestyle programs and our broad portfolio of no- and low- calorie beveragesbut we know there is much more to do.  A.  Hubert Patricot: We have also seen many business benefits from our work on sustainability greater employee engagement,  enhanced efficiency and effectiveness and stronger trust at a local level where we are proud to support our communities and make a significant socio-economic contribution.  
Q.  What role will technology play as part of your sustainability agenda? 
A.  Hubert Patricot: Technology is an important enabler of collaboration,  which is becoming increasingly critical for a successful sustainability program.  Our partnership with OpenIDEO enabled us to utilize an open innovation platform to draw on the optimism,  inspiration and ideas of creative thinkers around the world to develop powerful ideas about how to increase at-home recycling.  A.  John F.  Brock: Technology is also proving to be a powerful sustainability driver.  Many companies are using smart,  online technologies to measure and reduce their environmental impact.  Others are using technology to design more sustainable products,  packaging and services.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
CEO STATEMENT AND HIGHLIGHTS 
Q.  Are expectations of business and business leaders changing? 
A.  John F.  Brock: I have seen how dramatically expectations of business have changed in the last 20 years.  Today,  businesses are expected to take a wider view,  to make a profit,  define their wider contribution to society and protect the planet.  A.  Hubert Patricot: Successful organizations take a holistic approach to defining value for both shareholders and stakeholders.  Sustainability no longer works in isolation – it touches all areas of business.  In the future,  the most successful businesses will be those that put sustainability at the heart of business decision-making and create value from sustainability.  A.  John F.  Brock: As business leaders todaywe need to ask ourselves what we want to be remembered for.  We need to drive sustainability and inspire change throughout our own organizations and simultaneously address the concerns of future generations.  
Q.  Where do you seek inspiration from,  as you look to inspire for tomorrow? 
A.  John F.  Brock: We learn from many different organizations that are making a strong business case for sustainabilityembracing the transformative power 
of innovation and reshaping the interconnectivity between business and society.  A.  Hubert Patricot: We continue to take inspiration from the sustainability leadership shown by companies like Unilever,  Kingfisher and Zipcar,  as well as organizations like the EU Climate Leaders Group and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which is working to demonstrate the potential of the circular economy.  
Q.  What is next on your sustainability journey? Are there any particular areas you will target as you review your commitments in the future? 
John F.  Brock Chairman and CEO Coca-Cola Enterprises,  Inc.  (CCE) 
Hubert Patricot Executive Vice President and President,  European Group Coca-Cola Enterprises,  Inc.  (CCE) 
A.  John F.  Brock: Our sustainability agenda does not stand still; it continues to evolve and stakeholder expectations continue to rise.  In 2014 we will undertake a full review of our sustainability plan.  We'll also hold a second Sustainability Innovation Summit and continue to explore opportunities for collaboration across our value chain.  We know we have to accelerate our efforts and are determined to create value from our sustainability leadership in the future.

OUR BUSINESS 
OUR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN 
Our business has environmental and social impacts across the life cycle of our products from the sourcing and use of raw materials and ingredients,  to the manufacturing of our products and their disposal.  Our vision and goals,  set out in our sustainability plan,  focus on reducing our impacts at each stage of our value chain and making a positive difference to the communities in which we operate.  We have made solid progress in reducing environmental impacts that we can control,  including the amount of water and packaging we use and the emissions from our cold drinks equipment.  Our 2020 vision is to deliver for today,  growing a low-carbonzero-waste business,  and inspire and lead change for a more sustainable tomorrow.  We are looking beyond our own operations and are working to innovate,  collaborate and partner with suppliers and customers to identify ways to continue to reduce impacts across our value chain.  OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS 
Our supply chain Ingredients: Approximately 95 percent of our products are made from concentrates and syrups supplied by our brand owners.  The rest are finished products that we distribute.  We buy sugar,  juices,  mineral waters and carbon dioxide to make our products (low-calorie sweeteners are already contained in the concentrates) and are working with our suppliers to reduce the environmental impacts of these raw materials.  
Recycling: Our bottles and cans are 100 percent recyclable.  However,  if they are not collected for recycling,  they become waste.  We are working to increase recycling rates across our territories,  which in turn will help us to generate more material to turn into new bottles and cans.  
Packaging: Our packaging materials come from a range of approved suppliers.  We are innovating within our own business and working with these suppliers to reduce the impacts of the packaging materials we use.  
Our business Manufacturing: We use water and energy to produce our beverages.  We are focused on increasing our operational efficiencies and minimizing our waste.  
Community and active healthy living: Coca-Cola is a local product,  made by local people and we have strong links with our communities.  We aim to make a positive difference wherever we manufacture and sell our products and to engage our communities in active lifestyle programs.  
As an employer of approximately 11750 people,  we provide jobs and pay taxes in the countries and communities in which we operate.  Distribution: We manufacture and distribute our products locally,  using road and rail.  We continue to optimize our network and are working with our hauliers to increase efficiencies and investigate new,  low-carbon ways to get our products to market.  
Where we operate 
Cooling and selling our products: Cooling our products uses energy and refrigeration gases,  so we are increasing the efficiency of our cold drinks equipment and purchase only HFC-free coolers.  
The marketplace Product portfolio: Our wide range of products reflects the changing needs and demands of our consumers across our territories.  With more than 40 brands,  our products include a wide variety of pack sizes and a high proportion of no- and low-calorie soft drinks.  We market our products in a responsible way through on-pack labeling and other media.

Our Stakeholders INTRODUCTION 
We believe in having honest conversations and ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders.  Our sustainability plan was developed by listening closely to their expectations,  setting out stretching goals and addressing the significant issues and concerns highlighted across our value chain.  We know collaboration is essential,  both to achieve our targets and for society as a whole.  As a result,  continuing engagement and partnership with our local communities,  NGOs,  suppliers,  customers and many others is fundamental to our progress and future innovation.

CASE STUDY 
Sustainability Innovation Summit In 2013,  we held our Sustainability Innovation Summit,  bringing together an international group of influential thinkers,  suppliers and customers to explore opportunities for collaborationinnovation and technology.  250 delegates heard pioneering speakers from a range of organizations including the Ellen MacArthur FoundationMcKinsey & Co.  and Goldman Sachs and participated in breakout sessions exploring challenges such as packaging of the future and driving recycling,  zerocarbon manufacturing and sustainability across the value chain.  The Summit provided a forum where all involved could learn from each other and be inspired to take meaningful action.  It also offered us valuable insight for our 2014 sustainability plan review.  (For more information see Factsheet 8. ) 
CASE STUDY 
Working with Zero In Norway,  we are working with Zeroan independent,  Oslo-based foundation which works with businesses and communities to help develop a lowemission society.

GOVERNANCE 
Our Operating Framework 
Safeguarding our future 'Governance is fundamental to our business,  and without collaboration we simply can't achieve this.  Governance is about aligning with stakeholders and ensuring transparency and it comes with visible policies,  strong communications and support from the highest level right through the organization.  That is why we are committed to building it into daily life at CCE. " T. J.  WolfeCCE VP Ethics & Compliance,  Financial Reporting 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS PLANNING 
Social and environmental risks are considered strategic business risks and are assessed annually as part of our enterprise risk model.  Incorporated within the 361 risks in our risk register are global environmental issues such as climate change,  water scarcity,  waste and pollution,  and global health and well-being trends.  Other risks include health and safetysupplier management,  ethics and compliance,  and trust and reputation.  Our top 18 risks are assigned to specific Board committees and members of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) who chair those committees.  As the ELT member responsible for CRSLaura Brightwell is accountable for social and environmental risks.  These are reviewed annually by the Board is CRS Committee and risks that could materially affect our business and financial results are disclosed in Form 10-K in CCE is Annual Report and quarterly financial reporting.  In accordance with the precautionary principle,  CRS is considered within the development process for any major projectproduct or new investment and is built into our annual business planning process.  Progress against our sustainability plan is reported every year.  ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE 
At CCE,  we follow our RIGHT Way model of ethical values.  Our actions,  decisions and behavior must always be RIGHT – maintaining Respect,  Integrity,  Good judgement,  Honesty and Trust.  These values are the foundation of our Code of Business Conduct and are qualities that underpin our decisions and working practices.  In 1	 Consolidated from 43 risks following the 2013 risk review.  
early 2014,  we also joined The Supply Chain Initiative,  which aims to promote fair business practices in the food supply chain.  
Code of Business Conduct Our Code of Business Conduct outlines the behavior we expect of every employee – The RIGHT Way.  The Code identifies 12 guiding principles including: promoting health and safety in the workplacecomplying with anti-corruption laws and upholding our environmental commitments.  It is one of the ways we comply with the ten universal principles of the UN Global Compact which CCE signed in 2007 and supports compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act.  The Code,  published on our website (www, cokecce, com) and intranet,  is underpinned by a series of policies that provide additional guidance on issues such as anti-corruption,  insider dealing and giftshospitality and entertainment.  
Training The Code is provided to all new employees during their induction and in 2013 our RIGHT Way online training was rolled out to all employees with access to a PC.  This was more than 70 percent of CCE employees.  In 2014,  we aim to extend the training to non-PC users.  Further online modules are provided as part of our Ethics and Compliance training curriculum.  Additional training in specialist areas is also offered.  
Speaking up For the Code to be effective,  employees must be able to raise concerns without fear of reprisal.

Our Manufacturing INTRODUCTION 
OUR STRATEGY 
We manufacture more than 40 brands including some of the most popular soft drinks in the world Coca-Cola,  Diet CokeCoca-Cola Light,  Coca-Cola Zero,  Fanta and Sprite.  We operate 17 manufacturing sites in six countries,  which includes a total of 87 production lines and more than 4600 employees.  
Our sustainable manufacturing strategy focuses on: 
Manufacturing is at the heart of our business.  Our focus is on excellence and efficiency,  providing quality and value for our customers and protecting the safety of our employees and the environment in which we operate.  In 2013,  we invested $65 million in process and equipment innovation and improvements.  We have also developed Sustainability Master Plans for all our sites.  We'll continue to seek further improvements within our operations and in collaboration with our suppliers.  
	 Our people: working in collaboration to continually drive better performance.  
This factsheet provides an overview of our sustainability approach within our manufacturing operations.  For more detail on our specific workplace safety,  energy and renewable energy,  water stewardship and water protection programs,  see Factsheets 14,  16,  21 and 22.

Our aim is to achieve and continually drive excellence and high operating standards in our plants.  We focus on efficiency and effectiveness through a harmonized management and operational approachrolling out consistent standards,  new innovations and best practice across our territories.  We call this the 'CCE Way'.  As part of this system,  all our plants are certified to the food safety standardFSSC 22000,  and 16 are certified to the internationally recognized standards for health and safety,  ISO 18001,  and environmental management,  ISO 14001.

OUR MANUFACTURING 
CASE STUDY 
Manufacturing for the future Between 2012 and 2013 we invested $100 million in our operations in Norway.  Our plant has been completely transformed with the installation of new lines,  the latest in production equipment and improvements to production processes,  enabling the plant to now use recyclable,  non-refillable PET bottles.  OUR PEOPLE 
WATER 
People and collaboration are key to our success.  We operate a strong network of plant and national environment and safety management teams,  working together to focus on specific projects,  corporate goals and targets as well as sharing new innovations and efficiency measures.  
Our water saving efforts focus on both innovation and encouraging the right behaviors.  Recent projects include optimizing processes and procedures linked to water treatment,  manufacturing and cleaning,  the rinsing of containers and recycling and reclaiming water where possible.  
We set environmental and safety targets annually across the company.  These are supported by improvement plans and monthly performance reviews at plantcountry and senior leadership level.  Plant directors and senior leaders are also made accountable and incentivized through the inclusion of CRS targets within personal objectives and appraisals.  
As a result,  in 2013,  we were rated the most water-efficient bottler within the Coca-Cola System and achieved our lowest ever water use ratio of 135 liters of water used per liter of product produced,  a 35 percent improvement from 2012 (140l/l).  
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT 
We devote a great deal of time,  resources and investment to driving down our energy and water use.  During 2013,  we invested more than $57 million in new production lines and equipment and a further $8 million in additional energy and water saving technologies,  collectively providing savings of $16 million,  plus more than 7200 tonnes of CO2e and 9800 cubic meters (m3) of water.  This included new PET lines in WakefieldGreat Britain and Clamart in France.  We have invested in monitoring and targeting systems and metering in our plants.  This provides operators with live data to monitor and benchmark water and energy use and identify opportunities for improvement.  We have identified our top five techniques for saving water and energy and dedicated teams are rolling these out across our plants.  We have also adopted the Water and Energy Savers programs jointly developed by The Coca-Cola Company and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to help bottlers around the world achieve new levels of efficiency.  The water program has been implemented at the majority of our plants and six facilities have been certified as completing the energy program.  
We seek both to conserve water within our own operations and to protect our water sources.  All our plants have completed Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVAs) and Source Water Protection Plans (SWPPs) to ensure water is abstracted in a sustainable way,  whether from the ground or from the municipal supply.  In recognition of our high standards of water management,  we were the first to receive the new gold-level European Water Stewardship (EWS) Standard at our facility in Dongen in the Netherlands and our mineral water plant in Chaudfontaine in Belgium.  See Factsheets 21 and 22 for more detail on water stewardship and water protection and replenishment respectively.  
Higher standards and more efficient equipment have had an outstanding impact on both environmental and safety performance.  Water and energy use in one year have reduced by 13 and 145 percent respectively and safety performance has changed from being a plant with one of the highest accident rates in CCE in 2012 to now having one of the lowest within CCE and the Coca-Cola System.  We have also invested in low-carbon and renewable energy with solar photovoltaic panels installed in Great Britain at EdmontonSidcup,  Wakefield and our new head office in Uxbridge where they are linked to electric car charging points.  In 2014,  we plan to instal a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit at Wakefield in Great Britain and are continuing the pilot project between our Dongen plant in the Netherlands and a neighboring glass manufacturer,  Ardagh,  to test whether we can capture and use waste heat lost during glass production.  See Factsheet 16 for more detail on our energy and renewable energy strategy.  WASTE AND RECYCLING 
We are committed to reducing and recycling the waste at our manufacturing plants.  The vast majority of this waste is readily recyclable and for many years we have operated a robust waste recycling program based on raising awarenessmonitoring waste data and separating waste at source.  In 2009,  we set a target of zero waste to landfill by the end of 2014.  In 201314 sites had achieved this goal and 995 percent of our overall waste was being recycled or recovered compared to 994 percent in 2012.  
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLES 
Fostering good behaviors is also at the heart of our energy-efficiency programs.  We have a company-wide maintenance and air leak survey and repair program and carry out equipment upgrades to reduce energy use.  In 2013,  these included installing energy-efficient LED lighting,  making our bottle-blowers more efficient,  converting our packer ovens to gas,  optimizing our compressed air systems and introducing conveyor sleep modes.  With these and other initiatives,  in 2013 we achieved our lowest-ever energy use ratio of 7683 kWh per 1000 liters of manufactured product,  a reduction of nearly six percent since 2012 (8154 kWh).  
CASE STUDY 
Carbon Trust Standards CCE holds the Carbon Trust Standard for greenhouse gas reduction and in 2013 was one of the first businesses to gain the newly created Carbon Trust Water Standard for efficient water use.  These standards are designed to recognize an organization is commitment and achievements in carbon and water management.  Both awards apply across our entire European operation.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
We are working with our suppliers to improve their sustainability performance and reduce carbon emissions across our value chain.  
Suppliers and Sustainability INTRODUCTION 
OUR STRATEGY 
We recognize that our suppliers are essential partners in our sustainability journey.  From analyzing our water and carbon footprintwe found that our most significant environmental impacts occur outside of our own business,  in our value chain.  We believe collaboration and innovation throughout our supply chain are essential in advancing our sustainable growth.  We want to inspire and drive sustainable change with those we work with as well as through our own organization.  We have embedded sustainability into our procurement processes and supplier relationships,  and have developed additional programs to support strategic opportunities for collaboration.  
We are working with 140 of our key suppliers to reduce carbon emissions across each stage of our value chain.  
We held our fourth Supplier Sustainability meeting with our suppliers to investigate ways we can work together to encourage innovation throughout our value chain.  
of our procurement spend in 2013 was in countries where we operate and 96 percent was within the EU.  
We spent more than $39 billion with approximately 13400 suppliers in 2013.  
Our sustainable procurement strategy focuses on three pillars: 	 Our people: training our procurement teams on sustainability.  	 Our procurement processes: ensuring our processes support sustainable purchasing decisions.  	 Our suppliers: encouraging our suppliers to improve their own sustainability performance.  OUR PEOPLE 
In CCE,  we have developed a bespoke modular training toolkit to equip our procurement teams with a good understanding of what we mean by sustainability and how this affects our purchasing decisions.  The toolkit comprises of: 	 Module 1 CCE is sustainability journey and commitments.  	 Module 2 CCE is expectations of suppliers and how to use our supplier scorecard.  	 Module 3 sustainability issues related to specific commodities.  In 2013,  we rolled out this program to procurement teams in all of our territories.  All of our procurement managers working directly with suppliers have now received this training,  enabling them to work with suppliers to identify opportunities,  further drive our sustainability ambitions and help build long-term supplier value.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
SUPPLIERS AND SUSTAINABILITY 
OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESSES 
We have been working to embed sustainability criteria into all our procurement processes,  from sourcing new suppliers to tendering.  We want to ensure that our suppliers understand and adhere to our own sustainability standards.  To help uswe have a number of mechanisms in place.  
Code of Business Conduct Our Code of Business Conduct outlines the principles by which we operate within CCE and how we work with our suppliers.  The code is available on our website – www, cokecce, com.  
Supplier Guiding Principles Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) set out the minimum requirements we expect our suppliers to adhere to,  including labor laws and regulations,  health and safety,  human rights,  environment and business integrity (see below).  Our SGPs reflect and communicate our own principles and emphasize the importance of responsible workplace policies and practices,  respect for human rights and environmental protection.  SGPs are included in all new contracts and are being incorporated into current multi-year contracts during renewal.  In 201367 percent of our spend with suppliers was covered by contracts containing our SGPs.  The Coca-Cola Company works with independent third-party auditors to regularly monitor the SGP compliance of companies which supply to the Coca-Cola System.   In the last three years,  they have undertaken a series of audits including over two thirds of Coca-Cola Enterprises' suppliers of ingredients and packaging.  Together with The Coca-Cola CompanyCCE is a member of the AIM-PROGRESS forum a global group promoting 
responsible sourcing practices and audit program design to align supplier audits and reduce duplication and costs for suppliers.  Our audits are aligned with the forum and are recognized by its members.  Similarlywe recognize audits carried out on behalf of other signatory companies.  In 2013,  we adopted The Coca-Cola Company is Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles for suppliers of sugar beet and sugar cane as part of our sustainable agriculture program.  We are now developing bespoke tools to support our sustainable sourcing strategy.  (For more information see Factsheet 23. ) OUR SUPPLIERS 
Our aim is to work with our suppliers to encourage them to improve their own sustainability performance.  Our Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) process underpins the management of our relationships with our key suppliershelping to build collaboration and provide management focus.  We use a framework to evaluate each supplier is performance based on quality,  cost and value,  service and innovation,  and corporate responsibility and sustainability (CRS).  The CRS evaluation comprises two inputs: 	 Sustainability rating from an independent company,  EcoVadis.  
EcoVadis evaluates our suppliers on four areas environmental,  social,  ethical and supply chain management and undertakes a 360 degree review of the organization.  In collaboration with our suppliers,  this information is used to develop action plans to help them raise their rating and create risk reduction plans.  
Our SGPs outline minimum requirements and address the following key areas: 
Our 'Carbon Challenge' supports our carbon commitment.  This three-stage program is designed to prioritize efforts and encourage suppliers to progress along each stage of their carbon management journey.  
	 Forced labor 	 Abuse of labor 	 Freedom of association and collective bargaining 	 Discrimination 	 Wages and benefits 	 Work hours and overtime 	 Health and safety 	 Environment 	 Demonstration of compliance 
In 2013,  we held a virtual supplier sustainability meeting and webinar to bring together our key suppliers and continue our CRS collaboration and innovation dialogue.  More than 140 suppliers and 300 people participated in the meeting,  which focused on sharing experiences and supplier examples to showcase how organizations have improved their sustainability performance and carbon footprint.  To extend and continue our discussionswe launched our online sustainability hub.  Hosted by 2degrees,  a sustainability network organization,  the hub has enabled us to share and collaborate across our value chain even further.

Outstanding performance is recognized annually by our Supplier of the Year awards.  In 2013,  our CRS Supplier of the Year was one of our cold drink equipment suppliers,  ISA.  Where the score is low,  we work with the supplier to improve their score.  
The challenge starts by encouraging each organization to measure and manage its carbon footprint,  then to develop carbon improvement plans and finally to share carbon information.  Suppliers are directed towards particular stages of the challenge to reflect the carbon classification assigned to the commodity or service they provide lowmedium or high impact (see CCE is Carbon Challenge Process).

In October 2013we held our first Sustainability Innovation Summit to explore how business can use innovationtechnology and collaboration for a more sustainable tomorrow.  
Innovate for the Future INTRODUCTION 
'Innovate for the Future' is one of three strategic priorities within our sustainability plan.  We are making good progress towards many of our sustainability targets.  However,  we recognize that the size and scale of the sustainability challenges we face will require industry leaders to accelerate progress at a faster rate.  We need to drive new opportunities for innovation,  collaboration and partnership and inspire people to think differently both inside and outside our company.  OUR STRATEGY 
We are focused on solutions that will take us beyond our four walls benefiting ourselves,  broader industry and society as a whole through: 	Thought leadership to explore and develop solutions to new issues and challenges.  	Collaboration and engagement with suppliers,  customers and other stakeholders to drive innovation and unlock new ideas and opportunities.  	Accelerating the pace of change by developing and harnessing innovation and technology.  
THOUGHT LEADERSHIP 
In 2013,  we worked with the Economist Intelligence Unit to explore how senior business leaders view the sustainability strategies and commitments that businesses are making and to understand what the key drivers and barriers to success have been.  
Sustainability Insights Learning from Business Leaders 1 highlighted that many companies are moving forward with their sustainability activities,  despite the recent economic downturn.  The research also highlighted that: 	 Technology is proving to be a powerful sustainability driver.  	 Leading companies are turning to a broader form of collaboration.  	 Innovative and disruptive business models have the potential to impact the way mainstream business operates and address social and environmental challenges.  	 Building the right business case remains challenging due to concerns about the perceived high cost and lack of rate of return.  Our work with the Economist Intelligence Unit has been important in highlighting the opportunities that exist as we progress on our sustainability journey.

INNOVATE FOR THE FUTURE 
COLLABORATION 
The next era of sustainable business will be defined by more meaningful collaboration – with businesses working alongside government and civil society to identify the innovation that is required for sustainability.  We recognize that we are unable to meet our sustainability commitments by acting alone.  In the search for solutions,  we will be more effective by looking outside our own operations and by working in partnership across our entire value chain.  For this reason,  collaboration runs through all our sustainability activities.  As part of our 'Recycle for the Future' program,  we continue to forge partnerships to increase recycling.  We have worked closely with the University of Exeter to understand recycling behavior and have launched a recycling challenge in partnership with OpenIDEO (see case study below).  Supplier collaboration is also a key component of our sustainability strategywhether in pursuit of low-carbon innovation within our manufacturing plants or in developing energy-efficient vendors and coolers.  We are also working closely with many different NGOs and community organizations.  Projects include our river replenishment work in Great Britain with 
WWF-UK (see Factsheet 22) and our active lifestyle partnerships with the Norwegian Red Cross,  the Swedish Swimming Federation and Special Olympics (see Factsheet 11).  ACCELERATING THE PACE OF CHANGE 
To support our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by a third and to create a step-change in recycling in two of our markets,  we have established two new joint business ventures.  Working with ECOPlastics in Great Britain and APPE in France,  we have invested over $18 million to create two new state of the art recycling plants,  Continuum in Great Britain and Infineo in France.  As a result,  at the end of 2013,  we were able to include an average of 32 percent recycled plastic (rPET) in our PET bottles (see Factsheet 20).  We have also furthered our water stewardship agenda by trialing innovative new water-saving technologies including the use of electro-chemically activated water and dry and semi-dry lubricants on our manufacturing lines (see Factsheet 21).  
Recycle for the Future 	 Better information is needed to address common misconceptions about recycling.  	 There is an opportunity to leverage the 'power of community' through digital communication to encourage new recycling habits.  
In 2013,  we commissioned the University of Exeter to undertake a pioneering six-month study into recycling behaviors in the home.  The study observed 20 households in Great Britain and France to help understand the barriers to at-home recycling.  The study discovered that: 	 People don't make conscious decisions about recycling.  	 New thinking is required to help people form new habits.  
Sustainability Innovation Summit 
Given the scale of the sustainability challenges we face,  we recognize the importance of accelerating the pace of change.  This will include consideration of how we can use innovative new business models.  
CASE STUDY 
Recycling is something in which everyone has a role to play.  It is arguably one of the easier ways to contribute to protecting the environment.  However,  recycling rates in two of our territories Great Britain and France still fall short of the European average.  
CASE STUDY 
In April 2014,  we used the findings from this work to launch a new online recycling challenge in partnership with OpenIDEOan online open innovation platform.  The partnership enabled CCE to draw inspiration from a wide variety of sources and generate a range of ideas and solutions to encourage consumer recycling at home.  Ideas will be evaluated by the OpenIDEO online community and an Expert Advisory Panel,  including representatives from Casino,  WRAP and Fostplus.  We aim to select at least one winning idea to bring to life through a prototype,  field-test or full project launch.  See more at www, openideo, com/challenge/ recycle-challenge 
In October 2013,  we held our first Sustainability Innovation Summitinviting an international group of influential stakeholders to explore how business can use innovation and technology,  embrace new business models and think differently as part of the shift to a low-carbon economy.  The event was attended by more than 250 delegates including policy-makersNGOs and industry leaders.  Attendees heard from a range of entrepreneurial and pioneering speakers from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,  McKinsey & Co.,  Goldman Sachs,  IBM and Salesforce, com.  The Summit explored how organizations can drive the next era of sustainable business and the important role that collaboration will have to play.  Our keynote speaker,  Peter Schwartz from Salesforce, com,  also highlighted the important role of technology.  He said,  'The question of how we deploy technology is quite fundamental to the question of sustainability. " Summit breakout sessions explored topics directly related to CCE is core business including 'packaging of the future' and 'how to drive consumer behavior change on recycling'.  The Summit provided an important opportunity for CCE to hold a wider discussion about the role of business and enable like-minded organizations to share ideas and explore opportunities for collaboration.  'Today,  we are responsible for working outside of conventional boundaries and convening and leading a conversation that will help to shape the future of our business and also the world around us, " said Hubert Patricot,  Executive Vice President and President,  European Group,  Coca-Cola Enterprises.  Video highlights from the Summit can be found on www, cokecce, com We will hold our second Sustainability Innovation Summit in October 2014.

OUR STRATEGY 
We will provide a wide variety of quality,  refreshing beverages with nutritional and ingredient information so consumers can make informed beverage choices.  INTRODUCTION 
We are fully engaged in the debate on obesity and the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate.  While no single food or drink is responsible for obesity,  all calories count,  including those in our products.  Obesity is a complicated problem.  We are committed to playing our part and helping people find the right energy balance in their daily lives,  balancing calories consumed and calories burned.  We are taking action by providing a wide range of product choicesincluding no- and low-calorie beverages in a variety of packaging sizes with clear nutritional information.  We are also helping people to get active (see Factsheet 11).  
of our full-sugar brands have no- or low-calorie alternatives1 
of our products are in small portion sizes (250ml packs or less) 
		 CCE is full sugar brands,  excluding water and hot drinks.  Including water and hot drinks brands,  this equals 56%.  Our most popular sugar brands (Coca-Cola,  Fanta,  Sprite) all have low-calorie alternatives and together these make up 90% of CCE is volume.  
Our product portfolio strategy has three priorities: 	 Offering greater choice: we are introducing new products,  reducing calories and sugar across our range of products and raising awareness of no- and low-calorie alternatives.  	 Providing more information: being open about the calories and ingredients in our products through clear guideline daily amount labeling (see Factsheet 10).  	 Ensuring that our products are sold and marketed responsibly (see Factsheet 10).  DEVELOPING OUR PORTFOLIO 
We manufacture and distribute beverages owned by other companies.  To ensure a successful,  balanced portfolio,  we work with The Coca-Cola Company and our other brand owners to develop and introduce new products and package sizes in line with our strategy.  We try to ensure that each outlet has a range of choices available.  Our core sparkling brands such as Coca-ColaFanta and Sprite represent 29 percent of the products in our portfolio.  We also have a wide range of no- and low-calorie soft drinks from Diet Coke,  Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero to alternatives for the majority of our flavored drinks (nearly every one of our full-sugar sparkling soft drinks has a low-calorie alternative).  The rest of our portfolio consists of categories such as waters,  sports drinks,  functional waters and energy drinks.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
PRODUCT PORTFOLIO 
In 2013we introduced 375ml Coca-Cola,  Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero bottles and 250ml slimline cansexpanding our range of pack sizes to help consumers manage their calorie intake.  
Choice We offer a wide product and packaging choice so that people can decide which of our beverages best meet their needs and lifestyles and we work with The Coca-Cola Company to encourage people to make choices which balance their nutritional needs.  The Coca-Cola Company is also using the power and reach of its advertising to raise awareness and provide information about the calories in our products and what people need to do to expend these.  The 2013 'Be OK' advertisement puts calories front and center of brand communications to consumersconveying that each can of Coca-Cola has 139 calories and giving examples of some of the physical activities needed to burn these off,  as well as promoting Coca-Cola Zero as a no-calorie alternative.  The 'Grandfather' advertisement encouraged our consumers to adopt a balanced lifestyle by taking the stairs and eating smaller portions,  as our grandparents used to do.  The Coca-Cola Company will continue to promote the importance of energy balance and active lifestyles in its 2014 advertisingparticularly in conjunction with Coca-Cola is sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup™ in Brazil.  At CCE we continue to invest with The Coca-Cola Company to develop grassroots active lifestyle and sports programs in every market in which we operate to ensure we are helping people to get active in their communities (see Factsheet 11).  
We continue to increase these percentages by introducing reformulated versions of our popular drinks,  by expanding sales of our existing low-calorie products,  and by ensuring that no- and low-calorie products are consistently distributed alongside our regular soft drinks.  Since the European Union approved the use of the naturally sourced,  zero-calorie sweetener,  stevia,  in 2011,  we have started to use it in products such as Sprite and GLACEAU vitaminwater.  We will continue to explore opportunities to expand our portfolio using stevia.  In 2013,  no- and low-calorie reformulations of existing products and additions which help us to promote healthy choices included: 	 Sprite with stevia in Great Britain.  	 Monster Absolute Zero.  	 GLACEAU vitaminwater,  reformulated with stevia for 30 percent less sugarand more recently with zero calories.  Since 2012,  the Coca-Cola System in Great Britain has voluntarily supported the British Government is calorie reduction initiative,  alongside a number of leading food retailers,  restaurant chains and food and drinks manufacturers.  The initiative is a key part of the Public Health Responsibility Deal,  enabling the Government,  industry and health groups to work together to tackle complex health challenges such as obesity.  We have pledged that we will reduce the CASE STUDY 
New slimline 250ml can 
Quality We want to ensure that consumers trust our products and are satisfied with the quality we offer.  All our 17 production facilities are accredited to the quality standard ISO 9001 and Food Safety Standard FSSC 22000 and we have response centers in every country to constantly monitor consumer feedback.  In 2013,  we received 115086 consumer contacts of which 13 percent were related to product quality.  This is equivalent to 124 product quality complaints per million units sold,  a reduction of nearly five percent since 2012.  
No- and low-calorie beverages 541 percent of the brands we sell have noor low-calorie alternatives.  Including water and hot drinks these alternatives make up 31 percent of the volume of drinks we sell3.  
In 2013,  Coca-Cola introduced a new slimline 250ml can for Coca-ColaDiet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero in Great Britain,  France,  BelgiumLuxembourg,  and Sweden.  This new pack has been introduced in addition to the standard 330ml can and reflects our commitment to offering consumers a greater choice in terms of calories and portion size.  In Great Britain,  this initiative forms part of our commitment to the UK Government is 'calorie reduction pledge' a voluntary initiative by food and drink businesses to help tackle obesity.

Smaller portion sizes Another way we help consumers to manage their calorie intake is to offer our drinks in smaller packages.  19 percent of our products are now available in units of less than 250ml,  such as our 150ml cansand we are looking to increase these smaller packaging choices.  In 2012,  we introduced 'pocket-sized' 375ml Coca-Cola,  Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero bottles to be sold alongside our 500ml bottles.  In 2013we launched a new 250ml can to help consumers manage their calories (see case study below).  We have also limited our cup sizes for fountain beverages in France and Belgiumwhere we no longer sell branded cups larger than 500ml in restaurants,  leisure parks and most cinemas.  CASE STUDY 
ESFA reconfirmation of aspartame safety Low-calorie sweeteners,  if used consistently to replace caloric sweeteners,  can contribute to weight loss and maintenance,  and are important tools in the effort to tackle obesity.  Aspartame is one of the sweeteners we use in no- and low-calorie products such as Diet CokeCoca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero.  It has been used in many everyday products,  including confectioneryyogurt and soft drinks,  for more than 30 years and is made from two amino acids that are also found naturally in high-protein foods like eggs and meat.  In December 2013,  the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its opinion on aspartame after a thorough assessment of scientific research on the sweetener,  answering a request by the European Commission to re-evaluate all food additives by 2020.  EFSA reconfirmed aspartame is safe and that there is no need to change the current Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for aspartame.  This opinion aligns with that of the World Health Organization and more than 200 international studiesmaking it one of the most thoroughly tested ingredients.

Responsible Sales and Marketing OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will ensure that our products are sold and marketed in a responsible way.  INTRODUCTION 
With the influence of our marketing comes responsibility and we take seriously the need to sell and market our products in a responsible way.

reinforced our commitment to being part of the solution to obesity.  This included television advertisements focused on the importance of energy balance in managing weight.  We will continue this messaging in future advertising.  CONSUMER INFORMATION 
Through UNESDA,  we have committed to provide nutrition information as well as on-pack calorie information per 100ml and/or individual serving size.  To make the right choices,  consumers need to know what their food and drinks contain and how this information relates to a balanced diet.  In 2007,  we were one of the first companies to introduce 'Guideline Daily Amount' (GDA) labeling and we are now moving to the new EU 'Reference Intakes' (RI) label.  GDA labeling currently covers 98 percent of the products we sell.  Our pack labels also include information on ingredients and nutrition.  We take advice from local and European Scientific Advisory Councils and make no health claims unless these are scientifically proven.  Product information is also available through websites,  care lines and consumer information centers in all the countries where we operate.  We also provide extra information about ingredients on pack labels to help consumers make the right personal choices.  For example,  our energy drinks carry a statement indicating that they are not suitable for children and pregnant and breast-feeding women,  specific groups for whom caffeine is not recommended.  ADVERTISING AND COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION

SCHOOLS 
As part of a global Coca-Cola policy and through UNESDA,  we have committed not to undertake direct commercial activity in primary schools unless requested by school authorities or parents.  Although each country in which we operate has different policies on the distribution of our products in secondary schools,  our commitments can be summarized as follows: 	 To ensure that a full range of beverages (including waters,  juices and no- and low-calorie products) is available in appropriate portion control sizes.  	 Non-branded vending: to include educational images and messages on vending machines to promote balanced diets and to respect the commercial-free character of schools.

Working towards world-class safety status in our manufacturing and sales operations.  	 Developing a well-being program to encourage our employees to live activehealthy lives.  This factsheet addresses the first priority – building and supporting a diverse workforce.  See Factsheet 14 for information on safety,  health and well-being.  FOSTERING A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE 
We seek to attract,  develop and retain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate.  We regard every employee as a valued member of CCE and are committed to supporting and developing each individual to help them achieve their potential.  At CCE,  our diversity and inclusion approach comprises three principles: 
Accountability Responsibility for diversity rests at all levels of the business.  We now have a Group Diversity Council chaired by two members of our Executive Leadership Team (ELT).  We have also created a detailed D&I scorecard to allow us to measure and benchmark progress across the business.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
DIVERSITY 
Every quarter,  the ELT,  led by our CEO John Brock,  reviews how each business unit and function is progressing against its D&I action plan.  In addition,  all members of our ELT have individual D&I performance objectives.  
Awareness and education Our D&I learning strategy has two aspects: offering a variety of D&I courses within our existing management training curriculum and building stand-alone D&I programs.  One of these programs 'Diversity is Everybody is Business' is a team awareness program,  supported by a D&I toolkit including videos,  a quiz,  a 360 degree questionnaire and employee self-assessments.  The aim is to reach all employees by the beginning of 2015.  In 2013,  we piloted our 'Inclusive Leadership' program to provide training in diversity management and gender balance for our top 500 leaders.  This will be rolled out in 2014.  Diversity and inclusion is also about developing and enhancing people is own skills.  We offer a variety of learning and development programs and every employee is encouraged to create an Individual Development Plan (IDP).  76 percent of employees have a plan in place.  Development opportunities and performance is also reviewed annually for all employees.  Our online CCE Academy offers training in many areas from leadership to commercialsupply chain and global functions.  In 2013 more than 11600 individuals completed one or more Academy courses and just under 70000 courses were provided.  This included more than 234600 hours of training an average of 20 hours per employee.  
Within our workplace We continue to improve our processesorganization and culture to further support diversity and inclusion.  Our 'Diversity in Action' program provides sites and functions with D&I check-ups and self-assessment workshops (see case study below).  Since its launch in 2012,  more than 500 people have been directly involved in the program.  In 2013,  the program reached 24 sitessurpassing our initial target of 16.  Feedback from participants has been very positive: 100 percent said they found it useful and 97 percent would recommend it to their peers.  We continue to review our HR processes from a D&I perspective.  To achieve greater representation for women,  we aim to have at least one female on both the candidate list and the interview panel for every open leadership position at CCE.  Our efforts are showing results.  Women currently make up 33 percent of our Board of Directors (25 times the European average1),  25 percent of our ELT (almost three times the average3) and 36 percent of our management and leadership bands an increase of 13 percent since January 2012.

The concept has proved so successful that other countries have drawn on the lessons learned and similar networks have now been set up for employees in Belgium,  the Netherlands,  SwedenNorway and the USA.  
Since 2012,  our 'Diversity in Action' program has involved more than 500 people in 24 sites across the business.  D&I check-ups and self-assessment workshops are provided on topics such as gender,  ethnicity and nationalityage,  disability,  sexual orientation,  religion and work-life balance.  
The Women is Network in Great Britain has proved extremely popular.  Meetings and events are open to men as well as women and are usually oversubscribed.  Like our other networks,  this is helping to continue the development of a more inclusive culture.  
Follow-up meetings take place every six months for two years to review progress.  In addition,  sites that participate in the program make D&I part of their management routines,  with a diversity scorecard reviewed at every local management meeting.  In Antwerpfollowing the self-assessment,  meetings were organized with female employees to identify opportunities to improve the work environment.

WORKPLACE WELL-BEING AND SAFETY 
Each year our sites are challenged to further improve their performance.  In 2013,  the most outstanding progress was in our site in Norway (see case study below).  To support this drive for continued improvement,  we have focused on the following safety initiatives: 	 Revising our safety standards to make them easier to understand and implement.  This has increased awareness and compliance,  changed people is attitudes to safety,  empowered employees to challenge unsafe practices and made individuals more aware of their role in setting and enforcing standards and safe behaviors.  	 Providing intensive,  week-long management training for safety teams in all territories.  Designed to raise competency levels,  these covered safety disciplines such as risk managementgovernance,  root cause analysis,  data

and information management and audit,  along with softer skills such as change management,  communication and culture.  	 Developing our Europe-wide health and safety training curriculum to consolidate and standardize our approach and provide training relevant to three levels of competence: awareness,  manager and practitioner.  	 Expanding our use and understanding of data,  recording accidents that result in treatable injuries and potential incidentscommonly referred to as near misses.  Investigating incidents of this type can highlight issues that need attention,  while providing greater insight into safety trends and helping to avoid more serious incidents all part of a greater emphasis on accident prevention.  
At the same time,  the plant re-launched CCE is safety standards while also developing a sharper management focus to eliminate accidents and change people is safety behavior.  From having one of the highest accident rates in CCE in 2012,  the plant has achieved more than 500 days without an LTA and is now one of the leading sites in CCE and the Coca-Cola System.  With such a successful step changethe safety team in Norway received our annual internal recognition award for CRS.  
	 Where possible,  providing access to health and fitness centers across our territories.  	 Running awareness campaigns to help employees to stop smoking.  In 2013,  we joined the Global Corporate Challenge (GCC) to encourage employees to walk,  cycle or swim their way to more active lives and will be joining it again in 2014 (see case study below).  
CASE STUDY 
Global Corporate Challenge 
	 Focusing on higher safety performance from our contractors by raising awareness of their responsibilities,  acceptable behaviors and our safety standards.  We intend to raise the bar among our network of suppliers,  contractors and partners.  Our strong safety performance was recognized again in 2013 with all sites in Great Britain gaining The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Gold Award.  EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING 
Following the purchase of our Norwegian plant in 2010,  significant investment was made in updating production methods and ensuring that existing equipment met higher standards.  
	 Offering flu vaccinations to all employees.  
We aim to promote a culture of well-being that empowers and encourages our employees to lead active,  healthy lives.  This means providing a healthy,  safe and positive environment so that employees are engaged at work and can concentrate on their performance.  As well as the protection afforded by our employee benefits,  we have,  in recent years,  developed a range of programs and tools to encourage employees to proactively manage their overall health and resilience.  These include: 	 Our Employee Assistance program,  a confidential information service to support employees who have work or personal problems such as bereavement,  stress or financial concerns.  	 Our Health Risk Assessments program which offers employees an analysis of their current state of health and support for areas they may wish to focus on.  	 A network of well-being champions to coordinate the roll-out of our well-being programs and engage our people in local initiatives.  	 Publishing health and well-being information on our HR portal'HeRe Online'.  
In 2013,  we joined forces with 'Get the World Moving' to promote the Global Corporate Challenge across our business.  The GCC aims to get people active in an easily accessible and fun way.  It is about team spirit and bringing colleagues together with a little friendly competition thrown in.  Designed for employees of all fitness levels,  the aim was for each team member to walk,  cycle or swim 10000  isteps' a day,  with participants able to update progress online or by using the GCC phone app.  Three hundred teams of seven people signed up to the challenge,  armed with pedometers and walking more than 16 million kilometers over a 16-week period,  an average of 13000 steps per person per day.  Of those surveyed,  over half reported losing weight and feeling less stressed.  The winning team,  Les Frappadingues (The Crazy Ones pictured above) from Dunkerque,  consistently achieved an average daily step rate of more than 27200.

Our estimated carbon footprint across our value chain 
Energy and Climate Change OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR OPERATIONAL CARBON FOOTPRINT 
We will reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by a third by delivering carbon reductions throughout our value chain.  INTRODUCTION 
We recognize the part we play in addressing climate change and the need for collaboration.  We want to grow a low-carbon business and inspire our customers and suppliers to lead change for a more sustainable tomorrow.  Since 2007,  we have reduced the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by nearly 18 percent.  52 percent of emissions within our value chain comes from our packaging.  Of this 60 percent is from our cans and 20 percent from our plastic (PET) bottles.  Our sustainable packaging and recycling targets support our value chain carbon commitment and we are focused on working with our suppliers to further reduce these impacts (for more information see Factsheets 7,  19 and 20).  This factsheet focuses on our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our business operations.  
To support our value chain commitmentwe set a target to reduce the absolute carbon footprint of our business operations by 15 percent by 2020,  from a 2007 baseline.  In 2013,  we met this target seven years early with an actual reduction of 23 percent.  We plan to continue our efforts to maintain this achievement as we grow our business.  OUR STRATEGY 
Our strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of our business operations focuses on three themes: 	 Measuring and managing our carbon footprint.  	 Setting supporting targets and developing carbon reduction roadmaps.  
CCE is Business Operations 2007-13 
	 Driving innovation,  collaboration and technology.  
CO2e tonnes 
CCE is business operations (manufacturingdistribution and refrigeration) represent 31 percent of our value chain carbon footprint.  This was 658203 tonnes of CO2e for the period January 1,  2013 – December 31,  2013.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
The carbon footprint of our business operations is calculated in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes manufacturing processesfacilities,  fleet,  offices,  cold drinks equipment and our business travel.  We measure emissions from these activities in our eight Western European territories and our offices in the United States and Bulgaria.  Our baseline year is 2007 and our emissions are independent of any greenhouse gas trades.  We use an operational control consolidation approach to determine organizational boundaries.  Data is consolidated from a number of sources across our business and is analyzed centrally.  Under the Protocol,  we measure our emissions in three  iscopes'.  	 Scope 1: Direct sources of emissions such as the fuel we use for manufacturing and our own vehicles.  
	 Transport fuel calculated based on actual liters used or kilometers recorded.  
recycling,  water and wastewater from our sites and the fuel used by our thirdparty distributors.  
MEASURING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT 
We measure and seek to reduce our Scope 3 emissions (those that do not occur at our business operations but result from our business) because they are significantly greater than our Scope 1 and 2 (core) emissions.  The carbon footprint of our business operations in 2013 is verified in accordance with the GHG Protocol by SGS.  SOURCES OF DATA 
	 Energy data from metered sourcessupplier invoices and estimates based on floor size.  	 Refrigerant gas losses from contractors' re-gasing invoices.  	 CO2 fugitive gases from measuring our stock levels and subtracting the quantity of CO2 used in our products and in wastewater treatment.  
	 Scope 3: Indirect sources associated with the electricity used by our coolers and vending machines at our customers' premises,  our business travel by rail and air,  emissions associated with waste 	 Cold drinks equipment calculated based on supplier energy consumption rates and by subtracting savings from carbon reduction initiatives for the reporting time period.

ENERGY USE 
We use a variety of sources of energy in our operations which all contribute to our carbon footprint.  Our energy use in 2013 was as follows: 
CCE Energy Sources and Use 2013 (MWh5) Direct energy consumption by primary energy source 
Total natural gas used Total LPG used Total Light Fuel Oil used Total Diesel and Petrol used Total Biofuel used 
Indirect energy consumption by primary energy source 
Total electricity purchased and used Total heat purchased and used Energy used in cold drinks equipment Energy from renewable or low-carbon sources 
4. 	Please note we do not have PFCs or SF6 emissions.  5. 	Energy data expressed as MWh in line with CCE is internal reporting processes and KPIs.  
Since 2010,  CCE has used a Carbon Allowance setting process to establish annual carbon reduction targets.  Allowances are agreed for each business unit in line with our business plans.  Carbon reduction plans and road maps are developed and progress is monitored and reported quarterly.  For more information on our energy and renewable energy,  cold drinks equipment and distribution carbon reduction planssee Factsheets 16,  18 and 17.  
The carbon footprint of CCE is business operations in 2013 was 
The raw data collected is converted to carbon equivalents (CO2e) using emission factors or Global Warming Potential factors: electricity (IEA 2011),  non-electrical (DEFRA 2013) and district heating from suppliers.  Two percent of our operational carbon footprint is estimated.  MANAGING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT 
We use a variety of methodologies to gather our emissions data: 
	 Scope 2: Indirect sources of emissions such as the purchased electricity we use at our sites.  
	 Supply of water,  treatment of wastewater and waste management calculated by using liter and kg data respectively.  
tonnes of CO2e 
CASE STUDY 
Carbon Disclosure Project We report our carbon emissions publicly via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and are listed in the CDPs S&P 500.  The CDP is a not-for-profit organizationencouraging transparency and public disclosure of companies' environmental footprint and improvement actions.  We operate a company-wide carbon accounting system,  reporting both our core operations and value chain footprint.  In 2013,  we took this approach one step further,  piloting the new GHG Protocol is Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) standard.  Using the new methodologywe expanded our understanding and highlighted packaging,  ingredients and our core operations as our key focus areas,  confirming our value chain approach.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
Since 2007,  we have reduced our energy use ratio by 15%.  Our total energy use has risen by only 2% during a period when our production increased by 9%.  
Energy and Renewable Energy OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will manufacture every liter of product with 50 percent less carbon emissions and source 35 percent of manufacturing energy from renewable and low-carbon sources by 20201.  INTRODUCTION 
We have set rigorous targets for reducing emissions across our value chain and are determined to help secure a low-carbon future.  The carbon emissions resulting from our manufacturing plants are associated with the energy we use to make our products.  We continue to make our manufacturing more energy-efficient.  In 2013,  we invested $57 million in new energy-efficient production lines and equipment and an additional $7 million in further carbon reduction projects in our production plants.  
Energy use ratio (kWh/1000 liter)

	 2020 target assumes inclusion of grid renewable energy.  2	 Including Norway and Sweden from the year 2010 onwards.  3	Energy data expressed as MWh in line with CCE is internal reporting processes and KPIs.  
In our manufacturing operations,  our low-carbon strategy focuses on improving energy efficiency and using alternative energy sources by: 	 Managing the energy we use and adopting best practices and behaviors.  	 Investing in new and improved energy-efficient equipment.  	 Investing in renewable and low-carbon energy sources,  where possible.  ENERGY USE 
Seventy percent of the carbon footprint of our manufacturing and distribution sites is due to electricity and gas use.  In 2013,  the total energy use in our operations was 496610 megawatt hours3 (MWh),  an increase of two percent since 2007 despite a nine percent increase in production.  We monitor energy efficiency by calculating the energy needed to produce a liter of product our energy use ratio.  In 2013,  we used 7683 kWh/1000 liters,  a reduction of nearly six percent since 2012 and 15 percent since 2007.  ENERGY MANAGEMENT 
Ensuring we manage our energy and carbon emissions is fundamental to our approach.  We operate energy management and monitoring processes across CCE.  We have invested in monitoring and targeting systems and energy metering.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
ENERGY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY 
These provide operators with live data to monitor and benchmark our energy use and identify opportunities for improvement.  In 2014,  we will be investing in advanced systems which link directly to our production software.  
This has reduced energy consumption by 25 percent and,  in Great Britain,  has reduced the carbon footprint of our ovens by more than 50 percent.  
We are implementing our top five energy saving best practices and have rolled out The Coca-Cola Company and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Energy Savers program.  Six of our plants (Antwerp,  Gent and Chaudfontaine in Belgium,  Marseille and Toulouse in France and Dongen in the Netherlands) have been awarded the program is 'Energy-Savers' certificate.  
Just under four percent of our manufacturing energy is from renewable and low-carbon sources,  saving more than 3500 tonnes of CO2e annually.  We plan to increase this in the future.  Current and planned projects include: 
We have also piloted the energy management standard,  ISO 50001,  at Wakefield and East Kilbride,  Great BritainDunkerque,  France and ChaudfontaineBelgium.  This has helped identify further opportunities which we will share across our sites.  We have been recognized as one of the leading performers in carbon management by The Carbon Trust and in 2013 again received The Carbon Trust Standard across all of our operations.  INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY 
We continue to invest in process innovation and energy-efficient technologies to conserve energy.  We have developed centrally-led projects,  concentrating on areas of high energy use plus site-specific initiatives to address local opportunities.  Recent projects include: 
Bottle blower optimization We have rolled out a company-wide upgrade,  installing the latest technology to reduce the energy used to blow our PET bottles.  We are reducing the standard air pressure needed and installing air recovery systems.  We have also installed ceramic reflectors to optimize the heat generated within our ovens.  
LED energy-efficient lighting In 2013,  we continued to install energy-efficient LED and intelligent lighting systems in our sites and plan to fit more in 2014 (see case study).  
Packaging oven optimization In 2013,  we completed our multi-site project in Belgium and Great Britain converting electric packer ovens to use gas as a heating source to shrink film for bottle or can packs.  The program also involved installing roller shutters and oven  isleep mode' systems.  
ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY 
District heating District heating provides significant efficiencies by enabling businesses and homes to use a centrally generated source of heat.  However,  district heating is only available in some of the areas in which we operate.  In Norway and Sweden we have linked our sites to district heating systems fuelled by biomass,  drawing 25 percent and 36 percent of their energy respectively from this source.  
Turning waste heat into energy At our Dongen plant in the Netherlandswe are working with the Ardagh Group to test and investigate whether we can capture and use waste heat produced by Ardagh is glass production plant at our own manufacturing site located next door.  
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) CHP systems produce both electricity and heat from one energy source,  resulting in lower carbon emissions.  CHPs,  howeverare not suitable for all sites as they require sufficient demand for power and heat.  We have investigated the feasibility of installing CHPs at all our sites and identified our largest plant,  Wakefield in Great Britain,  as offering the most opportunity.  We plan to start installation in 2014.  
Solar photovoltaic We have installed solar photovoltaic panels in Great Britain at Edmonton,  Sidcup and Wakefield.  In 2013,  we also installed a solar panelled car port,  linked to electric car charging points at our new head office in Uxbridge,  Great Britain.  
Wind Wind turbines require sufficient wind and land to be a possible alternative energy source.  We have surveyed our sites and invested in detailed tests where opportunities were identified.  Plans and further investigations are being developed for our Dongen plant in the Netherlands.  
CASE STUDY 
Heat recovery from air compressors At our Sidcup plant in Great Britainwe have developed and installed a new heat recovery system on our low pressure and high pressure air compressors.  In a compressor,  heat is generated.  This has to be removedwhich requires energy.  Instead,  we have installed heat exchangers to capture the waste heat,  which reduces the energy needed and enables the heat to be used for cleaning networks and site heating.  
CASE STUDY 
Energy-efficient LED lighting We have invested in LED lighting and intelligent management systems in many of our sites.  These include our production plants in Sidcup in Great Britain and Grigny and Clamart in France and at our distribution center in Northampton,  Great Britain.  The new systems offer significant energy savings as well as higher quality lighting,  longer lifespans and better control.  For our Northampton site,  the savings are predicted to halve the site is electricity use.  
Saving energy,  sharing knowledge 'Collaborating with different teams has enabled us to share knowledge and identify energy-efficient ideas and innovations across the entire operation.  It is great to find solutions at a site level that can be rolled out to other plants and make a real difference. " Peter Johnson CCE Asset Care Systems,  Professional,  Sidcup,  Great Britain

Transportation and Distribution OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will deliver a case of product with 20 percent less carbon emissions by 2020 than in 2007.  INTRODUCTION 
Transporting our product is one of the smallest elements of our value chain carbon footprint,  accounting for seven percent of the total.  However,  we drive more than 106 million kilometers a year,  which makes it important to continue to reduce our kilometers and find new,  less carbon-intensive ways of distributing our products.  Our aim is to grow our business but not our carbon.  Delivering products effectively and efficiently is central to how we operate and achieve this objective.  We are developing our use of alternative technologies and fuels which now account for 5% of our kilometers driven.  
We are working with our customerssuppliers and logistics partners to reduce our carbon emissions and the number of kilometers driven to deliver our products.  
We aim to drive down our carbon per case delivered.  
million kilometers saved due to backhauling initiatives 
In 2013 we achieved a 
reduction in CO2e (grams) per case delivered since 2007.  
We focus our efforts on three key areas: 	 Driving fewer kilometers by optimizing our logistics network.  	 Working in collaboration with our customers and suppliers to remove road kilometers through techniques such as backhauling.  	 Reducing the carbon emissions of every kilometer driven by improving vehicle efficiency and by encouraging the adoption of alternative technologies.  NETWORK OPTIMIZATION 
Working to optimize our network is fundamental to reducing our carbon emissions.  Our aim is to operate the most efficient and effective distribution network by identifying opportunities to minimize and remove kilometers driven.  This involves three main activities: 	 Maximizing local production and deliveries direct from our production sites.  	 Collaborating with suppliers to understand opportunities for greater efficiencies.  	 Working with our customers to optimize our routes to market.  We continue to develop and expand local capacity and storage at our plants,  reducing the need for long-distance freight.  Recent projects include capacity investment in Clamart and Marseille in France,  Edmonton and Wakefield in Great Britain and OsloNorway,  as well as increasing storage capacity with automated warehousing at 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION 
our sites in Wakefield,  Great Britain and Dongen in the Netherlands.  In working with our suppliers,  we consider how materials are delivered to our factories.  To minimize transportation,  many of our sites are located alongside our can suppliersenabling the cans to be delivered directly.  Similarly,  all our PET bottles are blown on site and in recent years we have invested in PET bottle preform manufacture in-houseeliminating the need for transportation.  Cutting kilometers from factory to customer involves collaboration both with our customers and across different parts of the business,  from sales forecasting,  production planning to route design and vehicle scheduling and utilization.  This is underpinned by robust management practices,  shared KPIs and joint reporting processes.  In 2013,  we achieved a 171 CO2e (grams) per case delivered which is a reduction of 12 percent since 2007.  Network optimization projects in particular,  saved more than 5470000 road kilometers and 5400 tonnes of CO2e.  BACKHAULING 
We continue to expand our backhauling systems,  ensuring where possible,  that trucks are loaded on both the outward and return legs of a delivery in order to reduce empty journeys (see case study below).  In 2013,  our backhauling initiatives removed two million road kilometers and 1900 tonnes of CO2e.  ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND FUELS 
Close collaboration with our third-party hauliers,  which now account for the majority of our deliveries,  has led the way in adopting new carbon-reduction technologies and fuels.  In 2013,  these accounted for just under five percent of our distribution kilometers across Europe.  Recent developments include: 
Eco-Combis Replacing conventional diesel trucks with longer 'Eco-Combis',  capable of carrying up to 38 percent more per journey,  cuts down the number of road trips and reduces our emissions.  In the Netherlands,  we have expanded our use of Eco-Combi vehicles to a fleet of ten trucks,  reducing emissions per pallet moved by 22 percent.  
Bio- and dual-fuel trucks We continue to trial and introduce vehicles using alternative fuels.  In Sweden,  we have switched from fossil fuels to biodiesel with 75 percent of our trucks running on biofuel.  Increasing our use further is currently limited by our early adoption of vehicles meeting the vehicle air quality standard,  Euro 6.  
In the Netherlands,  we introduced the first Eco-Combi truck in the worldwide Coca-Cola System to be powered by dual-fuel.  We run a further ten standard trucks fueled by using landfill-derived biogas,  a form of energy produced from household waste.  We have also worked closely with hauliers in some of our other territories to trial dual-fuel vehicles.  In Sweden,  we operate 33 dual-fuel delivery trucks powered by a mix of 75 percent rapeseed-oil biogas and 25 percent regular diesel.  Until alternative fuels and truck technologies become more viablewe see dual-fuel vehicles as a key element of our sustainable distribution strategy.  
Electric vehicles Electric vehicles can offer benefits for regular,  shorter journeys but are limited by the weight they can carry.  We have trialed electric vehicles for GLACEAU vitaminwater deliveries in Paris,  France,  completing more than 1100 orders in 2013.  Similarly,  we are trialing the use of electric vans for inner-city routes in Oslo,  Norway and for our sales teams in Belgium.  We also use electric vehicles in our company car fleet.  
CASE STUDY 
We have used backhauling for many years to reduce our road kilometers and we continue to expand and develop new routes as new opportunities are identified.  Led by our customer logistics and routing teams,  our backhauling program is complex.  It requires close collaboration with customers or suppliers,  that typically have a site near one of our plants.  Project teams work together to combine deliveries with collections to avoid vehicles returning empty.  This way we save overall kilometers and reduce emissions while making our logistics more efficient and creating value for our partners.  We have backhaul arrangements with 28 major customers including TescoAsda,  Bookers,  Casino,  CarrefourSysteme U and similar arrangements with many of our suppliers such as those that supply our cans in Sweden and our pallets in Dunkerque,  France.  
Rail Where long-distance journeys are necessary,  we use multi-modal transport where trailers are transported by rail with only short truck journeys at each end of the route.  In 2013,  we celebrated our 4000th multi-modal rail delivery in France.  
Smaller trucks and company cars We are reducing emissions from our car and van fleet through a variety of measuresfrom introducing caps on CO2 g/km to trialing electric and dual-fuel cars.  Vehicle technology is improving with more low-carbon vehicles becoming available.  In 2013,  we reviewed the vehicles we offer our employees,  choosing models with the highest energy efficiency and safety standards and increasing the range of hybrid cars.  Since 2010,  we have reduced our car fleet is average CO2g/km by 18 percent.  In Belgiumwhere we use smaller trucks,  we limit their speed to 80km per hour,  which also saves fuel.  WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY 
To benchmark our progress and demonstrate our commitment to low-carbon vehicles and fuels,  we work with industry groups and have joined the Netherlands and Belgium Lean & Green program and the Centre for Sustainable Freight Transport in Great Britain.  We are also working with ADEME in France,  to help develop a carbon reduction charter and are part of the Haga emissions-reduction initiative in Sweden.  
Optimizing and driving our emissions 'Collaboration across our network has enabled us to identify a variety of opportunities and unlock carbon emissions savings,  from our internal teams focusing on reducing kilometers needed to deliver our products,  to developing customer and supplier backhauling partnerships and trialing alternative technologies.  Without working together in this way,  we wouldn't have been able to come up with the solutions we needed and achieve what we have. " Fabrice ZumerleCCE Senior Manager,  Logistics

Cold Drinks Equipment OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will reduce the carbon emissions from our cold drinks equipment (CDE) by an average of 35 percent and purchase only HFC-free coolers.  INTRODUCTION 
We have more than 572000 items of cooling equipment (coolersvendors and fountain machines) in the marketplace,  operated by our customers on their own premises.  Our cold drinks equipment fleet is one of the second largest source of carbon emissions in our value chain,  accounting for 17 percent of the total.  In the past four yearswe have invested more than $42 million in programs to reduce these emissions.  Since 2007,  we have cut the annual carbon impact of our cooling equipment by more than 170000 tonnes of CO2e.  This investment is saving approximately 50000 MWh of electricity for our customers each year.

GROWTH IN CCE'S COLD DRINKS EQUIPMENT (CDE) AND REDUCTION IN CDE CARBON FOOTPRINT Units 
We are installing energy management devices,  doors and LED lighting to reduce the carbon footprint of our cold drinks equipment.  
(2013) average CO2e per unit of equipment 
Our cooling equipment strategy has four priorities: 	 Collaborating with suppliers to purchase new,  more efficient equipment.  	 Installing energy-efficient technology to existing equipment during refurbishment and at our customers' premises.  	 Buying coolers that do not contain hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) greenhouse gas refrigerants.  	 Working with suppliers to develop technology and innovation.  NEW EQUIPMENT 
We have high standards for new equipment that we buy and install in our customers' premises.  We only purchase equipment that is at least 40 percent more energy-efficient than the equivalent equipment we purchased in 2000.  Since 2010,  we have not purchased large open-fronted units that use high levels of energy.  All new coolers with a capacity of over 250 liters also come with an energy management device.  We also specify low-energy LED lighting or no lighting at all if customers request it.  Where possible,  our new purchases come with Electronically Commutated (EC) fans and motors.  In addition,  we retrofit EC components at our customers' premises.

Energy management devices We are also fitting EMS-55 energy management device intelligent systems which recognize when a cooler is not being opened regularly and respond by shutting off lights and adjusting temperature.  This can reduce the unit is energy consumption by up to 35 percent.  Since 2010,  we have fitted 182000 EMS devices.  As a result,  65 percent of the relevant coolers and 47 percent of our vending machines now use this technology.  Where space does not allow,  we install the more compact EMS-25 Plus devicewhich also produces up to 35 percent energy saving.  In 2013,  we extended our program further by rolling out an energy management solution specifically designed for our fountain business (see case study).  
Programing our vending machines EXISTING EQUIPMENT 
Cooling equipment is refurbished several times to extend its working life.  We also continue to make existing coolers and vendors more energy-efficient.  Units are refurbished at six service centers across our territories,  while tens of thousands more are retrofitted with energy-efficient technology on our customers' premises every year.  In 2013,  we fitted energy reduction components to just under 44000 units.  These include: 
Fitting doors Fitting doors to our large,  open-fronted coolers reduces their energy use by up to 50 percent.  We have fitted doors to 62 percent of our open-fronted cooler fleet and aim to reach 75 percent by the end of 2016.  Of the remainder,  15 percent are in outlets where access prevents doors being replaced and 10 percent are models we will phase out.  We are also fitting doors to our smalleropen-fronted 'impulse' coolers.  We have converted 21 percent of the fleet so far,  with more than 2200 units upgraded in 2013and are planning to continue this program in 2014.  
More efficient lighting CCE has led the way in replacing fluorescent lights in coolers and vending machines with more efficient LED lighting which can cut energy consumption by up to 80 percent.  We are now installing 'tube' LEDs which are quick to fit and means less disruption for our customers.  We have so far fitted long-life LED lights to more than 133600 items of equipment,  (28 percent of applicable units) and plan to fit another 21800 in 2014.  
Some of our vending machines can be programed to save up to 25 percent of energy used.  We programed 2000 machines in 2013 and plan to complete this initiative in the coming years.  BECOMING HFC-FREE 
HFC refrigerants are potent greenhouse gases that can contribute to global warming if they leak or are released when equipment is disposed of in an uncontrolled manner.  We have made great progress in our transition to HFC-free refrigerants.  In 201050 percent of our cooler purchases were HFC-free.  By the end of 2013,  this had risen to 998 percent.  CCE is committed to purchasing only HFC-free coolers.  Where a commercial HFC-free solution is not currently availablewe collaborate with our suppliers to develop new HFC-free solutions.  We are now looking to accelerate the transition to HFC-free across the rest of our cold drinks equipment portfolio,  including vendors and fountain equipment.  To prevent leakage of HFCs from existing coolers,  our cooling equipment is maintained to high standards by our technical centers and field engineers.  We also have systems in place for safe disposal when equipment comes to the end of its useful life.  TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION AND INNOVATION 
We believe that further developments in innovation and technology have a significant part to play in meeting the sustainability challenges of the future.  We look to collaborate with businesses working at the forefront of this technology to find innovative solutions.  
CASE STUDY 
Energy management timer for drinks fountains In 2013,  we launched an energy-saving solution specifically designed for units used to cool fountain drinks in venues such as pubs and cinemas.  The device powers down equipment when the outlet is closed,  operating only intermittently to maintain drink quality and then powering up just before the outlet opens again.  The device prevents units running 24 hours a day and cuts energy consumption by up to 30 percent.  We installed 3300 of these devices in 2013 and plan to install up to 24000 over the next three years.  
Since January 2013 
of the coolers we have purchased have been HFC-free.  
Staying cool while reducing energy 'We work in the field engineering team in the Netherlands.  In 2013,  we replaced 5200 fluorescent lighting tubes with energy-efficient LED tubes,  which will last longer and use less energy.  We also deactivated the illuminated header in 1000 coolers,  replacing these with reflective,  non-illuminated graphics.  We are proud to be working with our customers to reduce energy consumption and helping to meet our 2020 commitments. " Peter van Huizen,  Jan Boddeman and Jan WagtCCE Field Engineering,  Netherlands

OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will set the standard for sustainable packaging,  achieve zero waste in our operations and recycle more packaging than we use.  INTRODUCTION 
Packaging is essential to safeguard the quality of our drinks and ensure their safe delivery to our customers and consumers.  It is also an important resource.  We are committed to supporting a circular economy by ensuring that maximum value can be gained from the use of resources.  Packaging can be carbon-intensive in its manufacture and despite the fact that nearly all of our packaging is recyclable,  it is often not recycled.  We estimate that packaging accounts for about half of the carbon emissions in our value chain.  Reducing our carbon footprint and optimizing resource use means looking at every aspect of our packaging from design,  material used,  weight and recyclability.

We continue to evolve and innovate our packaging to contribute to our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of the drink in your hand by a third by 2020.  Our strategy focuses on three core pillars: 	 Using less material for each product.  	 Using more recycled and renewable materials.  	 Making sure that our own packs are recyclable.  USING LESS MATERIAL 
We have a long-standing program of 'lightweighting' our packaging and continue to challenge ourselves to do more,  without affecting quality.  Our redesign process uses environmental assessment methodologies to identify opportunities to use less material and reduce carbon emissions.  We monitor improvements by tracking the average total weight of packaging per liter of product our packaging use ratio.  In 2013 we used 1198g/liter of product,  just over three percent less than in 2012 (1239g/liter).  In 2013,  lightweighting initiatives and the use of recycled and renewable materials reduced the carbon impact of our business by 21800 tonnes of CO2e.  These included: 	 Reducing the weight of our 500ml PET bottles from 247g to 217g in all territoriessaving 1500 tonnes of CO2e.  We plan a further reduction to 199g,  starting in Benelux and Great Britain,  saving another 1200 tonnes of CO2e in 2014.

Reducing the weight of our aluminum cans across our territories.  Our lightest 330ml cans are now below 10g and we are working to further lightweight all our cans.  	 Continuing to lightweight our can ends with successful rollout in Great Britain and France,  saving 1800 tonnes of CO2e.  Further rollout is also planned for Sweden in 2014.  	 Reducing the weight of our secondary and tertiary packaging,  by reducing plastic film weight and removing cardboard trays.  As a result,  just over 4000 tonnes of CO2e have been removed from our packaging footprint.  In 2014,  we plan to further reduce our large 15L,  and 175L PET packs in Great Britain from 417g to 403g and to develop the next generation of lightweight closures.  We will also continue to look for further packaging innovation and lightweighting opportunities.  USING RECYCLED AND RENEWABLE MATERIALS 
 crucial step in developing sustainable packaging and reducing our carbon footprint is to use more material from recycled and renewable sources.  
Recycled materials We believe recycled material can play an important role within a circular economy and are committed to increasing the amount of recycled material in all packaging types.  
CASE STUDY 
Lightest 330ml glass bottle Since 2005,  CCE and Ardagh Glass UK have been working to reduce the weight of our Coca-Cola,  Sprite and Fanta 330ml glass bottle.  Through various initiatives including investment in design technology and changes in the glass forming process,  the bottle now weighs 190g (a 21 percent reduction since 2005).  Recent reductions have saved a further 2100 tonnes of CO2e.

Secondary and tertiary packaging 
	 Aluminum and steel Recycling metals saves a significant amount of energy.  For example,  it takes 95 percent less energy to produce recycled aluminum than virgin aluminum.  We have made it a priority to increase the recycled content of our cans.  We are working with NGOs,  government,  industry bodies and local authorities to encourage consumers to recycle more and support campaigns such as Metal Matters,  'Happiness Recycled' at local festivals and in-store and online customer campaigns with retailers (see Factsheet 20).  We are also working with aluminum and steel producers and can manufacturers to make our cans more environmentally friendly.  	 PET Approximately 60 percent less energy is used in producing recycled PET (rPET) than the virgin material.  However,  recycling levels are lower for PET than for metals.  To address this,  we have invested in plastics reprocessing.  In Great Britain,  our joint venture,  Continuum,  is the largestmost sophisticated plant of its kind in the world.  In France our joint venture,  Infineohas increased the rPET plant capacity by 70 percent.  	 Glass Recycled glass is used in our bottles and we are working with our suppliers and waste management companies to increase the recycled content.  
Renewable material We have made progress in increasing rPET in our bottles.  However,  to reduce the use of virgin PET even further,  we have also looked to renewable sources.  In many of our products and territories we now use PlantBottle™,  a material containing up to 225 percent plant-based material and 25 percent rPET.  In addition,  now that our plant in Norway uses recyclable and non-returnable PET bottles,  we have increased our use of PlantBottle™ even further.  In 2013,  33 percent of all the PET bottles we produced were PlantBottle™.  
Both rPET and PlantBottle™ make a significant contribution to our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain.  We believe the best environmental solution is to use a combination of the two.  
Sustainably sourced cardboard The majority of the cardboard packaging we use comes from recycled sources.  That said a small proportion of virgin fiber is still needed for strength.  The source of this virgin material is important to us.  We are working with our suppliers to gain Sustainable Forest Management accreditation under the Program of Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).  By the end of 201390 percent of our cardboard had achieved accreditation.  To ensure a supply of good-quality recycled material and avoid our packaging going to landfill,  it is important to design for recyclability from the start.  By the end of 2013,  100 percent of our bottles and cans were recyclable.  Increasing rPET in our bottles 'Through collaboration with our suppliers and technical innovation,  we have been able to achieve an average of 32% rPET across all PET packs in 2013.  We use data and in-depth analysis to help to drive step by step improvements.  As a cross-company team,  we were able to bring together different business skills,  from commercial to technical,  to help achieve our goal.

Recycling OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will set the standard for sustainable packaging,  achieve zero waste in our operations and recycle more packaging than we use.  INTRODUCTION 
Packaging is an important and valuable resource,  but is often thrown away and discarded to landfill.  We are committed to supporting a circular economy,  whereby resources are recycled and re-used for as long as possible,  feeding back into the economy and ensuring we can obtain maximum value from our packaging.  In 2009,  we set ourselves a goal to recycle more packaging than we use by 2020.  We are working to promote recycling in the industry,  ensuring our packaging is recyclable,  investing in recycling infrastructure and using our brands to inspire and encourage consumers to recycle more.  Our work generates more recycled material to feed back into our own packaging,  reducing our carbon footprint and furthering the circular economy.  We have made significant progress in 2013ensuring that 84 percent1 of the packaging we use is recycledincluding recycling through our joint ventures.

opportunities for consumers to see CCE is recycling messaging 
Our recycling strategy has three pillars: 	 Consumer behavior and disposal: In collaboration with customersconsumers,  suppliers,  local authorities and communities,  we are using our assets and brand marketing to influence consumer behavior and inspire people to recycle more.  	 Collecting and sorting: We support existing collection schemes in the countries where we operate and will support specific programs to improve collections in countries with the lowest national recovery rates.  	 Re-use and reprocessing: By investing in recycling and reprocessing infrastructure,  we aim to ensure that,  by 2020,  the amount of packaging collected and reprocessed through national schemes and our own initiatives is greater than the amount of packaging we use.  CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND DISPOSAL 
Working with our customers and other stakeholders,  we are using our brands and a variety of marketing programs to raise awareness,  change people is environmental behavior and encourage recycling.  Programs in 2013 have included: 
Research and innovation We undertook a study with the University of Exeter to better understand recycling behavior in the home.  Over six months20 households in Great Britain and France

were observed to analyze the dynamics of recycling and waste disposal and explore ways of boosting at-home recycling.  We have used the findings to launch a new online recycling challenge,  in partnership with OpenIDEO,  aimed at inviting and developing ideas and solutions to encourage recycling in the home (see Factsheet 8 for more information).  
Partnerships with retailers During 2013,  we continued our partnerships with retailers and others to encourage consumers to recycle more.  In collaboration with Sainsbury is,  the Local Government Association and the UK is Waste Resources Action Program (WRAP),  we held a series of workshops for local authorities to raise awareness of cost-effective communications as a way of raising

In October 2013,  we opened a new education center at our Infineo recycling facility,  similar to the one already operating at Continuum in the UK.  Designed with input from Eco-Emballagesthe household packaging recycling organization for France,  and the Regional Ministry of Education,  the center explains the principles of the circular economy and the recycling of all types of packaging in an interactive and engaging way.  'The center will host around 5000 visitors a year and will seek to influence the environmental behavior of school students and the public to make the circular economy a reality, " said Professor Sylvie Faucheux,  Chancellor of the University of Burgundy.  
recycling rates.  With Sainsbury is we also ran an online 'Don't Waste.  Create' program to encourage consumers to reuse PET bottles in fun and useful ways before recycling them.  Running in partnership with Tesco,  our 'Together We are Making Recycling Count' campaign,  invited online visitors to make a recycling pledge in return for money-off vouchers.  More than seven million people viewed our online recycling messages and 37000 made pledges over the six-week campaign.  Similarly,  with Casino,  we ran 'Give a new life to your bottle',  an in-store and online campaign (see case study below).  
Promoting recycling in Milton Keynes Our 'Recycling for your Community' pilot in Great Britain was developed with Milton Keynes Council and UK Government Department for Environmental Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to help change recycling behavior on two local housing estates.  Working with five community groups,  the scheme used low-cost initiatives and behavior-change techniques,  from peer-to-peer communications to encouraging pledges.  Initial results show that recycling rates on both estates outperformed the rest of Milton Keynes.  The scheme also had a positive

Festivals and events In 2013,  we launched 'Happiness Recycled' at events such as RockNess and the Royal Highland Show in Scotland and Musilac music festival and Braderie de Lille in France.  Giant flower pots,  interactive bins and flash mob-style performers showed festival-goers how easy and fun it is to recycle.  COLLECTION AND SORTING 
To reduce packaging sent to landfill,  we are working with policymakers,  industry partners and national recovery schemes.  These include Eco-Emballages in FranceFost Plus in Belgium,  Nedvang in the Netherlands,  Returpack and REPA in SwedenNorsk Resirk and Rentpak in Norway and WRAP,  Zero Waste Scotland,  DEFRA and Valpak in Great Britain.  We are one of the founding members of The Resource Association and also support the plastics waste and resource management organization,  Recoup,  and the aluminum packaging recycling organization,  Aluproin Great Britain.  At our own operations we have been working to reduce waste going to landfill.  In 2013,  995 percent of our manufacturing waste was recycled and 14 of our plants achieved zero waste to landfill.  RE-USE AND REPROCESSING 
To ensure sufficient supplies of recycled plastic (rPET),  we have invested heavily in the infrastructure for the collection and reprocessing of materials in Great Britain and France.  Continuum Recycling in Great Britain,  our joint venture with ECOPlastics,  is the largest and most sophisticated plastic bottle reprocessing plant in the world and in 2013 celebrated processing its billionth bottle.  In France we have also opened Infineo,  a $12 million joint venture reprocessing facility with APPE.  This has increased the plant is rPET capacity by 70 percent,  along with the launch of a new education center (see case study).  As a result,  we were able to ensure an average of 32 percent recycled material in our PET bottles at the end of 2013.

Water Stewardship 
OUR STRATEGY 
OUR COMMITMENT 
We will set the standard for water efficiency,  establish a water sustainable operation and minimize water impacts throughout our value chain.  INTRODUCTION 
Water is one of nature is most precious resources.  It is critical to our communities,  our ecosystems and the sustainability of our business.  It is an essential ingredient in our beverages and central both to our manufacturing processes and to many of the agricultural ingredients we use.  We are committed to being responsible stewards of water and using as little water as possible for each liter of beverage we produce.  This factsheet focuses on our water stewardship programs within our own operations.  For information on water protection and replenishment and sustainable agriculture,  see Factsheets 22 and 23 respectively.  WATER USE RATIO PROGRESS 2007–2013 AND TARGET 1 Liters water used to make one liter of product 164

1. 	Including Norway and Sweden from the year 2010 onwards 
In 2013,  we used a total of 
86m cubic meters of water 
Our water stewardship program focuses on four strategic priorities: 	 Protecting our water sources for our operations and communities.  	 Reducing the amount of water we use by becoming more water-efficient.  	 Recycling the water we use by ensuring it is treated and returned to the environment at standards supporting aquatic life.  	 Replenishing the water that goes into our beverages in areas of water stress or where water quality may be an issue.  This factsheet focuses on priorities two and three.  For priorities one and four,  see Factsheet 22.  USING LESS WATER 
Ensuring a water-efficient operation is key to our water stewardship strategy.  In 2013,  our total water consumption was 86 million cubic meters (m3),  down 18 percent from 2012,  and our wastewater volume was 26 million m3,  down 9 percent.  Both were achieved despite increased production.  We monitor our water efficiency by calculating the water needed to produce a liter of product known as our water use ratio.  In 2013,  we used 135 liters/liter,  which was down 35 percent from 2012 (140 l/l) and 18% down from 2007 (164 l/l).  In 2014,  we aim to further reduce our water use ratio to 134 liters/liter and are committed to achieving 120 liters/liter by 2020.  
WATER STEWARDSHIP 
In 2013 we invested 
in water reduction technologies.  
of our wastewater was treated to standards1 supporting aquatic life.  
While we can't reduce the water in our products,  we can use less in our cleaning and manufacturing processes.  We have invested in water meters,  water mappingand monitoring and targeting systems and have developed process optimization techniques.  We operate company-wide water monitoring.  Targets are set annually and reduction options are identified and modeled.  We have also implemented a water savers program,  developed by The Coca-Cola Company and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  in the majority of our plants.  We are the most water-efficient bottler in the Coca-Cola System.  Our operations in France,  Great Britain and the Netherlands are ranked 1st,  2nd and 3rd respectively.  We have been awarded the Carbon Trust Water Standard and our operations in Dongen and Chaudfontaine were among the first beverage plants to receive the gold-level European Water Standard (see Factsheet 22).  Our operations in Wakefield also received Yorkshire Water is Chief Executive is Award (see case study).  RECYCLING THE WATER WE USE 
It is fundamental to us that we return the water we use to a high standard1.  In 2013we again met our commitment to ensure that 100 percent of our wastewater is treated to a standard which supports aquatic life.  While most of our plants pre-treat wastewater on site and then send it to municipal water treatment plants,  our facilities at Gent and Chaudfontaine in Belgium,  Wakefield in Great Britain and Marseille in France carry out full wastewater treatment on site.  Of our total waste water,  1890759m3 was treated by municipal wastewater treatment stations and 679085m3 by our own treatment plants.  Due to improvements in our water efficiencywe have reduced the amount of water that needs to be treated.  In 2013,  this was down by nine percent compared with 2012 and by nearly 28 percent since 2007.  1	In compliance with local regulations.

REDUCTION AND RECYCLING 
Technological innovation is an important pillar of our water reduction and recycling strategy.  We continued our program in 2013investing more than $300000 in piloting and implementing new technologies.  Recent developments include: 
Regeneration and re-use To purify the water for our drinks,  we use resin granules which need to be regularly regenerated and then rinsed.  After successful trials,  our Dunkerque plant in France now re-uses water from the rinsing process and saves around 15000m3 a year.  We plan to implement this approach in our plants in Sidcup,  Great Britain and Dongen in the Netherlands.  
Electro chemically activated water We have successfully trialled and installed electro chemically activated water at our Marseille plant,  in France.  This process electrolyzes salt added to water to create a chlorinated cleaning solution,  saving up to 2000m3 of water per year.  In 2014,  we plan to implement this technology in Grigny and Dunkerque in France.  CASE STUDY 
Yorkshire Water is top accolade 
Dry and semi-dry lubricants For conveyors which move cans and PET bottles,  we use dry lubricant instead of soapy water,  saving between 4000 and 8000m3 water per year (depending on the conveyor length).  We also use semi-dry lubricants for our stainless steel glass bottle conveyors at Antwerp,  in Belgium,  Dongenin the Netherlands,  Jordbro,  in Sweden and Clamart,  in France,  providing additional savings of over 4000m3 of water a year.  We plan to roll this out to our plants in Gent,  in Belgium and Marseille,  in France.  
Air rinsers When machinery is replaced or new lines are installed,  we use ionized air instead of water to rinse pre-blown bottles and cans.  73 percent of our plastic bottle and can lines now use air rinsers.  Where new air rinsers are not possible,  we are installing newefficient nozzles,  reducing water flows and introducing water recycling.

The award recognized our water stewardship,  our value chain approach and our consideration of impacts in water-stressed areas.  Kevin Barefoot,  Yorkshire Water is Business Services Manager,  said: 'The award recognizes the exceptional work that our customers undertake.  Their proactive attitude not only positively contributes to the sustainability of their business but to the sustainability of the Yorkshire region and much wider supply chain. " 
Bottle washers Bottle washing equipment in plants with refillable packaging is one of our main users of water.  We are investing in newmore efficient bottle washers and have developed a program of water optimization to reduce water use.  
Cleaning optimization We have optimized our cleaning processes – 'Clean in Place' (CIP) by using air rather than water where possible,  using cold water and recovering the water we use for reuse within our cleaning systems.  We have also installed rainwater harvesting systems to wash vehicles and flush toilets at our sites in Northampton,  Great Britain and at Chaudfontaine and Antwerp in Belgium.  
Saving water,  drop by drop 'Since 2007,  we have reduced the water we use by 18 percent,  while our production has increased by more than nine percentwhich is a great achievement.  Each employee has had a role to play,  sharing and implementing best practices and ensuring we have the right balance between investing in technology and challenging the way we do things.

Protecting and Replenishing the Water We Use OUR COMMITMENT 
OUR STRATEGY 
We will protect the future sustainability of the water sources we use and return to nature the water used in our beverages where it is sourced from areas of water stress by investing in community based water programs.  INTRODUCTION 
Water is one of nature is most precious resources.  It is critical to our communities,  our ecosystems and the sustainability of our business.  Although water is generally regarded as abundant in Europeincreasingly disruptive weather patterns are raising concerns of scarcity,  flooding and potentially unreliable water quality especially in more densely populated areas.  CASE STUDY 
Restoration and replenishment at the River Nar We are working with The Coca-Cola Company,  WWF-UK and the Norfolk Rivers Trust to restore water quality and local wildlife habitats in the River Nar catchment in Norfolk where a high proportion of the sugar beet used in our drinks in Great Britain is grown.  The project focuses on three core elements.  The first is to restore the Nar to its natural,  meandering state to help the river and the surrounding meadows work more harmoniously in times of flood and attract more wildlife.  
Secondly,  we are reducing agricultural pollution and build-up of river sediment by implementing silt traps and working with local farmers to adopt more sustainable farming methods.  Finally,  a river catchment management plan has been developed.  This explains the health of the river and sets out a roadmap of actions needed to restore it.  The project outcomes are encouraging and are being used to demonstrate what good river management can look like.  
We believe that being a water-sustainable operation involves four elements: 	 Protecting our water sources for our operations and communities.  	 Reducing the amount of water we use by becoming more water-efficient.  	 Recycling the water we use by ensuring it is treated and returned to the environment at standards supporting aquatic life.  	 Replenishing the water that goes into our beverages in areas of water stress or where water quality may be an issue.  This factsheet focuses on steps one and four those activities which take place outside our operations.  For information on steps two and three,  see Factsheet 21.  PROTECTING OUR WATER SOURCES 
We understand the value of water and the importance of protecting water sources and their quality.  The majority of the water we use (77 percent or 666 million m3) comes from municipal sources with only 23 percent (two million m3) from on-site wells all of which are licensed.  We are working hard to protect water for the future.  All our plants have undertaken Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVAs) to assess potential risks of water quality and availability for our business,  the local community and the ecosystem.  Taking a catchment-based approach,  the SVAs evaluate the local water resource systems PROTECTING AND REPLENISHING THE WATER WE USE

source water protection plans in place at all our manufacturing plants.  
current and historic water quality,  current water stresses and potential risks due to extreme weather conditions or natural disasters.  In addition to SVAs,  each of our plants has put in place Source Water Protection Plans (SWPPs).  The plans consider the conclusions of SVAs and future water needs of the plant to identity mitigation plans.  These plans are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  In recognition of our high standards of water use from extraction to wastewater,  our operations in Dongen in the Netherlands and Chaudfontaine in Belgium have been awarded the European Water Stewardship Standard at gold level (see case study).  CASE STUDY 
European Water Stewardship Standard – gold level Our site in Dongen,  Belgium,  was the first beverage plant to receive the gold-level European Water Stewardship (EWS) Standard for water protection and stewardship practices shortly followed by our site in Chaudfontaine,  Belgiumwhich was the first mineral water bottling plant to achieve the standard.  The EWS is a new standard which aims to help organizations align with the objectives of the European Water Framework Directive and go beyond site water management to actively respond to local water challenges.  Both sites had to demonstrate high levels of water conservation from extraction management and water reduction initiatives to wastewater management and working with local stakeholders.  Implementing the standard provided additional benefits at the plants and these will be shared across our manufacturing sites.  	See more at — www, ewp, eu

The Coca-Cola System is working globally to replenish or balance the water used in its finished beverages through community projects such as reforestation,  aquifer protection and river revitalization.  As part of this global approach,  we have chosen to focus on investing in replenishment programs in areas of water stress within our countries of operation.  Using water stress mapping,  we identified these areas to be Flanders in Belgium,  South East England and the South East of France.  Together,  our plants in these areas accounted for 375 percent of our 2013 production (nearly 24 million m3).  Our aim is to develop water-based community projects to replenish the water we use in our products from these areas.  
Replenishment projects Since 2012,  we have been working in partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and WWF-UK on a three-year water protection and replenishment project for two English rivers the Nar in Norfolk and the Cray near our Sidcup plant in Kent.  In each case we are developing local catchment plans and implementing on-the-ground projects to restore water and improve water quality (see case study overleaf).  Calculations indicate that since 2012 these projects have resulted in more than 157800m3 of water being replenished and habitats have been improved in an area of approximately four kilometers.  Lessons learned from these exemplar projects will be shared to encourage others to introduce measures to reduce water abstraction and demand and to raise discussion and debate to help develop national water policy.  
Replenishment in our supply chain Our studies show that around 80 percent of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural supply chain – in particular,  the production and processing of sugar.  For CCE,  a significant proportion of the sugar we use is from sugar beet.  We must consider the amount and the importance of the water we use.  A large water footprint might be sustainable in a water-rich area,  while a smaller one in a water-scarce region can have a far greater environmental impact.  In view of these geographical differenceswe have been working with our European sugar beet processors to develop bespoke standards supporting our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (see Factsheet 23).

We have been working with the local community,  the University of Liege and Walloon Regional Authority in Chaudfontaine,  Belgium,  on a large-scale project to protect the area is natural warm spring from pollution.  The water takes 60 years to filter through purifying rocks into the aquifer,  before emerging at the surface and attracting local visitors and tourists.  The local area has been surveyed and more than 1000 homes have been visited to identify potential risks.  Protection measures are being implemented to prevent potential pollution from a variety of sourcesfrom fuel tanks to livestock farms and sewage works.  In 2013,  the project was extended to 2015 with the aim of implementing 500 measures and investing a total of $17 million.  WWF and Coca-Cola 'WWF and Coca-Cola have a long history of working together around the world.  We are really proud of our work in the UK which is directly helping to reduce impacts on the freshwater environment while encouraging others to do the same.

We are working with The Coca-Cola Company and our sugar suppliers to ensure that our sugar is sustainably sourced.  
Sustainable Agriculture OUR COMMITMENT 
We will work with our sugar suppliers to ensure that by 2020 the sugar we use is sourced sustainably.  INTRODUCTION 
Inside every bottle of Coca-Cola indeed in many of our products – are agricultural ingredients that start on a farm.  Our business depends on the long-term availability of these products.  That said,  conventional agricultural practices can have serious environmental and social impacts.  The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has identified that agriculture uses over two-thirds of the world is fresh water.  At the same timeagriculture can be a leading contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and a primary driver of deforestation.  In our own value chain,  agriculture accounts for the largest share of water use and the third-largest share of carbon emissions.  At CCE,  we are working closely with The Coca-Cola Company to develop our approach to sustainable agriculture.  This includes an ambitious new goal for the global Coca-Cola System to  isustainably source key agricultural ingredients by 2020'.  For information on our broader sustainability work with our suppliers,  see Factsheet 7.  
OUR STRATEGY 
At CCE,  our focus is on ensuring that the sugar cane and sugar beet we use in North West Europe is sourced sustainably.  Working with The Coca-Cola Companywe have established a set of Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) and are developing partnerships with our sugar suppliers to ensure that our sugar is sustainably sourced.  In 2013,  we established an internal Sustainable Agriculture Steering Group to oversee this work.  Sustainable agriculture is now a key pillar in our sustainability journey and we will continue to develop our plans in this area.  SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
In 2013,  together with The Coca-Cola Company,  we launched our SAGPsspecifically for suppliers of agricultural ingredients.  The principles are designed to work in conjunction with our Supplier Guiding Principles (see Factsheet 7).  The principles set out what we mean by  isustainable sourcing' and include expectations and criteria that our suppliers will be expected to meet in terms of human and workplace rights,  the environment and sustainable farm management practices (see SAGPs overleaf).  At CCE,  we have shared our SAGPs with our suppliers of sugar beet and sugar cane and will work with them over time to ensure they are able to meet our criteria.

FOCUS ON SUGAR 
Our work to understand the water footprint of our value chain highlighted that sugar – taking account of farming,  processing and production can account for up to 80 percent of our value chain water footprint.  As a result,  our focus at CCE is on ensuring that the sugar cane and sugar beet we use in North West Europe is sourced sustainably.  Understanding the different sustainability issues and the supply chains of these two very different crops is central to our sustainable agriculture strategy.  
Sustainable beet At CCE,  a significant proportion of the sugar we use is from sugar beet a root crop grown widely in North West Europe.  In 2013,  we began working with The Coca-Cola Company and WWF to define the best practices for sustainable sugar beet farming in Europe and to identify a set of standards that support our SAGPs.  In collaboration with Europe is sugar beet processors,  we worked with the Sustainable Agricultural Initiative (SAI) Platform to develop a farm-level self-assessment tool – the Farmer Sustainability Assessment (FSA).  Following a pilot with a number of sugar beet farmers in Europe,  the FSA was formally adopted and we are now working with our sugar beet suppliers to roll it out.  
Sugar cane is a grass crop,  produced in sub-tropical areas.  Under the existing EU sugar regime,  around 70 percent of Europe is sugar cane imports are sourced from developing countries which have preferential trading relationships with the EU.  The Coca-Cola Company has played an important role in the establishment of Bonsucro,  a global standard for sustainable sugar cane production.  To accelerate our move towards sustainably sourced sugar cane in Europe,  we are working with The Coca-Cola Company to consider how sustainable agricultural practices can also be implemented in smallholder sugarcane farms.  In 2013,  we took our first step on this journey by working with the Rainforest Alliance to develop our understanding of the sustainability risks and current best practice in the sugar cane supply chain in Europe.  We will continue this work in 2014.

Sourcing sugar sustainably 'In 2011,  The Coca-Cola Company conducted a wide ranging water footprint sustainability assessment looking at sugar sourcing in Europe.  This served as the starting point of our journey on sustainable sugar beet.  We have since worked with our key suppliers and other food and beverage companies to define and harmonize our sustainability expectations for farmers.  The recently developed Farmer Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative allows farmers to assess the sustainability of their agricultural practices (covering environmental,  social and economic issues) and provides a basis for continuous improvement.

CASE STUDY 
Communicating our principles To introduce our SAGPs,  it was important to communicate them effectively across our supply base.  The principles were first shared with our sugar suppliers as part of our Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) process.  In December 2013,  in partnership with The Coca-Cola Company,  we also convened a virtual Sustainable Agriculture Conference to launch the principles with representatives from European suppliers of sugar beet and sugar cane.  Procurement and sustainable agriculture specialists from both CCE and The Coca-Cola Company explained our commitment to sustainable sourcing and outlined our plans to validate suppliers for compliance with our SAGPs from 2015.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
Independent Assurance statement Our scope 
Basis of our opinion 
Coca-Cola Enterprises commissioned DNV Two Tomorrows Limited ('DNV GL') to undertake independent assurance of its Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report 2013/2014 as published at www, cokecce, com for the following areas: 
 multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed work at Group level.  Our assurance work included the following: 
	 Coca-Cola Enterprises' corporate responsibility and sustainability performance data for the year ended 31 December 2013,  as published in the Diversity,  A Safe and Healthy WorkplaceWater Stewardship and Protecting and Replenishing the Water We Use factsheets; and 	 Coca-Cola Enterprises' self-declared Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) application level of B+ of the GRI 'G30' Guidelines as published in the full GRI index.  
Our approach We performed our work using DNV GL is assurance methodology which is based on our professional experience and international assurance best practiceincluding reference to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information'.  We used the GRI Quality of Information Principles to evaluate the performance data together with Coca-Cola Enterprises' data protocols for how the corporate responsibility and sustainability performance data are measured,  recorded and reported,  as the basis of the Reporting Criteria for undertaking our assurance work.  We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusions.  We are providing a 'limited level' of assurance.  A  areasonable level' of assurance would have required additional work at Group and site level to gain further evidence to support the basis of our assurance conclusions.  
	 Interviewing senior management responsible for the management of corporate responsibility and sustainabilitythe Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report 2013/2014 and selected data reporting systems; 	 Reviewing and sample checking the sustainability performance data measurement,  collection and reporting processes at Group level for the performance data in the factsheets in scope of this assurance engagement; 	 Reviewing how the sustainability performance data in scope of this assurance engagement are represented in the 2013 CRS Data Table; and 	 Assessing the GRI index for compliance with the GRI 'G30' application level requirements for B+.  
Responsibilities of the Directors of Coca-Cola Enterprises and of the assurance providers The Directors of Coca-Cola Enterprises have sole responsibility for the preparation of the Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Report 2013/2014.  In performing our assurance work,  our responsibility is to the management of Coca-Cola Enterprises; however our statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all of Coca-Cola Enterprises' stakeholders including its senior management.  We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the Report.  However,  having reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of the Report,  in a number of instances changes were made to the final version.  DNV GL provides a range of other services to Coca-Cola Enterprises,  none of which constitute a conflict of interest with this assurance work.  
Our key observations and recommendations We have provided a confidential Management Letter containing our observations and recommendations made during the course of our work to Coca-Cola Enterprises' senior management.  Without affecting our assurance opinion,  our overall key observations and recommendations are summarised below: 	 We restate our recommendation to Coca-Cola Enterprises to review the current suite of targets and KPIs to ensure they are aligned with the core business strategy.  We understand that this review is already underway,  and once completeshould establish targets and KPIs that are both challenging enough to the business and that address the expectations of customers and other key stakeholders.  	 We see an opportunity for Coca-Cola Enterprises to explore how to report in future on the direct and indirect socio-economic impacts of its operations.  The breadth of these impacts will be extensive,  ranging from economic development amongst upstream suppliers,  'knock-on' effects in the vicinity of manufacturing operations,  economic activity in the post-consumer value chainand the contributions made at a national level through taxation.  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2013/2014 
ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
Our key observations and recommendations relating to the factsheets in scope of this assurance engagement include: 
Diversity: 	 Coca-Cola Enterprises demonstrates a proactive approach to employee diversity and inclusion,  for example through the roll-out of 'Diversity in Action' and 'Diversity is Everybody is Business' programs.  Current activities and KPIs reported in the factsheets focus primarily on gender diversity.  We recommend Coca-Cola Enterprises should consider ways of expanding its reporting of performance for other diversity metrics,  such as disabilityethnicity and sexual orientation.  
Our conclusions On the basis of the work undertakennothing came to our attention to suggest that: 	 there are any material misstatements within the corporate responsibility and sustainability performance data for the year ended 31 December 2013,  as published in the Diversity and InclusionA Healthy and Safe Workplace,  Water Stewardship and Water Protection and Replenishment factsheets; or that 	 there is any material misstatements within Coca-Cola Enterprises' self-declared GRI application level of B+ of the GRI 'G30' Guidelines as published in the GRI index.  
 Safe and Healthy Workplace: 	 We restate our recommendation to Coca-Cola Enterprises to include safety performance for third party contractors in its future reports.  
for DNV Two Tomorrows Limited London 28 May 2014 
Water Stewardship & Protecting and Replenishing the Water We Use: 	 Coca-Cola Enterprises has made significant progress in these areas over the last year,  particularly in assessing what is required to replenish water usage within the context of local water catchment areas.  We recommend that Coca-Cola Enterprises should continue to explore the social dimensions of water protection and replenishment,  to provide a more detailed account of the benefits and trade-offs involved.  
Jon Woodhead Head of Department,  UK Sustainability 
	 We observed that Water Stewardship and Replenishment KPIs such as the Water Use Ratio and Water Replenishment are calculated by manually entering a significant number of data points from the master database.  Such manual manipulation of data risks introducing human error in the data entry and transposition of figures.  We recommend that Coca-Cola Enterprises considers establishing an automated system to capture data from the master database into their KPI calculation spreadsheets.
