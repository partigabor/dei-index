At the heart of PepsiCo is Performance with Purpose — our goal to deliver top-tier financial performance while creating sustainable value for all stakeholders.  
In practice,  Performance with Purpose means providing a wide range of foods and beverages from treats to healthy eats; finding innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment and reduce our operating costs; providing a safe and inclusive workplace for our employees globally; and respecting,  supporting and investing in the local communities where we operate.  
Wherever we operate,  Performance with Purpose is our guide.  We believe that delivering for our consumers and customers,  protecting our environment,  sourcing with integrity and investing in our employees are not simply good things to dobut that these actions fuel our returns and position PepsiCo for long-term,  sustainable growth.

Our Sustainability Reporting 
 PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
PepsiCo is pleased to share the progress we have made in 2013 on our Performance with Purpose journey.  This report outlines our sustainability goals and includes supporting data and examples of our efforts to achieve those goals.  Our companion Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) report provides greater detail on our 2013 sustainability activities.  An index providing a comprehensive list of topics covered by the GRI report can be found in the GRI Index on pages 64–65.  Additionally,  we regularly update the Performance with Purpose section of PepsiCo, com,  as well as our corporate social media channels,  with news and data regarding our sustainability efforts.  Please follow us on Twitter [at]PepsiCo and on Facebook at https://www, facebook, com/PepsiCo.  
Sustainability Governance The Sustainability Task Force,  chaired by the President of PepsiCo,  leads our corporate sustainability strategy development,  an integral part of our overall business objectives planning.  This effort is executed in partnership with leadership teams who oversee the three focus areas of Performance with Purpose: Human As part of this review,  an internal team identified approximately 175 possible social,  environmental and economic topics that could impact our business.  We then prioritized those topics based on their importance to our business and to stakeholders.  The results were used to select the topics covered in this report.  
This list of topics may change from year to year based on updated materiality assessments.  For further information about our materiality assessment and the full list of topics,  see our companion GRI report.  
In 2013,  PepsiCo was included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the eighth consecutive year and on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the seventh consecutive year.  
Materiality Stakeholder Engagement PepsiCo conducted a formal assessment to identify those matters that are most important socially,  environmentally and economically — both for our business and for our stakeholders.  This assessment of 'material aspects"¹ was conducted in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelinesa widely used comprehensive sustainability reporting standard issued by the Global Reporting Initiative organization.  This process of prioritizing the topics we report on helps us to make a more direct link between our growth strategy and the societal challenges we face as a responsible company in order to deliver long-term,  sustained growth.  Throughout the year,  PepsiCo regularly engages with our stakeholders on a wide variety of issues.  We listen carefully to,  and gather information and opinions from,  our employees,  shareholderssuppliers,  the communities in which we operateour retail service customers and consumers of our products,  as well as from regulatory agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).  
We count on our stakeholders across the globe to engage and partner with us on how we can continuously improve,  innovate and adapt.  This feedback is critical to our long-term success.  We emphasize engagement at every stage of operations with all stakeholdersincluding consumers,  customers,  communitiesemployees,  suppliers and investors.  In 2013,  we invested time and resources to evaluate and improve the mechanisms through which we engage stakeholder groups,  develop partnerships and evaluate customer satisfaction.  See the GRI report,  page 20,  for more information on this process.  As always,  we are deeply appreciative of all of our stakeholder partners who help us advance our sustainability goals in countless ways.

 PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
ceo letter When I first articulated Performance with Purpose seven years ago,  sustainability was often viewed as tangential to the businessor a program owned by a dedicated team.  But PepsiCo has shown how a clear,  focused sustainability agenda can be ingrained into a company is daily operations,  be a powerful rallying cry among employees,  drive strong performance and unlock shareholder value.  Performance with Purpose is not a defined set of issues,  a collection of goals or metricsor something of interest only to a select set of stakeholders.  It is quite simply the way all of us at PepsiCo do business to deliver sustained growth.  Performance with Purpose means just what it says.  It is delivering results in the right wayin a sustained way.  It means we live our values and do so in a way that fuels our performance.  We like to think of it as the way we strive to 'future-proof" PepsiCo.  
Let me explain.  Today,  we are a $66 billion company with products found in virtually every corner of the world.  But even with our sizewe see vast opportunity to grow and thrive in an evolving environment.  As we do soPerformance with Purpose is our guide.  The corporations that win in today is competitiveresource-scarce and hyper-transparent world are those that create real value for society.  They are those who see their success as inextricably linked to the success of the world around them.  That is why we see Performance with Purpose as the catalyst for our success.  It is our contract with society,  and it is also the driver of our innovation and our competitive advantage.  
CEO LETTER 
Let me give you some examples: 
We see Performance with Purpose as the catalyst for our success.  
Finally,  competition for top-tier talent has never been as great as it is today.  For PepsiCo to remain a leader that anticipates change in order to meet it,  we need to be among the world is best at attracting and developing talent.  Last year,  we revitalized our PepsiCo University program,  launching new skills and leadership trainings at every level of the company.  We also champion diversity and inclusion within our teams globally.  A more complex and fragmented marketplace requires a vibrant workforce armed with diversity of thought to meet the dynamic needs of our business and our world.  We continue to work toward our ambitious goals in all of these critical areas and recognize 
that collaboration is the best path to innovative solutions and progress.  If you have comments on this report and our Performance with Purpose journey,  we welcome them via email at performancewithpurpose[at]pepsico, com.  While it gives me great pleasure to publish this sustainability report detailing our progress and accomplishments,  in many ways it becomes more difficult with each iteration.  It is becoming harder to answer the questions: Where do the sustainability issues begin and end? What distinguishes sustainability performance from financial performance? When does sustainable business become 'business as usual?" At PepsiCo,  they are one and the same.  And we call it Performance with Purpose.

 PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
For a number of years,  we have seen a shift by consumers to more nutritious products,  a trend we believe is here to stay.  Consumers are increasingly looking for foods and beverages that offer nutrition and convenience without sacrificing taste.  Thanks to the range of products we offer and our world-class scientific capabilities,  PepsiCo is in position to meet this need.  In recent years,  we have invested in our healthy snacks in the areas of baked grainsdairy,  and hummus and fresh dips,  and we have built up our non-carbonated beverage portfolioincluding teas,  juices,  sports drinks and protein smoothies.  At the same time,  we continue to work on reducing sodium,  saturated fats and added sugars across our portfolio.  While in some respects,  this has proven challengingwe are focused on doing more.  To that endwe believe our aggressive investments in Research & Development will prove critical to meeting consumer demand,  unlocking new growth streams and keeping PepsiCo strong for the long term.  
As the global population continues to growand the middle class expands,  demand for finite natural resources is rising.  Capturing efficiencies in our operations through innovation is an absolute necessity.  In recent years,  we have positioned our business for the future by doing just that.  Water stewardship,  in particularis an area of intense focus for PepsiCo.  Having already met our 2007 goal to improve water use efficiency by 20 percent with a 2006 baselinewe are now looking to set more challenging goals to minimize our water usage.  And as a company that depends heavily on agricultural raw ingredients,  our Sustainable Farming Initiative — which helps growers increase yields and improve social and economic conditions while decreasing environmental impacts — is vital to our success.  We are pleased with,  and proud of,  our progress — but we are not satisfied.

This balanced portfolio includes 22 brands that generate more than $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales.  
Our developing and emerging markets,  a major investment area,  continued to perform well despite significant volatility in key regions.  As a group,  our developing and emerging markets posted strong organic revenue growth in 2013,  with particularly strong performance in China,  Pakistan,  Saudi Arabia,  Mexico,  Brazil and Turkey. ⁴ 
Our categories are also uniquely complementary.  The breadth of PepsiCo is food and beverage portfolio and the high coincidence of purchase between these two categories uniquely position us in the marketplace and to our customers and consumers worldwide.  For example,  in the U.S.  Building from our positions of strength with four of the most important nutrition platforms and brands — Quaker (grains),  Tropicana (fruits and vegetables),  Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes) and Naked Juice (super-premium juices and protein smoothies) — we continued to expand our portfolio of nutritious products across

Our focus on Human Sustainability is reflected in our diverse portfolio of delicious foods and beverages,  from treats to healthy eats.  
At PepsiCo,  we have always recognized the diversity of taste and consumer needs around the globe,  whether it is foods and beverages with local flavors,  'grab and go" convenience offerings,  or the growing desire for great-tasting and nutritious products.  In 2009,  we established ambitious targets for the reduction of sodium,  saturated fats and added sugars in our key global brands.  We remain steadfastly committed to these goals and believe we will ultimately achieve them despite some challenges affecting our rates of progress.  In snacks,  we remain focused on improving the nutritional profile of key brands while increasing the baked and whole grain products that we offer.  In beverages,  we added new low- and zero-calorie choices and continue to work to reduce added sugars in key brands.  We 
continue to expand our portfolio of nutritious products across multiple markets to unlock growth opportunities in new product categoriessuch as dairy,  fruits and vegetables,  hummus and other fresh dips,  and baked grain snacks.  We are also accelerating our research and technology investments in the development of low- or no-calorie sweetener alternatives.  PepsiCo believes we have a role to play in helping to address some of the world is most pressing public health challenges,  including nutritional imbalances,  obesity and other lifestyle-related diseases,  especially among children.  We remain actively engaged in the global dialogue on health and wellness and are working in close partnership with governmentsnutrition and health experts,  NGOs,  academics and our peers to address the changing needs and desires of our consumers.

HUMAN Sustainability 
12 PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF) is a powerful example of our commitment to making a difference.  The organization brings together a network of more than 255 retailers,  food and beverage manufacturersrestaurants,  sporting goods and insurance companies,  and trade associations to help reduce obesity,  especially childhood obesity.  For example,  the Together Counts™ program is an HWCF public education campaign that has raised awareness about the importance of achieving an active,  healthy lifestyle with nearly 15 million U.S.  students.  PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation contributed a total of $4 million to support HWCF programs through 2013 and will continue 
to support this exceptional organization.  In 2014,  the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released an independent evaluation finding that the 16 food and beverage companies that are members of HWCF had reduced 64 trillion calories from the marketplace in 2012 compared to 2007 in the U.S.  This achievement well exceeded their commitment to collectively reduce 15 trillion calories from the food supply by 2015.  This reduction equates to 78 calories per person per day in the U.S.  
Product Choice 
The HWCF calorie-reduction achievement is proof that business,  government and NGOs working in partnership can make a significant difference in tackling obesity.  
Trends such as a desire for convenientfunctional nutrition,  local and natural ingredients,  and better-for-you snack and beverage options have firmly taken hold and will continue to accelerate around the world.  We anticipated these trends early on with the acquisitions of Tropicana,  Quaker and Gatorade,  and have taken significant actions to balance our portfolio of offerings.  
Goal: Continue to refine our food and beverage choices to meet changing consumer needs by reducing sodiumadded sugars and saturated fats,  and developing a broader portfolio of product choices.  
For the past five years,  we have been working to deliver great-tasting snacks with lower levels of sodium and saturated fats and delicious beverages with fewer or no added sugars.  
Physical activity event sponsored by the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation 
We are continuing to work toward our ambitious reduction goals in sodium,  saturated fats and added sugars,  even though progress,  in some areas,  is slower than we would like.  
Human Sustainability Goals 
Our Human Sustainability goals are as follows:  Reduce the average amount of saturated fats per serving in key global food brands,  in key countries,  by 15 percent by 2020,  against a 2006 baseline.   Reduce the average amount of added sugars per serving in key global beverage brands,  in key countries,  by 25 percent by 2020,  against a 2006 baseline.   Reduce the average amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands,  in key countries,  by 25 percent by 2020⁶,  against a 2006 baseline.  6 
This goal was reset to 2020 after strategic review of sodium-reduction progress.  See page 17 for a full discussion.  
In our last report,  we added a calculation of tonnage removed,  using the standard methodology employed by HWCF.  While a global average per-serving reduction metric provides a macro view of our progress,  we believe that 
sharing market-level data gives stakeholders a better understanding of where our efforts are taking hold,  and so both are used in this report.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
Like many other companies,  we used our first round of goal-setting to set stretch commitments,  in order to inspire activity and assure that we took action to identify challenges we face on our journey.  We remain steadfastly committed to these reductions in added sugars,  saturated fats and sodium,  and believe we will ultimately be successful despite challenges affecting our rates of progress.  
14 PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
PepsiCo offers three distinct product portfolios Good-for-You Our growing Good-for-You portfolio comprises nutritious food and beverages that include fruits,  vegetables,  whole grains,  low-fat dairynuts,  seeds and nutrients,  with levels of sodiumadded sugars and saturated fats that are in line with global dietary recommendations.  Also included are offerings that provide a functional benefit,  such as addressing the performance needs of athletes.  
Better-for-You We have improved the nutritional profile of many of our snacks and beverages.  In snacks,  we have reduced saturated fats and sodium levelsand we are increasing baked and whole grain offerings.  In beverages,  we are increasing the number of low- and zero-calorie choices and reducing added sugars.  
Fun-for-You Our Fun-for-You portfolio includes treats that are enjoyed all over the world,  as well as regionalculturally relevant favorites.  
The U.S.,  U.K. China and Turkey have already met our 2020 goal of a 
reduction in saturated fats in key global brands in key marketsas compared to the 2006 baseline.  
Saturated Fat On a global average per-serving basis,  we have reduced saturated fats by approximately 3 percent compared to the 2006 baseline.  In 2013,  we removed more than 2100 metric tons of saturated fats from key global brands in key markets as compared to 2006.  One challenge to meeting our saturated fats reduction goal is higher volume growth in developing and emerging markets where healthier oils are less accessible and more costly,  which has slowed progress against our reduction goal.  We continue to monitor our progress closely and are aggressively exploring healthier oil options in our developing and emerging markets.  We are seeing tremendous potential to expedite our progress with changes in how we produce our products and the oil we use.  For examplein the U.S.,  we have reduced the saturated fats content of Lay is and Ruffles by 45 percent and 34 percent,  respectively,  since 2006,  by switching from cottonseed oil to a blend of sunflower and other oils.  
In 2013,  we launched three air-popped potato chip products with Walkers Pops in the U.K.,  Smith is Popped in Australia and Lay is Air Pops in the U.S.  
In addition,  we are exploring new technologiessuch as air popping,  to provide lower-fat options.  In 2013 and early 2014,  we successfully created three air-popped potato chip products with the launch of Walkers Pops in the U.K.,  Smith is Popped in Australia and Lay is Air Pops in the U.S.  Air-popped chips have a crispy and crunchy texture with half the fat of regular potato chips.  These innovations in production,  recipes and technology are a testament to our commitment to transformative research and development,  as we look to reduce saturated fats in consumers' diets without compromising the great taste they associate with our products.  We believe additional breakthrough innovations are well within our reach in the coming years as we continue to make progress toward our reduction goal for saturated fats.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
We have made progress in the past five years since declaring our ambitious goal of reducing saturated fats in our products.  PepsiCo teams in the U.S.,  the U.K.,  China and Turkey have met our goal of a 15 percent reduction in saturated fats in key global brands in key markets,  as compared to the 2006 baseline.  We have also been an industry leader in eliminating nearly all trans fats from our U.S.  product portfolio and many of our global products.  
Added Sugars 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
PepsiCo remains committed to bringing balance to our beverage portfolio by increasing the options for low- or zero-calorie beverages in key global markets.  Offering our products in small portion sizes and providing clear calorie labeling also helps our consumers manage their calories and make informed choices.  In 2013,  through the introduction of new products,  as well as volume shifts for key brands in our portfolio,  we removed approximately 402000 metric tons of added sugars from our total beverage portfolio in North America (U.S.  and Canada) as compared to 2006.  Reducing added sugars in key global brands has continued to be challenging,  but we are making progress in places such as Russia,  BrazilSaudi Arabia,  the U.K.  and Canada.  In 2013the U.K.  launched Trop50,  with 50 percent less sugar than regular Tropicana,  and Russia launched Lipton Ice Tea with 30 percent less sugar than regular Lipton Ice Tea.  PepsiCo Mexico reduced sugar in both Mirinda and Manzanita Sol by 25 percent per serving.  Our commitment to reduce added sugars continues to be challenging because of consumer preference and a global trend away from existing diet sodas.  Consumers in many major markets are demanding natural alternatives to low-calorie sweeteners andas a result,  we have accelerated our research and technology investments to address this 
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines associate at a bottling plant in San  Fernando,  the Philippines 
demand.  Sweeteners naturally low in caloriessuch as stevia,  are becoming increasingly available.  For example,  Pepsi Next in AustraliaFrance,  Canada and the Netherlands is made with stevia,  and is a step toward achieving a meaningful reduction in added sugars.  We continue to explore ways to reduce added sugars through flavor modifiers and sweetener alternatives.  We believe this research will yield new innovations in the coming years that hold tremendous promise toward meeting consumer desire for tasty beverages and foods that are better for you.  
In 2013,  PepsiCo Mexico reduced sugar in Mirinda by 
25% per serving 
Sodium 
We have made progress on all of our goals.  However,  we have more work to do to meet our sodium-reduction goal.  We believe that we will be successful,  but that it will take more time than originally anticipated.  As a result,  we have extended the deadline to 2020,  which is in line with target dates for reductions in saturated fats and added sugars.  We are also committed to supporting the World Health Organization is (WHO) sodiumreduction strategies called for in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013–2020,  and we continue to work toward further sodium reduction in our products.  
To that end,  we have achieved noteworthy success in sodium reductions in individual markets.  For example,  in China and the U.K, we already met the 25 percent sodiumreduction target compared to our 2006 baseline.  PepsiCo Brazil,  Canada,  Mexico and Russia have each achieved more than 10 percent sodium reduction in key brands compared to their respective 2006 baselines.  These countries have taken the lead globally in our sodium-reduction efforts and set the example for what is possible as we look to leverage our global scale and integrate their best practices.  We continue to prioritize the reduction of sodium in our flavored products and,  in 2013Mexico reduced sodium in six different products across our Cheetos,  Doritos,  Tostitos and Fritos brands.  Sodium reductions in these six products range from 5 to 38 percent.  Since 2011,  Saudi Arabia has reduced sodium in 12 products across Lay is,  Cheetos and Tasali potato chips.  In Russia,  we achieved a 34 percent reduction in the sodium content of Cheetos since 2006.  The sodium in Doritos Nacho Cheese was reduced by 31 percent per 40-gram serving as a result of a two-year European R&D project involving two preferred PepsiCo suppliers challenged with developing a new seasoning.  
These accomplishments were made possiblein part,  through advances in manufacturing technology and innovative recipes that have allowed us to maintain the great flavors our consumers expect while reducing sodium levels in our products.  We continue to explore sodium-reduction opportunities with additional investments in R&D to uncover tools and processes that will aid in our efforts.  
reduction in the sodium content of Cheetos in Russia since 2006 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
In 2013,  we reduced sodium per serving by approximately 9 percent and removed more than 1700 metric tons of sodium from key brands in key global markets as compared to 2006.  In 2013,  we removed nearly 3900 metric tons of sodium from our total foods portfolio in key global markets compared to our 2006 baseline.

Broadening Our Portfolio through R&D Innovation We know consumers want great-tasting products,  in convenient forms,  at prices they can afford.  Our innovation aims to address taste,  price and convenience.  Every product we create is the result of extensive work in the test kitchen by our chefs,  product developers and nutritionists on texture,  aroma,  taste,  form,  value and nutrition.  For example,  to increase whole grains in the Malaysian diet,  Quaker Malaysia introduced Quaker Oats for Rice,  which contains seven times more fiber than white rice and three times more than brown rice.  Quaker Oats for Rice is specially made to be cooked with rice,  a staple of the Malaysian diet,  and is easy to prepare.  It is also high in protein,  iron,  magnesium and vitamin B12.  We are positioning our business to take advantage of the growing health and wellness trend,  especially the consumer desire for more protein-enhanced or fortified products.  As we continue to develop more offerings that include protein,  we are building on our existing expertise and knowledge in yogurthummus,  oats and nuts.  In other areas,  such as sports nutrition,  Gatorade and the Gatorade Sports Science Institute continue to study new and innovative ways to help athletes improve 
performance through proper hydration and nutrition.  In 2013,  Gatorade Recover Whey Protein Bars were introduced in the U.S.  to aid muscle recovery after exercise.  In the past year,  Quaker has launched a major protein platform across breakfast and snacksincluding Instant Quaker Oatmeal,  Soft Baked Bars and Breakfast Shakes.  These products offer tasty,  wholesome and convenient breakfast and snack options.  In addition,  Quaker continues to build on its whole grain platform with new products that satisfy the growing consumer demand for convenient and nutritious grains.  In 2012PepsiCo introduced Quaker Real Medleys Oatmeal in the U.S.,  pairing Quaker Oats with 
chunks of real fruit and nuts in a portable and portion-controlled cup.  Inspired by the success of Real Medleys Oatmeal,  we introduced Quaker Real Medleys Bars and Quaker Real Medleys Cereal in the U.S.  in 2013.  Another example of how we are expanding our portfolio to meet consumers' desire for nutrition and protein is our 2012 joint venture with Theo Müller Group.  In 2013,  Muller Quaker Dairy introduced 16 new protein-rich yogurts to the U.S.  Muller Quaker Dairy is now the fifth-largest yogurt manufacturer in the U.S.  and was named as one of the most successful consumer packaged goods brands in 2013.  
Naked Juice is 'Drink Good.  Do Good" campaign donated more than 
150000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to local U.S.  communities in 2013.  
In the U.S.,  Tropicana launched three new flavors of Farmstand 100 percent juice that include one serving of fruit and one serving of vegetables per 8 ounces.  Similarly,  Naked Juice introduced the Chia Sweet Peach and Chia Cherry Lime flavors,  which include chia seeds,  often described as a  isuperfood" rich in omega-3 oils,  antioxidants,  protein and fiber,  as well as the Kale Blazer with green vegetables.

Environmental Sustainability is our goal to find innovative ways to minimize our impact on the environment and lower our costs through energy and water conservation as well as reduced use of packaging materials.  
We believe that multinational corporationsespecially food and beverage companieswill continue to be challenged by increasing water scarcity,  uncertainty in global resourcesand impacts on the agricultural system due to climate change,  such as extreme weather.  These,  along with input cost increases,  price volatility in energy and key food commoditiessaturation of landfills,  and cost increases in packaging materials,  will intensify the need for environmental sustainability to be incorporated into business and functional plans.  This has long been a priority at PepsiCo,  and in 2013 we strengthened our performance with continued reductions in energy use,  water usewaste,  and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  We also advanced innovations in packaging 
and sustainable agriculture,  and improved performance in overall productivity and plant efficiency.  One of the keys to our success remains our numerous partnerships with business,  academia and NGOs,  which allow us to address global and local challenges around the world.  We are actively involved in the United Nations Global Compact,  the World Business Council for Sustainable Development,  the 2030 Water Resources Group,  The Sustainability Consortium,  the World Resources Institute,  the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable and many other multi-stakeholder groups on these issues.

PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
Goal: Help protect and conserve global water supplies,  especially in water-stressed areas,  and partner to provide access to safe water.  For the last three years,  the World Economic Forum is Global Risk Report has identified water supply crises as among the world is top five risks.  With agriculture accounting for approximately 70 percent of global water use,  water is one of the most important resources for the food and beverage industry.  It is often the industry is most-used resource,  with significant up-front costs to buy and downstream costs to treat after use.  Our food business relies heavily on water to help grow and process the agricultural goods that are the basis for the majority of our products.  At an operational level,  we rely on water for energy transfer and sanitation,  as do our suppliers.  
In 2013,  PepsiCo renewed our commitment to water stewardship with the public commitment to 'help protect and conserve global water supplies,  especially in water-stressed areasand provide access to safe water. " This is operationalized through five water stewardship imperatives,  underpinned by our public recognition of water as a fundamental human right,  and includes: (1) water efficiency improvement in our direct operations; (2) extending conservation to our supply chain,  particularly agriculture; (3) pursuing integrated watershed management; 
(4) partnering to provide community access to safe water; and (5) public water advocacy and engagement.  PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation are proud of having helped,  through its partnerships3 million people gain access to safe water,  and having since doubled the goal to 6 million by the end of 2015.  Advocating for sustainable solutions to water insecurity is critical,  and PepsiCo works with many stakeholders toward common objectives.  
Our progress in this area continues to be recognized.  For example,  in 2012 we were honored to receive the Stockholm Industry Water Award and the U.S.  Water Prize.  In 2013,  we were awarded the Corporate Climate Adaptation Award from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) for our water-reduction approaches with precision agriculture (like i-crop and the application of drip irrigation).

Wastewater Treatment 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
Reducing our water use upstream of and within our operations is only one part of our approach to water stewardship.  An equally important aspect is how we treat water once we have finished using it in our operations.  Our aim is to reuse as much of our treated process water as possible through recovery and reuse systems that enable the return of safe and clean water to the communities where we operate.  Our ReCon platform and our Treated Water Efficiency Tool enable beverage plants to optimize their water treatment systems,  and together have saved an estimated $640000 and reduced water consumption by more than 200000 cubic meters per year in our U.S.  beverage operations.  Wastewater treatment at our snack plants in Colombia,  Chile,  Mexico,  Australia and the U.S.  all employ a 'total systems" approach to treating and conserving water.  These systems apply a combination of technologies including membrane bioreactors,  reverse osmosissystems to reduce water hardness and chlorine levels,  UV disinfection,  and sand and carbon to purify the water and remove residual color.  These technologies enable us to produce potable water for reuse in the snacks production lines,  and serve as an example for the entire industrial sector.

PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
PepsiCo was among the first companies of its size to recognize water as a basic human right.  The United Nations defines the human right to water as all people is right to safe,  sufficientacceptable,  physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use.  As part of our holistic approach to water stewardshipwe support access to safe and clean water programs across the globe.  In 2007,  we set a goal to form partnerships to provide 3 million people around the world with access to safe water by 2015.  Through careful research and consultation with stakeholdersPepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation established six partnerships that cover a diverse spectrum of complementary solutions to the global water crisis.  These partners are the Columbia Water Center at the Earth Institute of Columbia University; the Safe Water Network,  for which the PepsiCo Foundation was an inaugural partner; the Inter-American Development Bank; the China Women is Development Foundation; Water, org; and the 2030 Water Resources Group.  
PepsiCo and the PepsiCo Foundation have been partners with Columbia Water Center (CWC) at the Earth Institute of Columbia University since 2008.  During this time,  CWC has developed,  tested and delivered solutions to water scarcity around the world.  
These projects have included development of low-cost tensiometers that help smallholder farmers in India apply the correct amount of water to their crops and innovative water allocation plans that helped provide access to safe water to more than

In 2010,  PepsiCo began to study and develop a detailed Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of PepsiCo is U.S.  beverage packaging.  Our analysis resulted in a ground breaking level of detail for how we source,  process and manage packaging material.  Our ongoing LCA efforts have found that lightweighting and using food grade recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in packaging,  sustained by increased recycling of PET containers,  are effective techniques for reducing environmental impacts.  We also have pinpointed areas,  such as material components or processes,  where changes would be most beneficial for reducing our energy use,  water consumption or emissions.  In the coming yearswe believe these efforts will lead to identifying more and more pathways for PepsiCo to minimize our environmental impact.  As we work toward incorporating LCA into more of our products and packaging,  we are seeking a technological breakthrough to reduce the amount of our packaging that is sent to landfills at the end of its life cycle.  For example,  we have ongoing work streams examining how to make our pressure-sensitive labels and shrinkwrap labels more recycle-friendly and,  ultimatelyfully recyclable.

One key element of our packaging strategy involves ongoing research to develop packaging that is lighter in weight without compromising quality and safety.  Initiatives to reduce packaging include lightweighting,  film downgauging,  bag optimization,  reducing carton size and much more.  For example,  around the world,  we are working to adjust the equipment used to seal our food bags so that we can reduce the size of the seal flap.  By reducing seal size and right-sizing a number of primary packaging items,  Frito-Lay North America was able to eliminate more than 11 million pounds of flexible film packaging,  equivalent to 65 billion 1-ounce single-serve bags in 2013.  
PepsiCo has enjoyed a competitive advantage globally in the area of packaging,  and particularly in plastics.  
In 2013,  we completed a system conversion to transition some of our Gatorade multi-packs to lighter-weight secondary packaging.  This change resulted in a reduction of nearly 39 million packaging pounds on an annualized basis.

Our snacks plant in Kolkata,  India has dramatically increased the percentage of renewable energy it uses from 10 to 70 percent.  This increase was achieved by using rice hulls (from a supplier) as a renewable energy source to cook potato chips and utilizing the snack plant is waste heat as the energy source for on-site chillersmaking it the first time these specific innovative solutions have been used within PepsiCo.  
In early 2014,  PepsiCo is Tolleson facility in Arizona launched a new solar photovoltaic system that converts the sun is rays into as much as 17 megawatts of clean electricity capacity.  The electricity is channeled into the facility is substation to help power the manufacture and distribution of PepsiCo products such as Gatorade,  SoBe,  Propel and Lipton Iced Tea.  At the 900000-square-foot distribution center (a separate facility),  more than 5600 flat solar photovoltaic panels adorn the roofwhich can generate more than 3 million kilowatt hours annually — enough electricity to power 
approximately 200 average Arizona homes for an entire year — or 10 percent of the electricity used by the entire Tolleson facility each year.  The photovoltaic project has produced approximately 900000 kilowatt hours per year since its installation in 2008.  Our commitment to solar projects extends to other large installations in ModestoCalifornia; Casa Grande,  Arizona and elsewhere.  We are proud of these achievements and hope to replicate these innovative best practices across the globe in the coming years.  
Since 2011,  PepsiCo Brazil has been using oat hulls produced in the manufacturing process as a fuel source for the boilers at its Quaker plant in Porto Alegre.  This program has resulted in a 41 percent reduction in total energy use at the plant since 2010.  It also has redirected 1440 tons per year of oat hull waste that otherwise would have been disposed of and reduced fossil fuel and natural gas usage by 456000 cubic meters at the Porto Alegre facility.

Sustainable Agriculture 
Sustainable Farming Initiative 
The PepsiCo Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI) is designed to encourage both PepsiCo and our growers to operate in ways that reduce environmental and social impacts while maintaining economic viability at the farm level.  
GOAL: Continue to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers.  Whether oats for Quaker,  potatoes or corn for Frito-Lay,  or oranges for Tropicana,  we are a company that depends on agriculture across our food and beverage businesses.  The majority of our raw materials,  in terms of dollar spend,  come directly from agriculture.  Agriculture represents more than 70 percent of the world is water use,  20 to 30 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,  and 40 percent of global employment.  Implementing sustainable farming practices thus represents a huge opportunity.  These statistics are an important reminder of the critical need to advance sustainable farming practices throughout the world.  Sustainable agriculture is a major focus for PepsiCo to help secure our supply chain,  reap productivity advantages and enable future growth.  
The SFI was developed as a standard to guide our suppliers in sustainable practices and provide them with resources,  training and support to meet our standard across the three pillars of sustainability: social,  economic and environmental.  The SFI is unique in covering all three pillars,  as many standards focus solely on environmental issues.  We have worked with industry partners Validus,  LLC and Business for Social Responsibility to collaborate on a standard that works for any farm,  any cropanywhere.  We also have made the guidelines easy to use,  and importantly,  are working with other companies to cross-honor each other is standards,  recognizing that time needed to fill out paperwork is time away from farming.  
EN V IRON MENTA L SUSTA INA BILIT Y 
The SFI has currently been deployed across 300000 acres in North America,  encompassing our potato and corn suppliers,  and our pledge with Walmart,  our largest customer,  is to extend this to reach 500000 acres by the end of 2016.  The SFI will continue to expand into PepsiCo is ever-growing agricultural-based supply chain.  For example,  a Dairy Sustainable Farming Initiative is under development for use on farms within our dairy supply chain.  We intend to launch this program in 2015.

PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2013 
The SFI was piloted in 2011 and 2012 across 14 countries and officially rolled out in 2013 across the U.S.,  the U.K.,  Brazil,  Chile,  Argentina and Mexico.  The SFI has been successfully implemented on a wide variety of farms — from smallholder to large agribusinesses,  which reflects the diversity of our supply chain.  
This Land Policy complements the PepsiCo Supplier Code of Conduct,  which is part of the contracting process with suppliers and addresses the areas of labor practicesassociate health and safety,  environmental management and business integrity.  
Sustainable certification for ingredients PepsiCo continues to leverage third-party expertise to help meet our environmental sustainability goals.  For instance,  PepsiCo is a member of Bonsucroa global nonprofit dedicated to reducing the environmental and social impacts of sugar cane production while recognizing the need for economic viability.  PepsiCo is working with Bonsucro and other relevant stakeholders to evaluate certification standards that can help the company meet a goal of 100 percent sustainable cane sugar by 2020.  
In early 2014,  PepsiCo rolled out a new Land Policy with zero tolerance for illegal activities in our supply chain and zero tolerance for land displacements of any legitimate land tenure holders.  This policy built on the previously established policies and programs that existed in the areas of supplier conduct,  sustainable agriculture and environmental health and safety.

In São Mateus,  Brazil,  we have entered into a partnership with one of our coconut suppliers,  Regon Group,  to send processed effluent from the wastewater treatment plant at our facility to a neighboring farm to be used for irrigation and as fertilizer.  The treated wastewater contains large amounts of nutrients,  especially potassium,  beneficial in coconut farming.  To ensure the quality of the treated effluent,  PepsiCo and our supplier monitor both the effluent as well as the soil of the farm,  through a specialized laboratory.  The farm also uses crushed coconut,  a waste by-product of the extraction of coconut water,  as ground cover on the farms.  In addition to providing nutrients,  this cover protects soil against weeds and prevents excessive water evaporation.
