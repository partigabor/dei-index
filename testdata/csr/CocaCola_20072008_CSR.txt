 Letter from Our President and CEO 
Muhtar KentPresident and Chief Executive Officer 
Dear Fellow Stakeholder: 
 am writing this letter at an important time for our Companyour bottling partners,  our industry and the world.  Over the past four years,  The Coca‑Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system have made significant progress in developing and executing a clear strategy,  energizing our people,  transforming our businessand bringing refreshment and moments of happiness to consumers 15 billion times each day.  Looking ahead,  we see a bright future with millions of potential new consumers entering the middle class,  thirsty for the world is favorite beverages.  We see the possibility for a variety of innovative new beverages that cater to our consumers' evolving lifestyles and life-stage needs.  At the same time,  we are keenly aware that serious challenges—from climate change and water scarcity to poverty and infectious disease—threaten the strength of our business and the communities we serve.  The Expanding Role Business Must Play 
We have seen through our own experiences—time and again— that our business in any market is only as strong and sustainable as the communities in which we operate.  Borrowing from my days of studying statistics in university,  there is a clear 'one-to-one regression" in terms of strong,  sustainable businesses and strong,  sustainable communities.  For our Company and our bottling partners,  sustainability reflects an understanding of the role our business must play in society if we are to be successful in the 21st century.  The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review 
PRESIDENT AND CEO LETTER 
This understanding is expressed in our renewed focus on productivity and efficiency,  the goals we have set as a systemand the ways in which we are engaging with stakeholders and communities on issues such as water stewardship; energy and climate protection; sustainable packaging; active,  healthy living; workplace rights; and community development.  We continue to take actions across our Company and the Coca-Cola system to minimize waste,  maximize profit,  and advance our operationswhile working to be better global citizens.  Stronger Partnerships 
The partnerships we have established with organizations such as the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID)World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) enable us to support sustainable communities while sharing best practices that allow us to improve the way we run our business.  By working together with USAID on community water initiativesfor example,  we are now helping more than 250000 people in more than 20 countries gain access to safe drinking water.  Under our partnership with WWF,  we are working to measurably conserve seven of the most critical freshwater river basinsspanning some 20 countries.  And in 2006,  we joined the United Nations Global Compact and became a signatory of the United Nations CEO Water Mandate in 2007.  
CONTENTS 
Our View: 
Our business is only as strong and sustainable as the communities in which we operate.  
In today is complex world,  the roles and responsibilities of our Company are expanding.  
We are further developing stakeholder and community relationships to address issues and opportunities.  
Our sustainability efforts are an important component in helping us attract and retain talented associates.  
Local Business 
We believe that our Company and our system are local businesses on a global scale.  Everywhere we operate in more than 200 countries,  we rely on local associates,  bottling partners and business partners to provide our consumers with the highest-quality beverages and our communities with an active,  caring and engaged corporate neighbor.  We all have a responsibility to take care of the communities in which we live and work.  In cooperation with our bottling partnerswe share a commitment to continually build our business in a way that is economically,  environmentally and socially sustainable for both the Coca-Cola system and for the communities in which we operate.  That means supporting economic development,  being a responsible employer and having a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities.  An example of our work to support economic development is our new Manual Distribution Centers pilot project in Africa,  which hires and trains local entrepreneurs who are engaged in distributing our products.  To date,  this program has generated more than 7500 jobs and created an even stronger positive economic impact on communities across East Africa.  
our associates as we meet with them around the world.  They tell us they are proud to be part of a company that engages in issues at work in the same way they engage with societal issues in their own lives.  This holds true for the associates of our bottling partners,  too.  There is no question that our efforts across the sustainability spectrum are helping us attract and retain the best and brightest people throughout the Coca-Cola system.  The better our peoplethe stronger our Company and our bottling partners can become today and tomorrow.  In Conclusion 
While we note many accomplishments in this report,  we do not claim perfection,  and we do not intend this report to be the final word.  Instead,  we hope it sparks dialogue and encourages action from our associates,  bottling partners,  customers,  consumers and community members,  so that together we can act,  inspire and make a difference as a Company and as a system.  We know our journey is just beginning; we are committed to our efforts,  and we welcome your feedback.  Sincerely Inspired Associates 
Along our journey,  we have received many positive reactions and many new challenges from stakeholders,  which we welcome.  Perhaps one of the most visible changes has been in the attitudes of The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review

Sustainability: Essential to Our Business 
In 2002,  The Coca-Cola Company and six of our largest bottling partners developed a strategy for sustainability.  That plan focuses on the role and impact of the Coca-Cola system in four key areas: workplace,  marketplaceenvironment and community.  We use this strategy to guide our approach to sustainability issues and to report our progress.  To see how this strategy is adopted throughout the Coca-Cola system,  visit the websites of some of our largest bottling partners (see page 65).  
To achieve this,  we are realigning our business model to match the interests of our business,  society and environment,  both in the short and long term.  We are providing tools,  training and planning for our associates and our business to make us more productive,  efficient and effective.  We are assessing everything—from our operations and our processes to how we work with partners and market our products—to see where we can build better,  more effective systems and improve our overall productivity,  so our business can continue to grow.  
Sustainability at Coca-Cola 
Our Company has always endeavored to conduct business responsibly and ethically.  To us,  sustainability means evolving our business for continued success,  recognizing that the health of our business is directly linked to the health of the communities we serve.  Sustainability is a significant driver of value that offers meaningful long-term benefits for our business and society.  In 2008,  we elevated sustainability into our business growth agenda and we are now defining our objective as 'accelerating sustainable growth to operate in tomorrow is world. " As a result,  we now include sustainability among the key criteria by which we evaluate our business plans and performance.  We assess how we are improving our earnings and our competitive position,  as well as how we are strengthening the sustainability of our business practices.  
Roadmap to Success 
We understand that integrating sustainability takes more than business processes alone.  For sustainability to take root and thrive,  we must develop the necessary capabilities and culture.  We are building sustainability into the personal accountability and objectives of our associates and are committed to communicating about our sustainability progress to our external audiences and partners.  Our next step is to embed sustainability into our strategic planning process.  As we evaluate business performance in our 2009–2011 planning cyclewe will assess our progress,  determining whether we are meeting existing commitments,  creating new shared value for our customers and partnersand engaging others through our leadership team.

Introduction 
Scope of Report 
This 2007/2008 Sustainability Review covers performance of The Coca‑Cola Company ('Company") and the Coca-Cola system (our Company and bottling partners) from August 2007 through July 2008.  In cases where information is tracked by calendar year,  the data reflects 2007 performance.  Environmental data refers to the Coca‑Cola systemunless otherwise indicated.  In this report,  we have taken an issues-based approach to discussing our performance.  The report is organized into four sections: WorkplaceMarketplace,  Environment and Community.  Each section includes topics critical to the sustainability of our business and evaluates where we stand on those topics.  We report on many sustainability factors that are not covered in this 2007/2008 Sustainabililty Review.  On page 65,  we provide links to these topics and a new question and answer section on our Company website.  We have included an extensive discussion of potential risks and challenges to our business in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K,  pages 12–19.  We discuss some of these issues and include others of interest to our stakeholders in this report,  such as water scarcity and quality,  energy use and climate change,  sustainable packaging,  obesity and other health concerns,  workplace and human rights,  associate health and safetyanti‑corruption and product quality.  Metrics 
Our sustainability reporting is still evolving,  and we are working to employ improved metrics.  While we discuss initiatives and programs,  as well as progress from year to year,  we recognize the need to report additional quantifiable metrics and targets,  especially as they relate to our social performance and economic impact.  Pages 10–12 provide a summary of our performance against our current metrics.  We map sustainability issues,  prioritizing them and determining what will be discussed in our next Sustainability Review as well as the Company is Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are also continuing to develop the necessary systems and targets to gauge our performance and to consistently gather global data as a Company and system.  Other Reports 
 description of our business operations and financial performance is provided in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  More information on our sustainability performance can be found in our 2007 Annual Review.  The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review

In April 2007,  associates from The Coca‑Cola Company and several of our largest bottling partners met for the first time to discuss the development of a core set of sustainability performance indicators for the Coca‑Cola system.  We continue to develop these metrics and analyze new data and collection methods to add rigor to our process.  We have formed working groups of Company associates and representatives from our bottling partners to determine the feasibility—due to the legal and management complexity of the Coca‑Cola system (see page 8)—of collecting and consolidating economic and social data in addition to the environmental data already collected.  Many of our bottling partners produce their own corporate responsibility and sustainability reports,  and we provide links to their websites in the 'About Bottling" section of our website.  Engaging Our Partners & SUPPLIERS 
Our contribution to sustainable development and the benefits to our business can be greatly magnified when we work together with our bottling partners,  customers and other stakeholders.  Since publishing our Corporate Responsibility Review in August 2007,  we have conducted several feedback sessions with internal and external stakeholders.  They include shareownersassociates,  bottling partners,  suppliers,  government partners,  studentsNGOs,  customers and consumers.  We have used their feedback to help shape this report,  including our level of transparency,  and the variety of topics and issues we address.  We also receive feedback from stakeholders by email.  This is a valuable tool for us to understand your thoughts and concerns.  We invite you to send your comments,  suggestions or critiques on our sustainability practices or the content of this report to crreview[at]na, ko, com.  CONTENTS

By the end of 2008,  we expect all our workplaces to have completed Workplace Rights Policy assessments.  Corrective actions will then be taken where necessary to ensure full compliance.  In 2006,  2007 and 2008we received a top rating of 100% from the Human Rights Campaign for our performance regarding workplace policies for gay,  lesbian,  bisexual and transgender associates.  
To ensure the Policy is implemented and abided by globally,  we conduct assessments and education sessions in Company-owned facilities worldwide.  In 2007,  we conducted 106 assessments and 74 training sessions.  We also engage with external stakeholders to assess our operations and seek advice on areas of improvement.  In 2008,  we co-hosted a conference focused on forced labor to examine actions companies can collectively take to address the problem of forced labor around the world.  The conference,  which included representatives of the International Labour Organizationfocused on experiences of companies that are actively engaged in eliminating forced labor within their spheres of business.  The conference was sponsored by the United States Council for International Business,  the United States Chamber of Commerce and the International Organisation of Employers.  In 2007,  we joined the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR),  a group of 13 leading multinational companies focused on identifying practical ways of applying human rights principles within the business context.  As members,  we explore ways to work within our Company and with associations,  governments,  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)trade unions and local communities on human rights issues.  Membership also helps us maintain dialogue with key stakeholders in the human rights community,  which helps build our understanding of human rights issues and concerns in communities where we operate.  We are committed to working with and encouraging independent bottling partners to uphold the principles in our Policy and our Statement and to adopt similar policies within their respective businesses.

We believe in a healthy work-life balance,  and our Company works diligently to help ensure this is a reality for our associates.  We offer associates training and workshops on time management; provide flexible work arrangements in some areas of our business; and provide tools and resources to allow work to be done efficiently and effectively in a normal workday.  One success story is our office in Argentina.  Coca-Cola Argentina was the first company in Latin America to reach the 'Work and Life Balance" certification based on the German Hertie Foundation is 'Work and Family Audit. " The program recognized companies that demonstrate a commitment to their employees' potential and life balance through internal human resources programs and policies that aim to improve the quality of life of their employeeswhile upgrading and optimizing job performance.

Managing individual safety and health in the workplace is every associate is responsibility.  That responsibility is backed by our Company policy to provide a safe working environment in all of our operations—this includes our offices,  laboratories,  and bottling and manufacturing plants,  as well as our warehouses and vehicles.  We face challenges driving performance in an industry that is traditionally perceived as low risk and therefore lacks the safety culture of other higher-risk industries.  We recognize the need to bring about a cultural change in our management concerning workplace safety and health,  and incorporate it as a core element of our sustainability progress.  
We provide substantial health and safety training for our associatesincluding new-hire introductions and periodic refresher training for associates and others working on our behalf.  
We have embarked on a performance improvement plan that includes better collection of metrics,  goal setting,  capability building,  and an increased focus on our fleet and distribution operations.  Our Safety Management System is an integral part of The Coca‑Cola Management System (TCCMS).  TCCMS combines our environmental,  quality,  safety and health standards and guidelines,  and establishes a continuous improvement platform for our Company and bottling partners.  TCCMS has been recognized by both SGS and Lloyd is Register Quality Assurance (LRQA)—leading international certification bodies—as consistent with the international Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series management standard OHSAS 18001:2007.  Many of our sites have pursued additional external accreditations.  In the United States,  four of our 23 plants have achieved Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) Star status—the highest recognition from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Another four applications for the VPP Star Program are pending for this year,  and the remaining sites will apply in the future.  Globally,  we have 37 Company-owned sites that have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification,  including 92 percent of our concentrate plants,  and plans are in place for future certification of the remaining non‑U.S.  sites.  Coca‑Cola system facilities undergo independent third-party audits of the occupational safety and health of their operations.  Audits are performed a minimum of every three yearsand plants with poor scores are audited annually until the issues are corrected.  If any facility fails the audit,  that facility is expected to implement corrective actions and a follow-up audit is scheduled.

Our syrup plant in ColumbusOhio,  was the first sparkling beverage operation in the United States to achieve the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) Star status.  Our concentrate plant in Puerto Rico is one of only 15 VPP sites in that commonwealth.  
 key to ensuring a safe working environment is driving associate engagement through training and involvement.  TCCMS requires that each facility establish processes,  such as safety committees,  to engage associates in the development and implementation of policiesprocedures and risk-reduction activities.  A series of 19 interactive training modules has been issued to our facilities and bottling partners globally to cover training for the full range of Company safety requirements.  In 2007,  we developed a new global metrics system which,  when fully implemented,  will allow monthly results tracking across all of our Company-owned operations.  Collecting dataor metrics,  continues to be a challenge for us,  in part due to technological and calibration issues and the expanse of our field operations throughout our system.  We are concerned about and saddened by any injury or loss of life associated with our operations.  We work hard to ensure that our associates understand and follow good safety practices,  and we continue to improve our efforts.  In 2007,  we reported a Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR*) of 23,  with 29407 lost days.  Regrettably,  we have reports of three associates losing their lives in 2007 as a result of incidents while on our property,  and an additional two associates lost their lives in 2007 as a result of traffic accidents while performing their jobs.  The lessons learned from these incidents will help us take steps to prevent future accidents.  Note that the above data reflects the performance of Company-owned operations only and does not include data from our bottling partners and the Coca‑Cola system as a whole.  We recognize that what we report may increase in the short term as our data collection improves.  We believe that developing a strong and effective safety culture is essential to the sustainability of our business and is a key indicator of a well-managed operation.  We have a vision of zero injuries and fatalities,  but we are not yet there.  We continue to work on the improvements to our culture and operations,  encouraged that we are setting a strong foundation for a safe and healthy future for all our associates and contractors.  *The LTIR is calculated as the number of incidents resulting in lost days per 200000 work hours.  'Lost days" includes all days during which associates or casual contractors are unable to perform their normal work due to time off,  work restriction or job transfer as a result of work‑related injury or illness.

By changing how we select our suppliers,  a process which now includes an SGP audit,  11 cases of child labor were identified and addressed in advance of any Company purchases in 2007.  Specific supplier results include: 	 In El Salvador,  we have supported a multi-stakeholder initiative to eliminate child labor in the country.  Because of this effort,  thousands of children have been removed from sugarcane fields and enrolled in education programs.  	 Applying our learnings from El Salvador,  we are working with 11 mills in Central America to assess and address the issue of child labor and drive the necessary improvements to workplace conditions.  This action impacts more than 2000 workers.

Our Supplier Guiding Principles ('SGP") are a vital pillar of The Coca‑Cola Company is workplace accountability programs.  The SGP emphasizes the importance of responsible environment and workplace policies and practices that comply,  at a minimum,  with applicable laws and regulations.  Our SGP reflects the values we uphold in our own policiesand we expect our direct suppliers to follow the spirit and intent of these principles.  Our SGP is communicated in writing as part of the supplier agreement as well as through training to all new suppliers and to our current suppliers who need extra assistance in enhancing their operations.  In 2007,  we reissued our SGP with broadened criteria,  requirements and standardsincorporating lessons we have learned through supplier assessments and audits.  This revised SGP helped us determine a process for responsible sourcing of promotional merchandise as well as for ensuring an SGP-compliant supply chain.  The new SGP has full endorsement from our leadership in all countries where we operate.  Our business operations are required to implement SGP guidelines and standards,  with additional focus on addressing adequate processes when sourcing promotional merchandise (see page 20 for an example of this process).  We conduct routine assessments of suppliers' compliance with our SGP.  If a supplier fails to uphold any aspect of our SGP requirements,  the supplier is expected to implement corrective actions or risk possible contract termination.  In 2007,  the Company conducted 1313 audits assessing supplier compliance and worked with suppliers to bring them to a higher standardwhere necessary.  In China,  we established a stable base of promotional material suppliers through pre-certification audit results,  decreasing our number of eligible suppliers from 300 to 22.  We then worked with those 22 suppliers to continually improve their working conditions and standards for associates,  resulting in a 75 percent audit performance improvement for 2007,  and creating better workplace conditions for approximately 83000 workers.  In 2007,  we joined the industry association AIM-PROGRESS,  designed to increase collaboration among 20 peer companies in the area of social compliance in supply chains.  The association gives us a forum to share ideas and best practices while also driving efficiency and consistency in compliance auditing.  All of the member companies have committed to supporting the four basic pillars of the association: Labor StandardsHealth and Safety,  Environmental Management and Business Integrity.

Eliminating Child Labor Implementing a Supplier Pre-Certification System 
Each year,  our Company purchases tens of thousands of handstitched promotional soccer balls to support high-profile sponsorships.  The risk of child labor in soccer ball production is high.  Children working at home are often employed to handstitch soccer ball panels together,  creating an invisible workforce that is sometimes missed by formal workplace audits.  To combat this problem,  we created a "Soccer Ball Pre-Certification System, " which includes a comprehensive supplier audit in addition to our standard audit to identify and pre-certify compliant suppliers.  This system directs our procurement teams to only purchase soccer balls from pre-certified suppliers.  In 2007,  we used this protocol to identify a compliant supplier in India,  recognizing the potential risk of child labor in the region. * By applying our Soccer Ball Pre-Certification System,  we were able to identify a supplier who was working to address the issue of child labor.  Through its association with the Sports Goods Foundation of India,  the supplier works with various international labor and children is organizations to ensure compliance through associate monitoring,  conducting community awareness sessions and providing educational opportunities.  These educational opportunities include the operation of 30 tuition-free schools that directly benefit the children of adult home-based stitchers.  After a series of reviews for quality,  business needs and compliance audits,  we began placing orders with this supplier in 2008,  creating approximately 80 jobs and supporting social compliance efforts made in the region.  * The United States Department of Labor estimates that as many as 30000 children work in India is sporting goods industry.

We aspire to help people lead active,  healthy lifestyles through the beverages we produce and how we market them,  the nutritional information we provide and our support of programs that encourage active lifestyles.  There is increasing concern about obesity.  While there are many factors involved in obesity,  the fundamental cause is an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended.  We are playing a leading role together with our partners and other stakeholders in identifying and implementing solutions to address issues of obesity as they affect consumers and our industry.  We promote active,  healthy living through three guiding principles: Nutrition Labeling in Europe 
In Europe,  we are committed to on‑package Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) labeling designed to give consumers meaningful,  consistent and transparent nutritional information.  In addition,  we have committed to putting the number of calories per serving on the front of all packagingalong with the percentage the calories represent of total recommended daily calorie consumption.  On the back of packaging,  we provide nutritional information for calories,  sugars,  total fatsodium and fibre per serving size and per 100 mL.  By the end of 2008,  we plan to include GDA nutrition labeling on all of our packages in Europe.  
	 Think—Education is essential to achieve sustainable,  active,  healthy lifestyles.  	 Drink—Providing product and package variety is our commitment to consumers.  	 Move—Physical activity is vital for health and well-being.  THINK 
Education is the essential link that enables people to select healthful diets and become more physically fit.  We are committed to supporting educational programs designed to expand consumer knowledge and understanding about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  We have made great strides in expanding the level of nutritional information on our packagingoffering consumers factual and meaningful information about our beverage products to assist them in their beverage selections.  Our policy is to place nutritional information on all of our labels,  where feasible.  Where this is not possible,  for example on recyclable glass bottleswe provide nutritional information via other means such as Company websites.  We follow labeling requirements in the countries where our products are sold,  and in many places,  we exceed these requirements.  The type and amount of information is a reflection of local regulations and consumer interest.  At a minimum,  our labels provide the beverage product is amount of calories,  protein,  fat and carbohydrate.  We participate in nationally tailored nutrition labeling programs in many regions and countries,  including Australia,  the European Union,  Latin America and the United States.

In 2007,  the Company launched 450 new beverage products,  including 150 low- and no-calorie options for consumers.  The launch of these low- and no-calorie options expanded our portfolio of that category by approximately 17 percent from 2006 to 2007.  To date,  we have more than 700 low- and no-calorie beverage products,  accounting for approximately 23 percent of our 2007 unit case volume.  Coca‑Cola Zero,  now available in more than 90 countries,  has been an important addition to these no-calorie beverage alternatives.  As an additional way to help consumers manage calories,  we continue to introduce smaller packaging sizes in markets throughout the world.  In the United States,  we introduced the 8-ounce,  100-calorie aluminum cans of Coca‑Cola,  Cherry Coke and Sprite.  Understanding the growing consumer need for products that deliver enhanced beverage benefits,  we offer functional beverages that can help consumers address nutrition gaps and performance needs.  For example,  NutriJuice,  a vitamin- and mineral-fortified orange juice drink specifically developed to help address the problem of iron-deficiency anemia and malnutrition in children,  was launched in the Philippines in 2007.

In 2008,  we expanded our 'Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy" to include all of our beverage products in a broad range of media.  Through this policy,  children under the age of 12 are not to be directly targeted by any of our marketing messages in advertising,  nor will they be shown drinking any of our beverage products outside of the presence of a caregiver.  For more than 50 years,  our policy for responsible marketing to children has been in place for our sparkling,  full-calorie beverages.  We understand and respect that parents are seeking greater control over their children is exposure to marketing messages as they guide their food and beverage choices and have changed our practices accordingly.  Our Company is 'Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy" is applied to all marketing media where targeted demographic tracking is available: television,  radio,  print,  the Internet and mobile phones.  We also avoid directly targeting children in other areas where parents may not be present to supervise,  such as schools and youth clubs.  In the United Kingdom,  we support the government initiative to limit drinks available in secondary schools to bottled water,  skimmed or semi-skimmed milk,  pure fruit juicesyogurt and milk drinks (with less than 5 percent added sugar),  or drinks made from a combination of these.  In the United States and Canadawe adhere to the Model Guidelines for School Beverage Partnerships and the American Beverage Association is policy regarding the sale of beverages in schools.  In cooperation with this policy,  we are providing a range of low- and no-calorie and smallerportion beverage options of milkbottled water,  and pure fruit juice with no added sweeteners,  and removing full-calorie sodas from schools.  
As a global company with strong connections to our communities,  we make every effort to adhere to the local,  cultural,  political and religious requirements in the markets we serve.  We are committed to monitoring our policy to ensure it is responsive to the needs and requests of parents and caregivers and reflects the ever-changing marketplace.  We have advocated for the entire nonalcoholic beverage industry worldwide to follow the same approach.  In 2008,  a set of guidelines consistent with our policy was adopted by the International Council of Beverages Associations,  and we are currently creating an independent monitoring mechanism—together with partners,  peers and competitors—in compliance with these guidelines.  We consider public preference regarding beverages that are available in schools.  Throughout Europe,  we support the Union of European Beverages Associations' commitments regarding marketing to children and the sale of beverages in schools.  This precludes any engagement in direct commercial activity in primary schools,  while offering a full range of beverages provided in appropriate container sizes in secondary schools.

We measure key product and package quality attributes to ensure our beverage products in the marketplace meet Company requirements and consumer expectations.  Consistency and reliability are critical to our product quality and to meeting global regulatory requirements and Company standards.  The global nature of our business requires that the Coca‑Cola  system has the highest standards and processes for ensuring consistent product safety and quality—from our concentrate production to our bottling and product delivery.  To ensure such consistency and reliability,  the Coca-Cola system is governed by The Coca‑Cola Management System (TCCMS).  TCCMS is our integrated quality management program,  which holds all of our operations systemwide to the same standards for production and distribution of our beverages.  It guarantees the highest standards in the management of product quality,  the environment,  and health and safety throughout the Coca-Cola system.  Quality compliance throughout the Coca‑Cola system is verified by periodic on-site audits conducted by our system and third parties.  Through multiple treatment steps including disinfection,  filtration,  purificationand routine monitoring of equipmenttemperatures and water qualitywe ensure our products meet all Company quality standards.  
TCCMS has endorsement from all leadership throughout the Coca-Cola system.  It guides our product safety and quality by integrating and aligning business and quality objectives with consistent metrics to monitor performance; integrating preventive action as a management tool,  including more rigorous demands when planning new product and service introductions; incorporating Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) into our system standards; and defining problem-solving methodologies and tools to drive continuous product safety and quality improvements.  To stay current with new regulations,  industry best practices and marketplace conditionswe consistently reassess the relevance of our product safety and quality guidelines in TCCMS.  Given the increased awareness of the importance of food safety,  not only in manufacturing but also throughout the entire supply chain,  we are refining our requirements to further ensure that TCCMS embodies the most recent and stringent manufacturing processes.  Each business within the Coca-Cola system must establish,  implement,  document and maintain a safety and quality system in accordance with TCCMS requirements.  In 2007,  we increased our Company is Global Product Quality Index rating to 945 from 942 in 2006,  reaching our highest-ever value.

Our system is among the world is top purchasers of sugar,  citrus and coffee.  Because farming is not our primary business,  we do not have direct control over farm practices.  However,  we do have significant opportunities to develop and encourage more sustainable practices to benefit suppliers,  customers and consumers throughout our global supply chain.  Agriculture has a large social and environmental footprint in the world.  As the population increases,  the agricultural sector will need to produce more food,  both stressing supply and potentially increasing this footprint.  
Green and Lean SUPPLY CHAIN 
The Coca-Cola system currently operates a $50 billion supply chain network,  making it one of the largest and most complex supply chains in the world.  'Green and Lean" is an initiative designed to ensure a sustainable supply of quality products; to reduce the system is environmental footprint; and to help develop sustainable communities.  
The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review 
Because agricultural products are ingredients in so many of our beverages,  the sustainability of our business depends on the health of the agricultural supply chain.  As a result,  our procurement and bottling partner teams are working together to incorporate sustainability criteria into our long-term ingredient purchasing plans.  We are still in the preliminary stages of exploring our role,  but we understand the importance of our involvement in enhancing the social and economic vitality of the farming communities throughout our supply chain.  We are committed to being a part of viable actions where possible.  In addition to monitoring the amount of water per product that the Company uses,  in partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  we are studying water use at points across our value cycle.  We want to determine whether we can achieve further—and potentially more extensive—conservation by working toward water use reductions (and better management of water) in our ingredients.  Initially,  WWF and the Company are focusing on the production of sugar from sugarcane,  a crop that uses approximately 180 liters of water for the sugar needed in one liter of Coca-Cola.  We have joined the Better Sugarcane Initiative,  a multi-stakeholder effort aimed at developing a more environmentally sustainable way of growing and producing sugarcane.  The focus is on using less water and fertilizer,  as well as fewer pesticides,  while improving labor standards.  Longer term,  WWF will also help the Company assess other ingredientssuch as oranges,  to determine if further improvements can be made in their production.

In the United States,  a key component of our diversity is a supplier base that represents our diverse customer and consumer base.  Our mission is to create maximum procurement opportunities with minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) as supplierscontractors and subcontractors of goods and services.  We seek,  build relationships withdevelop and buy from MWBE.  Supplier diversity helps develop stronger local communities while creating long-term growth and competitive advantage for our Company.  We have been committed to supplier diversity for more than 30 years,  and this commitment was further solidified in 2000 when the Company made a public pledge to spend $800 million with MWBE over a five-year period.  At the end of five years,  we exceeded that goal with more than $1 billion spent with MWBE.  In 2007 alone,  the Company spent $366 million with MWBE.  Senior executives play a critical role in ensuring that supplier diversity is embedded in all business processes and endorsing the goals of the program.  To date,  we have established a network of more than 400 supplier diversity champions who act as advocates to ensure that supplier diversity is integrated into the business routines of each business unit and the supply chain.  We are also committed to helping our suppliers succeed in the marketplace.  In 2001we started our Supplier Diversity Mentoring Program,  which serves as a viable resource for MWBE to receive a comprehensive company assessment,  coaching,  guidance and training to better position them for further business and overall growth.  This program is directed toward enhancing the capability and capacity of our suppliers.  As a result,  most of our suppliers in the program generally receive additional business with the Company and other corporations.  One of our suppliers increased its business with the Company by more than 200 percent within a year of completing our mentoring program.  Our mentoring efforts also extend outside of the Company through our partnerships with advocacy organizations to provide educational programs to MWBE.  Currently,  we partner with more than 50 national,  regional and local organizations and five universities as part of our MWBE education programs.

We are a global business based in local communities.  Across virtually all of the more than 2800 beverage products in our portfolio,  our production is local; our delivery is local; and the bulk of our impact is local.  From the production plants that bottle our beverages to the distribution and delivery of those beverages to the customers who buy our products,  we work to minimize impacts throughout our operations.  As a result,  the critical focus of our sustainability efforts is on the communities where we operate and the markets that we serve.  However,  with a system of our size and reach,  we must also step back and look at how our local operations add up to a global impact.  For example: 	 In 2007,  our system used approximately 300 billion liters of water.  	 We are one of the world is largest purchasers of sugar and high fructose corn syrup.  In our approach to environmental sustainability,  we believe there must be a clear understanding of what resources we need to ensure a strong,  sustainable business while understanding local community needs and acting responsibly to minimize the impact of our operations.  
	 We are among the world is largest purchasers of citrus and coffee.  	 We are the largest consumer of aluminum cans,  PET bottles and refillable glass bottles in the nonalcoholic beverage industry.  	 We have more than 10 million vending machines,  coolers and fountain dispensers in use around the world.  When we align the factors that drive our business with the areas where we have the greatest impact on the planet,  it takes us directly—and logically—to three major targets for our investment of time,  talent and resources: water stewardship,  sustainable packaging,  and energy management and climate protection.  In this section,  we provide a review of our efforts,  our progress in each area and a look at the work ahead for our system.

In 2007,  we used approximately 300 billion liters of water in our plants to produce beverages.  To meet our water needs while helping to conserve watersheds and improve community water access,  water stewardship leads the list of our sustainability efforts.  In 2007,  we announced our aspirational goal to return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our beverages and their production.  We call this water neutrality.  We are moving toward our goal with three objectives: 	 Reduce the amount of water used to produce our beverages.  	 Recycle water used in our manufacturing processes so it can be returned safely to the environment.  	 Replenish water in communities and nature through a global network of local partnerships and projects.  Increasingly,  plants throughout our system are replacing rinsing of our beverage packages with ionized air instead of water to further reduce the water used in our manufacturing process and increase our overall water efficiency.  
While we do not yet have a date for when we hope to attain water neutrality as a Companywe are participating in a broad,  international dialogue that will help us establish a system to measure our progress.

In 2007,  our Company operations in North America saved 26 billion gallons of water through reduction efforts across all facilities.  To accelerate our water recycling progress,  we have streamlined our wastewater system design and implemented an interactiveglobal wastewater operations management program.  
The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review 
Between 2002 and 2007,  our unit case volume increased by more than 21 percent while our global water consumption decreased by more than two percent.  We are producing more beverages with less water.  Our 2007 systemwide water use efficiency was 247 liters per liter of product.  This means that we used 247 liters of water to produce each liter of our beverages.  One liter goes into the beverage itself,  and the remaining 147 liters are used for manufacturing processes such as rinsing,  cleaning and cooling.  Systemwide,  this marks a two percent improvement over 2006.  We know we must—and will—do more to improve.  We took a step forward in 2007 by forming a multi-year partnership with World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  Working with WWF,  we have created a toolkit to help our bottling partners understand how their water use tracks with best practices within our business system.  Based on that knowledge,  we share numerous facility-specific ways to continue to improve water use efficiency.  We will announce global targets in 2008 for continued water use efficiency improvements through 2012.  Recycle 
All the water we return to the environment from our manufacturing operations (typically called wastewater) is required to meet applicable laws and regulations.  We also have an internal standard that our operations must ensure treatment of water so that it is capable of supporting aquatic life before returning it to the environment.  In some communities,  howeverwastewater treatment does not exist or does not meet a standard that protects the aquatic environment.  In these cases,  we have asked our bottling partners to build their own treatment systems on-site.  This is an expensive and time-consuming undertaking,  often cleaning water so it can be discharged into an already polluted waterway.  But we believe alignment with our global standard is critical to help preserve local water resources and demonstrate how business can be a leader in setting standards that help protect communities and nature.  Our goal is to have 100 percent of our facilities aligned with our stringent internal wastewater standards by the end of 2010.  In 2007,  85 percent of Company and bottling partners met our standards.  As we progress toward water neutrality,  actions to align our system with our wastewater standards address nearly 60 percent of our total water use (approximately 178 billion liters of the water we used in 2007).

Systemwide,  we have set a goal to offset the liters of water used in our finished beverages (approximately 122 billion liters in 2007),  through locally relevant projects that support communities and nature.  We are currently involved in more than 120 Community Water Projects in more than 50 countries.

Water Challenges 
We believe the world contains enough water to meet personal,  agricultural and business needs.  We know,  however,  that we all must improve the management of what we have.  Our Company is working to more fully understand vulnerabilities to water sources we use,  while also measuring and communicating the impact of our business on water and communities.  We will continue to consider water resources when planning new manufacturing sitesdeciding on plant closings,  making acquisitions or expanding production at existing plants.  
We are working with The Nature Conservancy to review our current community water initiatives and develop methodologies for quantifying their impact.  We also are involved with the 'Water Footprint Working Group" to develop standards and guidelines for water footprint accounting and to define the concept of water neutrality.  This work complements our engagement with the CEO Water Mandate (see page 38),  a joint initiative of the United Nations Global Compact and the government of Sweden.  The CEO Water Mandate seeks to build an international movement of committed companies working to develop strategies and solutions to help address the water challenges facing the world today.

COMMUNITY 
To bring our portfolio of beverages to consumers each day we depend on packaging.  Whether a juice drink,  sports drink,  tea or sparkling beverage,  some form of packaging is required to deliver our beverage products from where they are produced to consumers.  From an environmental perspective,  a well-designed package actually helps to prevent waste by reducing breakage,  maintaining product quality and meeting functional needs of consumers.  However,  packaging can also have significant environmental impacts related to natural resource consumption and waste disposal.  Our vision is to advance a packaging framework in which our packaging is no longer seen as waste,  but instead as a valuable resource for future use.  To realize this zero waste vision,  we are guided by a commitment to continuous improvement.  In 2007,  we continued to make strides by advancing packaging initiatives focused on three goals: 	 Reduce—To design consumer-preferred packages that use the least amount of resourceswhile maintaining product quality.  	 Recover—To build packaging management systems to collect post-consumer packaging.  	 Reuse—To use post-consumer packaging and packaging materials again to deliver sustainable value.  We are in the process of setting specific global targets,  in addition to local targets,  in all three areas and will report progress on them in future sustainability reports and on our website.

Reduce 
We aim to be the most efficient user of consumer-preferred packaging in the beverage industry.  This begins in our package development stage,  where we work to use the least amount of natural resources necessary to protect product quality and meet consumer needs.  One of the ways we conserve natural resources is by 'lightweighting"—taking weight and material out of our packaging.  Our packaging innovation teams are continually testing packages and looking for new ways to decrease our raw material use while also reducing costs.  Since their initial introductions,  we have successfully reduced the weight of our 8-ounce glass bottle by more than 50 percent,  our 12-ounce aluminum can by more than 30 percentand our 20-ounce PET bottle by 25 percent.  
Throughout our system,  we tailor our packaging to meet local economicsocial and environmental needs.  In least developed markets,  we rely more heavily on refillable bottles in order to offer greater affordability to consumers and prevent waste.  In other instanceswe adjust the amount of material used in PET bottles based on local temperatures to reduce packaging while maintaining product quality.  
As we reduce the weight of bottles and cans,  we are particularly careful to avoid simply transferring waste to another part of the packaging chain.  For example,  we do not reduce a primary package so much that it requires additional secondary or transport packaging to avoid breakage.  A key component of our progress has been our system is commitment to measuring and charting performance.  We continue to enhance tracking of our total packaging use and commission scientific studies known as life-cycle assessments (LCA) to evaluate packaging options for our total impact on the environment.  These packaging performance tools help us identify opportunities for improvement and align resources against those opportunities with the greatest potential for fulfilling our long-term goals.

	 Altstoff Recycling Austria (ARA) 
Founded in 1993,  Altstoff Recycling Austria is a nonprofit organization that manages cost-effective collection and recovery of waste packaging materials across Austria.  
Another aspect of our package development process is to evaluate the municipal waste and recycling infrastructure in the communities we serve.  The majority of our packages are 100 percent recyclable and among the most recycled consumer packages in the world as a result of our selection of materials with established economic value that typically justify their collection and reuse.  However,  sound design is only as effective as the collection process that brings used packaging back into the recycling loop.  One of the barriers to recycling in many markets around the world is the weakness of municipal and commercial collection systems for all packaging.  Our system invests millions of dollars annually to support the collection and recovery of beverage packaging materials.  There is currently no universal recovery model,  so we work in partnership with local communities around the world to help develop economically and environmentally effective solutions tailored to meet their specific needs.  In more developed markets,  this typically means supporting national recovery organizations focused on all packaging or launching our own recycling businesses.  In emerging marketswhere beverage container recycling rates tend to be higher due to informal collecting,  we focus our support on programs that improve quality of life for collectors.  In least developed marketswe predominantly rely on refillable containers that are returned and taken back for reuse.

Packaging Litter Abatement Supporting Litter Collection & Education Programs 
Though we have a robust sustainable packaging strategy,  we face litter issues in the communities we serve.  All too often our packages are found along roadsides,  beaches or in waterways.  While we have worked hard to advance community recycling programs,  we still know that public education is key to preventing litter.  Our system supports numerous litter prevention and community beautification organizations around the worldincluding 'Keep Australia Beautiful" in Australia,  the 'Tidy Britain Group" in Great Britain and 'Keep America Beautiful" in the United States.  In addition to local partners,  we have identified global partnersincluding the Ocean Conservancy and its International Coastal Cleanup (ICC)—an activity that collects,  removes and tracks millions of pounds of litter and debris from more than 33000 miles of shoreline in 76 countries.  The data collected is used to study the global waterway debris problem,  educate the public to change behaviors and find solutions.  According to the Ocean Conservancy is data analysis from 2007,  beverage containers comprise 159 percent of the total debris collected.  We have been an active sponsor of ICC for 13 years,  and in 2008 we increased our financial support with a three-year,  $1 million grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation.  In addition to donationsour associates are active participants in the ICC.

Our system has helped foster this demand by advancing sustainable technologies that enable greater use of recycled content material in our packages,  purchasing products made from recycled beverage packaging and enhancing the efficiency of our refillable bottles.  We were the first company to introduce a beverage bottle made with recycled plastic in 1991.  Since that time,  we have led the industry in our global use of recycled content PET and our direct investment in PET bottle-to-bottle recycling facilities around the world.  In 2007,  we announced our investment of more than $40 million to help build the world is largest plastic bottle-to-bottle recycling plant.  Expected to be fully operational in 2009the 30-acre facility located in the United States (Spartanburg,  South Carolina) will produce approximately 100 million pounds (the equivalent of 2 billion 20-ounce PET bottles) of PET plastic for reuse each year.  We also launched a new line of licensed merchandise in 2007 made from recycled beverage packaging materials (see page 31).  These innovative products merge trends with environmental consciousness and help remind consumers that small steps­—like recycling a bottle—can make a difference in preserving our environment.

Packaging Challenges 
Preventing packaging waste and minimizing the environmental impact of packaging is a serious challenge.  Beverage packaging is one small part of this issue,  yet it is routinely the sole focus of attention.  Imposing restrictions obstructs and ignores the real goal of integrated waste prevention.  A recent example is the call to mandate the use of compostable PET beverage bottles.  Coca-Cola has been working for more than a decade to responsibly advance the use of bio- (or plant-) based plastic materials.  As with any new package,  we have been careful to understand the full life-cycle environmental impacts of bio-based technologies before making them commercial.  Packaging life-cycle studies on the use of plant-based material for beverage bottles have demonstrated that a compostable bottle does not offer environmental benefits over existing recyclable bottles due to energy and raw material losses.  Despite making this research public,  calls for compostable bottles continue.

We believe that climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on the sustainability of our business.  Our climate protection effort starts inside the Company,  with a combination of action and education in the three areas where we have the biggest climate protection opportunity: 	 Cold-drink equipment—Improving the efficiency of our coolers,  vending machines and fountain equipment,  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions produced by this equipment.  	 Facilities and bottling plants—Improving our energy efficiency and productivity and reducing manufacturing emissions.  	 Transportation—Managing our distribution fleet to incorporate more fuel-efficient modes of product delivery.  Our system intends to purchase and put into service 100000 coolers that use CO2 as a refrigerant gas by the end of 2010—the largest deployment of this new technology by anyone in our industry to date.  
Our 2007 system greenhouse gas emissions totaled 492 million metric tons,  a 1% increase over our 2006 emissions of 486 million metric tons,  while our unit case volume grew 6% from 2006 to 2007.  
The Coca‑Cola Company  2007/2008 Sustainability Review 
Cold-Drink Equipment 
With climate change most closely associated with burning fossil fuels,  it surprises many people to learn that our single largest emission of greenhouse gases comes from keeping our beverage products cold.  Our coolers,  vending machines and fountain equipment impact the environment in three ways: energy use,  insulation foam and refrigerant in the cooling system.  In 2000,  we made a commitment to improve the energy efficiency of our cooling equipment by 40 to 50 percent by 2010.  We are well on our way to reaching that goal.  We developed a proprietary energy management system (EMS) that delivers energy savings of up to 35 percent.  We have placed 1 million of these units in markets around the world.  These 1 million units are saving an estimated 11 billion kilowatt hours per year.  In 2006,  we completed the transition to insulation foam that is free of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in all new refrigeration equipment.  Our new insulation avoids three-quarters of the direct greenhouse gas emissions from our old equipment.  Refrigerant gases are a big challenge and an even bigger leadership opportunity.  The same HFCs that we have taken out of our insulation foam also are the chemical backbone of most of the current generation of cooling equipment and an unusually potent greenhouse gas.  Interestingly,  our alternative is carbon dioxide (CO2),  which is also a greenhouse gas itself.  But when used in cooling systems,  it is 1300 times less potent than the HFC-134a we deploy in our conventional equipment.  
ENVIRONMENT 
CONTENTS 
By the end of 2007,  the Company and our bottling partners had deployed more than 8500 units of HFC-free equipment using CO2 as the refrigerant.  By the end of 2008,  we will have deployed approximately 30000 units,  including approximately 5600 for the Beijing Olympic Games.  While the new units are a small percentage of our total,  they can be a step toward a broader industry conversion.  Because CO2 equipment is presently more expensive than equipment using HFCs,  many companies have been slow to make the shift.  Our commitment to purchase 100000 CO2 coolers creates an incentive for manufacturers to increase production,  which will eventually bring down the price,  accelerating the shift to a new generation of environmentally improved cooling.  Facilities and bottling plants 
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.,  one of our largest bottling partners,  is sourcing power from 15 new on-site 'Combined Heat and Power" plants being constructed through 2009.  Use of the technology in its facility in Dunaharaszti,  Hungarycut CO2 emissions by 43% in the first year of operation.  
Across our bottling system,  we are working to grow our business,  but not our carbon emissions.  Since 2002,  our energy use efficiency has improved by 19 percent.  Going forward our efforts will be led by Project esKO,  an initiative we launched in 2007 to improve energy efficiency and productivity and reduce emissions in manufacturing.  We started with the basics­—fixing leaks,  insulating pipes,  reducing pressure and optimizing temperatures.  From here,  we are moving to investments in efficient lighting,  compressor optimization and heat recovery.  We also are making investments in combined heat and power and in renewable energy.  Together with World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  we have hosted bottling partner workshops to identify energy-saving opportunities,  and we are working with bottling partners and WWF to set global targets for continued reduction of our carbon emissions.  These targets will be announced by the end of 2008.  Energy Use TOTAL* Systemwide total (based on estimated total use)

Transportation 
While we have one of the largest distribution systems in the world,  we are able to keep our transportation footprint relatively low since our operations are largely local for bottlingproduction and delivery.  We continue to use more hybrid passenger cars for our sales force and diesel-electric hybrid delivery trucks to bring our products to market.  For exampleworking with our two largest bottling partners in the United States,  we have transitioned about 325 of the 800 vehicles used by our sales representatives to hybrids.  
By the end of 2008,  CCE will have 142 hybrid electric trucks on the road,  making theirs the largest heavy-duty hybrid electric delivery fleet in North America.  
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.  (CCE),  our largest bottling partner,  worked with suppliers to create a customized diesel-hybrid delivery truck.  It is currently the largest hybrid electric truck in wide-scale use.  By converting braking energy into supplementary electrical power,  each of these hybrid trucks becomes 37 percent more fuel-efficient than traditional delivery fleetreduces overall emissions by 32 percent,  and produces less emissions when idling or stopped in traffic.  This year,  CCE expanded its hybrid electric fleet with the addition of 120 delivery trucks to its operations.  Energy and Climate Challenges 
While we are well along in addressing the greenhouse gas emissions from our operationswe have just begun evaluating the total emission of greenhouse gases from products across their life cycle—from the growing of key ingredients to the production of raw materials used in manufacturing to packaging disposal and recycling once the products are consumed.  In 2007,  CCE began work with the Carbon Trust to assess the carbon footprint of certain products.  We will be working with the Carbon Trust and others to identify cost-effective opportunities to reduce our footprint while also exploring ways to communicate information related to a product is carbon footprint to consumers.  Our goal in any product‑related communication is to convey information that is easily understood,  credible and relevant to consumers as they make their purchase decisions.  Further information about our work with Carbon Trust will be shared on our website.

Coca‑Cola is a global business operating in more than 200 countries.  Our associates are members of thousands of local communities and represent many cultures.  We believe we have a responsibility to support economic success and continued growth of the communities in which we operate.  Our business depends on sustainable communities,  and we are in a unique position to be a positive force.  The total indirect economic impacts of the Coca-Cola system are significantly greater than the figures we present in this report.  With our bottling partners,  our beverages are produced in more than 800 plants around the world.  In addition,  our bottling partners employ hundreds of thousands of people around the world and are committed to supporting community investment programs.  Our global business stimulates job creation throughout our value cycle.  We contribute to the economic success of each community by employing local people; paying taxes to governments; paying suppliers for goods,  services and capital equipment; and supporting community investment programs.  Past independent studies on the economic impact of our business in Asia,  Africa and Eastern Europe have consistently shown that for every job in the Coca-Cola system,  an average of 10 more jobs are supported in local communities.  One recent study showed that in South Africa,  one job in the Coca‑Cola system indirectly supported 16 additional jobs throughout our value cycle.  Small,  independent retailers form the backbone of our business in many parts of the world.  Our system helps these small retailers and vendors build their businesses and become our business partners.  We often help small businesses get off the ground with an initial injection of support—in the form of equipment and training—and then we work with them as business partners and suppliers.  From our pushcart programs in Vietnam,  which have helped more than 4000 retailers establish their businesses to date,  to our Manual Distribution Centers in East Africa (see page 50),  we continuously work to provide local economic opportunity.

Supporting Small Business Development Manual Distribution Centers 
Our Manual Distribution Center (MDC) model in Africa has created jobs,  promoted entrepreneurship and strengthened local economies.  To date,  approximately 1800 small distribution businesses have been formed,  creating direct employment for more than 7500 people and generating more than $500 million in revenues,  primarily in high‑density urban areas throughout East Africa,  including Ethiopia,  KenyaMozambique,  Tanzania and Uganda.  The MDC model identifies and engages independent entrepreneurs that distribute and sell our beverages in smallspecific geographical areas.  MDCs are typically located in areas where a lack of stable roads and infrastructure makes it difficult for delivery trucks to travel,  which helps our Company secure hard-to-reach markets while creating wealth and job growth in those communities.  Those who set up MDCs employ others in the area,  who then sell and distribute our beverage products to retailers,  often by bicycle or pushcart.  As a result of the MDC program is success,  we are expanding our MDCs across Africa with the goal of creating between 1300 and 2000 new independent distribution businesses and between 5300 and 8400 new jobs in Africa by 2010.

Our system is in a unique position to provide assistance during and after natural disasters.  Because we have such a large distribution network,  we can deliver necessities to some communities that are not easily accessible.  We feel fortunate to be able to help those in dire need,  from providing bottled water to using our delivery vehicles for aid distribution and associate volunteerism.  Disaster preparedness can be just as important as disaster relief.  In Thailand,  we have a partnership with the Thai Red Cross Society that involves an intensive training program on first aid and disaster-relief basics,  conducted by the Red Cross.  Approximately 500 Coca-Cola system associates across the country have participated and are prepared for a decentralized rapid-response deployment in emergencies.  
CHINA EARTHQUAKE 
In China,  Coca-Cola has donated and pledged $28 million in cash and in-kind donations to the victims of the devastating 2008 earthquake in Sichuan.  In the early hours following the earthquake,  our operations began providing aid relief,  such as clean drinking water and financial support,  to the victims and rescue workers.  During the three days of national mourning,  we stopped all advertisement in China,  including television commercials.  
To support the relief efforts in Myanmar,  The Coca-Cola Foundation Thailand worked with Thai humanitarian and government organizations to provide 240000 bottles of 600‑mL Namthip bottled water to the victims of Cyclone Nargis,  which tore through southern Myanmar in May 2008.  Half of the bottles were donated to the Thai Red Cross Society as part of the Foundation is existing  Namthip gives to Red Cross" partnership.  We donated another 120000 bottles of Namthip water to Thailand is Ministry of Public Health,  which collected donations of drinking water and canned food from the Thai public to be transported to Myanmar.  Even though we do not have any business operations in Myanmar,  the Coca-Cola system has actively supported the ongoing relief efforts in the country by working with Thai humanitarian and government organizations.  In 2007,  flooding swept through two states in Mexico,  leaving residents without shelter,  foodwater and clothing.  Our system helped with donations and distribution of 15 million liters of bottled water and beverages; medicine and basic supplies; tents for temporary shelter; and the use of our distribution center for delivery of these much-needed supplies.  And,  villages in Aceh,  Indonesia,  are still suffering from the effects of the 2004 tsunami.

Today it is estimated that as many as 17 billion adults and children around the word are overweight or obese,  a condition that increases the risk for chronic,  non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes.  Obesity is a complex global problem influenced by many factors,  including genetics,  eating behaviors,  physical activity patterns,  psychological issues,  cultural aspects and social frameworks.  However,  the fundamental underlying factor is an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended through basic metabolic processes and physical activity.  Our Company aspires to provide workable solutions that foster active,  healthy living— solutions that can lead to improved health through our commitments,  our actions and our dedication of resources.  The Coca-Cola system sponsors the 'Fuoriclasse Cup" in Italy,  which promotes active living among young people.  To date,  it has reached approximately 3 million students in more than 12000 Italian schools.  
'Happy Playtime, " a program we support in China,  was launched in 2004.  Today Happy Playtime is in 22 cities and is expected to reach more than 17 million students in approximately 2000 schools.  
We are also committed to develop and create programs that support active,  healthy livingin particular through physical activity and nutrition education programs in collaboration with governmental agencies and health experts.  Millions of young people and adults have participated in Coca‑Cola-sponsored activities in their communities.  In June 2007,  we committed $25 million over five years to our national parks in the United States.  This support is in partnership with the National Park Foundation and will assist with trail creation,  enhancement and restoration.  Additionally,  there will be community and youth engagement in the stewardship and health benefits of our national parks.  Many of our programs in Latin America focus on inspiring young people to learn and incorporate healthy choices,  including exercise,  into their lives.
