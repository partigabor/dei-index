 Letter from Indra Nooyi 
On the surface,  profit is a word that is easily defined: to make money.  In reality,  however,  that definition is incomplete.  In a world that is being radically reshaped by sweeping forces of change — ​f rom technological innovation and globalization to resource scarcity,  climate change and public health challenges — ​ how companies make money is just as important as how much money they make.  Without question,  profits are the engine that propels a corporation forward.  But the blind pursuit of profit at all costs is untenable.  It is essential that we make money the right way.  After all,  if communities suffer as a result of a company is actions,  those returns are not sustainable.  Today,  a company is profits are inextricably tied to the prosperity of its consumers,  customersemployees,  communities and society writ large.  More than ever before,  profitability and sustainability are synonymous.  Corporations should embrace this new way of doing business.  Profitable companies of the 21st century will be those that align the needs of their business with the needs of the world around them.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2014 
With this in mind,  PepsiCo looked out across the food and beverage landscape nearly a decade ago and charted a new course.  We recognized a simple truth: there is profit in purpose.  Sustainability is not something to support with the profits we make,  but rather a path to delivering profitability.  Weaving sustainability into the very fabric of our organization is a way to help f­ uture-proof our business for the changing world around us.  At PepsiCo,  we focus on three pillars of ­sustainability: Human,  Environmental and Talent.  We are working to improve the nutritional profile of our products and offer a wider selection of nutritious foods and beverages in response to growing consumer demand.  We are striving to reduce our impact on the environment and conserve natural resourcesreducing our operating costs in the process.  And we are continuously investing to build a diverse and engaging culture inside PepsiCo that allows us to attract the next generation of talent we need to propel our company forward.  These three pillars form the foundation of what we call Performance with Purpose,  and they help to drive our financial results.  The report that follows describes the significant progress we made in each of these areas in 2014.  We are particularly proud to report that PepsiCo achieved four of our environmental goals ahead of schedule.  
As one of North America is largest fleet operators,  PepsiCo utilizes all-electric and hybrid trucks,  and uses alternative fuels to increase efficiency and cut emissions.  It is clear that in the years and decades aheadthe private sector will be increasingly impacted by global environmental and social challenges that no single company,  industry,  government or nongovernmental organization (NGO) can address alone.  Collaborative solutions,  in which we all play our role,  hold the key to meaningful and lasting progress.  The strongest cross-­sector partnerships flourish when each member engages in constructive dialogue.  This dialogue is,  at times,  lacking today.  For example,  the relationship between corporations and some NGOs can be purely adversarial.  While NGOs should absolutely push hard for companies to change,  they should also acknowledge when companies set thoughtful goals and take serious steps to achieve them.  We share many common objectives and must find more opportunities to join hands rather than simply pointing fingers.  For our part,  PepsiCo is fully committed to engaging partners who seek progress on our shared challenges.  We are proud of the relationships we have built with many highly respected organizations around the world.  Moving forward,  we intend to expand and strengthen these partnerships.  The NGO community brings in-depth experience and local knowledge that is critical to solving big problems,  and we will continue seeking new opportunities to work together on topics most significant to our business and on which we can make a meaningful impact.  
Simply put,  we need cooperation at all levels.  As such,  the private sector must step forward and offer its unique capabilities to develop new solutions,  uncover new opportunities andultimately,  build the viable,  trusted companies of tomorrow.  That is why PepsiCo is more committed to Performance with Purpose than ever before.  It is how we will position our business for ­sustainable long-term growth and contribute to solving broader challenges that impact each and every one of us.  In this report,  you will see how we are ­achieving progress through sustainable ­agricultural practices,  innovative methods of water conservation,  more nutritious product offerings and more diverse workplaces.  These efforts don't come at the expense of profit.  Rather,  they are examples of just some of the work underway that we are confident will help fuel our profits for generations to come.

Performance with Purpose 
Performance with Purpose is our vision to deliver top-tier financial performance over the long term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy,  leaving a positive imprint on society and the environment.  We do this in part by offering a wide range of products; increasing the number of our nutritious foods and beverages; reducing our environmental impacts; and supporting our employees and the communities where we do business; all of which will help position the company for long-term sustainable growth.  
The Pillars of Performance with Purpose We have established 10 strategic goals across our key impact areas — ​ our products (Human Sustainability),  the environment (Environmental Sustainability),  and our people (Talent Sustainability) — ​to bring the Performance with Purpose vision to life.  Human — ​We work to improve the nutritional profile of our products and to offer a wider selection of nutritious foods and beverages,  which we market and sell responsibly.  Environmental — ​We work to minimize our impact on the environment and to conserve natural resources throughout our operations and our supply chain.  Talent — ​We work to build a culture of diversity and engagementand to ensure those in our supply chain are supported and treated with respect.

 Discussion with Dr.  Mehmood Khan 
Continual learning.  Reinvention.  The dynamics that have shaped my career — ​from starting as a physician to heading up Research & Development at a top pharmaceutical company to becoming the first Chief Scientific Officer at PepsiCo and Chair of its Sustainability Council — ​are at work as our company delivers Performance with Purpose.  PepsiCo begins with ingredients.  
PepsiCo Vice Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer,  Global Research & Development 
For PepsiCo,  sourcing ingredients more ­sustainably means optimizing quality and cost in the short term,  and being responsible in how we use natural resources,  interact with our growers,  and select crops for nutrition and yield over the long term.  Our Sustainable Farming Initiative helps farmers meet our socialeconomic and environmental standards,  and is one of the ways sustainability is integrated into our business globally.  Our work in sourcing extends to how we support infrastructure,  jobs and,  ultimately,  more sustainable communities where we do business.  
PepsiCo is doing more with less.  Across our value chain,  PepsiCo strives to ­minimize our overall impact on the environment and conserve natural resources.  Because of its ties to agriculture,  which is responsible for 70 percent of the world is freshwater use,  the food and beverage industry is well positioned to address global water challenges.  By driving down our operational water use,  promoting innovative agricultural practices that use less water,  working toward responsible watershed management and enabling access to safe water for millions of people in communities around the world,  PepsiCo is doing just that.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2014 
We also continue to align with global efforts to address climate change,  making reductions in our energy use and greenhouse gas emissions while producing more than one billion servings each day.  And we are finding new ways to reduce packaging material and waste with key partners.  
PepsiCo continues to innovate in nutrition.  As consumers look for more choices in convenient foods and beverages,  and health conditions such as obesity and diabetes are prevalent,  PepsiCo is transforming our offerings,  adding more whole grains,  fruit,  fiber and vegetables to our portfolio; innovating our recipes; and reducing portion sizes.  
PepsiCo is impact is global.  Our expertise,  size and engagement with ­stakeholders around the world position us to make a meaningful difference in some of today is most pressing issues,  creating efficiencies and positive changes in areas where we work.  PepsiCo embraces this responsibility and is committed to continual learning and reinvention.  We integrate sustainability into our business and strive to act as a force for good in the world as we deliver Performance with Purpose.

Global Challenge 
Intensified Focus on Health and Wellness Challenges in malnutrition and health and wellness are having a significant impact on societies around the world.  According to the World Food Programme,  enough food is made to feed everyone around the world,  yet nearly 900 million people still go to bed hungry each night,  mostly in emerging markets.  At the same time,  we know from the World Health Organization (WHO) that in developed countries,  more than 19 billion adults were overweight in 2014.  Studies link the growing rates of over-­nutrition and obesity worldwide to a rise in chronic diseases such as cancercardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Against this troubling backdrop,  many consumers are increasingly focused on ­making more nutritious or informed choices when shopping for food and beverages.  Yet this task is often met with mixed messaging around dietary guidelines,  ingredients and processes from different authorities and stakeholders around the world.  The truth is that what we choose to eat and drink is inherently cultural and extremely personal.  Trying to make the right decisions on what to feed ourselves and our families has never been more complicated.

Today,  PepsiCo is world-class Research & Development (R&D) team is advancing our work in this area,  driving innovation across our product portfolios and creating new opportunities for our business.  Because we recognize that we cannot solve global public health challenges alone,  we also engage with our peers in the food and beverage industry,  NGOs,  governments and other stakeholders to support collaborative solutions.  
As one of the world is leading food and beverage companies,  we at PepsiCo are taking steps to enable consumers to make more informed choices,  and we are looking to capture the growth opportunity presented by offering more nutritious options.  In fact,  in 2014,  about 20 percent of our net revenues came from our nutrition businesses.  We continue to focus on ways to reduce sodium,  added sugars and saturated fats in our foods and beverages.  We also work to clearly label what is in our products.  And we aim to sell and market our products responsibly — ​especially when it comes to young consumers.  We call this focus on our products Human Sustainability.

PepsiCo Turkey has delivered reductions in sodium,  saturated fats and added sugars and offers a range of convenient products — ​ including Tropicana,  which uses popular local fruits.  
Human Sustainability 
For more information,  see our microsite.  Human Sustainability is our strategic approach to health and nutrition in our product portfolio and is a key pillar of Performance with Purpose.  In 2009,  PepsiCo set ambitious Human Sustainability goals,  underpinned by metrics and policiesand we are pleased to share our progress with you below.  
 Continue to refine our food and beverage choices to meet changing consumer needs by reducing sodiumadded sugars and saturated fats,  and developing a broader portfolio of product choices 02 
Sodium Our 2020 goal is to reduce the average Sodium −10% amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands in key countries by 25 percentcompared to a 2006 baseline.  In 2014,  all 10 key countries* we track for these goals achieved sodium reductions.  In fact,  through 2014 China and the U.K.  have already met our 25 percent reduction target in key brands.  On a global average per serving basis,  we reduced sodium by more than 10 percent and removed more than 1800 metric tons from key global food brands in key countries in 2014,  compared to 2006.  Advances in manufacturing technology and recipe innovation have helped us maintain the taste our consumers expect while reducing sodium content.  Our primary challenge in meeting this goal is consumer acceptance of ­reduced-­sodium products in countries like the U.S.  and Saudi Arabiaand we continue to prioritize its reduction in our flavored chips,  as some ­seasonings can be high in sodium.  We will continue to invest in R&D toward sodium reductions to help people achieve levels recommended by public health experts,  such as the WHO.  
Added Sugars We set a goal to reduce the average amount of added sugars per serving in our beverages in key countries* by 25 percent by 2020,  compared to a 2006 baseline.  Although our goal with respect to reducing added sugars applies only to key global beverage brands,  we measure our progress against all beverage brands.  Seven of the 10 key countries we track for this goal have reduced added sugars in 2014 compared to our 2006 baseline.  Two of these seven key ­countries Added Sugars 
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2014 
the U.S.  and Canada,  together reported removing approximately 434000 metric tons of added sugars from the total beverage portfolioup from 402000 in 2013,  as a result of actively managing the portfolio and offering a mix of products.  Despite this progress,  on a global average basis we saw a net increase in metric tons of added sugars in 2014.  In certain key countries,  while there have been some successful products with reduced added sugars,  the original versions of our products are growing at faster rates due in part to consumer preference.  This increases the average added sugars per serving and thereby impacts the aggregated average.  Our greatest challenges in meeting this goal will be our performance in India and China,  where the markets are growing so rapidly that it is more difficult to predict sales and consumer acceptability.  We are accelerating R&D investments to uncover and develop great-­tasting sweeteners and flavors that are inherently low in calories and that we believe will enable us to make progress toward this goal.  
Saturated Fats We set a goal of reducing the average amount of saturated fats per serving in key global food brands in key countries* by 15 percent by 2020,  compared to a 2006 baseline.  Five of the 10 countries we measure against this goal have already met the 15 percent target,  and Turkey has removed 35 percent of the saturated fats from its key brands in 2014 compared to 2006.  On a global average per serving basis,  we reduced saturated fats by just over 2 percent and removed 1600 metric tons of saturated fats in 2014,  compared to the 2006 baseline.  Higher volume growth in markets where healthier oils are less accessible has proven to be a challenge for us,  and we continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce saturated fats and use healthier oils in our products.  
 10 of our 
key countries have reduced average added sugars per serving in 2014 compared to our 2006 baseline 
Broadening Our Portfolio In 2014,  approximately 20 percent of net revenue came from PepsiCo is nutrition businesses.  We plan to further expand our more nutritious portfolio by building on our e­ xpertise in dairy,  hummus and baked grain snacks,  as well as leveraging our brands,  including Quaker,  Tropicana,  Gatorade,  Naked Juice Emerging Brands and Wimm-Bill-Dann.  
Revenue Contribution from Nutrition Business 
 Continue to provide clear nutrition information on our products,  and sell and market them appropriately to our consumers,  including children,  in line with our global policies and accepted global standards 03 
Nutritional Labeling In 2010,  PepsiCo voluntarily committed to display calorie count and key nutrients on our packaging — ​where feasible and where permissible by local regulations — ​for all of our products in key countries* by year-end 2015.  In 2014,  PepsiCo achieved over 92 percent compliance with this commitment.  In 2014,  we also made significant improvements in our methodology for monitoring compliance with our labeling policy.  These enhancements will provide greater consistency and reliability in the monitoring process.  For more information on our l­abeling goal methodology and performance,  please see the 2014 GRI Report.  
Labeled Products 
Responsible Advertising We understand that it is essential to ­advertise our products responsibly.  We ensure that our marketing campaigns reflect PepsiCo is Values and that we market only our most nutritious products to children.

Understanding the urgency of current global crises,  we are working to establish new goals and performance metrics to build upon our environmental sustainability progress.  We are also adapting to meet the changing needs of our business and beyond.  And as always,  we will continue to seek expert advice from key stakeholders to inform our thinking and targets.

At PepsiCo,  we rely on the continued availability of water to grow the fruits­vegetables,  grains and other commodities essential to our products; to run manu­ fac­turing processes; to serve as the key ingredient for most of our beverages; and to be a foundational prerequisite for healthy communities around the world; making water stewardship a key focus area for us.  We are also working to achieve an absolute reduction in our GHG emissions by reducing energy use in our manufacturing and delivery operations.  We are utilizing renewable alternatives to fossil fuels; improving the efficiency of our delivery truck fleets; and working with suppliers — ​especially farmers — ​to help them manage and reduce their energy and water use and emissions.  We rely on the PepsiCo Resource Conservation Program (ReCon) to scale best practices in the conservation of water and energy and in the reduction of emissions and waste across PepsiCo facilities and among key business partners.

According to recent studies,  by 2025 18 billion people will be living in regions with absolute water scarcity.  By 2030,  it is expected that greater demand for food will require an increase in production of 50 percent or a substantial reduction in the amount of food currently wasted or lost (35–50 percent) throughout the value chain.  And if GHG emissions continue unabated,  global average temperatures could exceed a rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-­industrial levels by 2045.  The 2°C increase is regarded by the scientific community as the upper limit to minimize exposure to increasingly dangerous forest fires,  extreme weather,  drought and other impacts.  Moreover,  these acute global problems will need to be addressed all while demand for the world is resources is increasing at an unprecedented rate.  Managing the interrelationship between agriculture,  climate change,  energy and water will be crucial for businesses seeking long-term sustainable growth.

Environmental Sustainability 
Human right to water: During 2014,  PepsiCo and other companies endorsing the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate developed a guide for effectively aligning corporate water stewardship with the corporate responsibility to respect the human right to water and sanitation.  
 strategic approach to water throughout our value chain In 2009,  PepsiCo launched a global water strategy to respect the human right to water through world-class e­ fficiency in our operations,  preserving water resources and enabling access to safe water.  Today,  we implement this strategy across our value chain.  
In our supply chain: In 2014,  we continued to work with farmers to develop effective water management plans for addressing water risk and share best practice water-­efficient drip irrigation methods.  
In our operations: During 2014,  we decreased absolute water use by approximately one billion liters and realized approximately $17 million in cost savings.  
In 2014,  PepsiCo India worked with five townships to identify water-saving programsincluding check damstraditional wells and recharge ponds,  benefiting the livelihoods of more than 50000 people.  
In our communities: In 2014,  the PepsiCo Foundation worked with our partners to help local communities in Mexico,  BrazilJordan,  China,  Colombia and India better manage and efficiently use water.  
PepsiCo Sustainability Report 2014 
04  Help protect and conserve global water suppliesespecially in water-­stressed areas,  and provide access to safe water 
Protect and Conserve Water 
In our watersheds: 
We continue to deliver progress across our most significant areas: water,  packaging,  wasteenergy and agriculture — ​areas that are critical to our business and where we can make the biggest impact.  Our 2015 targets — ​specifically related to these areas — ​help shape our performance.  We are proud to report early achievement of four of our environmental goals in 2014,  as illustrated below.  
Our business relies on water to grow the raw materials for our productsto enable our manufacturing processes,  and to serve as the key ingredient for most of our beverages.  In 2009,  PepsiCo launched a global water strategy to respect the human right to water.  Today,  we implement this strategy through watershed management,  conserving water within our operations,  reducing water use in our agricultural supply chain and helping to provide access to safe water within communities.  By the end of 2014,  we reduced our water use per unit of production in legacy operations1 by 23 percent since 2006,  exceeding our target of a 20 percent reduction by the end of 2015 and delivering cost savings of approximately $17 million in 2014.  Through the PepsiCo Foundationwe also met our 2015 goal of partnering to provide access to safe water to 6 million people a year early.  
Operational Water Use 
05  Innovate our packaging to make it increasingly sustainable,  minimizing our impact on the environment 
Reduce Impact on the Environment from Packaging In 2014,  we met our goal to reduce packaging weight and size and to increase post-consumer recycled content in our packaging.  
Packaging Materials 
−89MM lbs 
For more information,  see our microsite.  
We removed over 89 million pounds of packaging materials from the market compared to the prior year,  resulting in $48 million of cost savings.  In 2014,  we also used over 130 million pounds of foodgrade recycled polyethylene ­terephthalate (rPET) in our packagingan increase of nearly 25 percent versus 2013.  In addition to these efforts,  we are working to help increase the percentage of beverage containers recycled in the U.S.  For more on our recycling i­nitiativessee our 2014 GRI Report.  06  Work to eliminate solid waste to landfills from our production facilities 
Eliminate Waste to Landfills In 2014,  PepsiCo sent approximately 7 percent of its waste to landfill (93% diverted).  This surpassed our goal of recycling and reusing 90 percent of our waste,  and resulted in estimated savings of $35 million compared to 2009.  
Waste Recycled and Reused 
07  Work to achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our global businesses 
Reduce GHG Emissions In 2014,  we made strong progress in holding absolute GHG emissions for legacy operations1 flat against a 2008 baseline despite significant production volume growth in our business.  Through best practice programs like ReCon and our pursuit of greener fleet initiatives,  we have improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by nearly 16 percent compared with our 2006 baseline.  We will also continue to deploy advanced beverage vending and cooling equipment and address the impacts of our packaging,  which affect our overall emissions.  While we remain committed to ongoing energy efficiency in our own operationswe know that the biggest impact we can have on reducing GHG emissions is by continuing to work with suppliers along our value chain.  
Energy Use Intensity 
1. 	 Our water and energy conservation goals apply to global 'legacy" operations as they existed in 2006,  and exclude major acquisitions and mergers while accounting for divestitures after the 2006 baseline year.  
08  Continue to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers 
Support Sustainable Agriculture We are successfully expanding best 11 ­practices in sustainable agriculture.  To set standards of sustainability performance for the agricultural products on which PepsiCo depends,  we developed a Sustainable Agriculture Policy that is supported by our Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI).  The SFI guides our suppliers in sustainable farming practices and provides them with resources,  training and support to help meet our social,  economic and environmental standards.  In 2014,  the SFI expanded its global ­coverage,  with implementation across 11 countries,  to nearly 600 growers of potatoes,  corn and citrus (up from 500 in 2013),  covering in excess of 450000 acres of direct cropping land (compared to 360000 in 2013).  
Number of Countries Using Sustainable Farming Initiative 
We are also committed,  through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),  to exclusively purchase 100 percent RSPO-­certified sustainable palm oil for our products by 2015.  We are working with our suppliers to achieve 100 percent traceability to the mill level by 2016.  For more information,  see our PepsiCo Palm Oil Commitments on our website.  
50 in 5 We have been working with farmers in waterstressed areas of the U.K.  to reduce the carbon footprint and water used to grow potatoes for our Walkers crisps by half over a five-year period.  We are on target to reach both our water and carbon footprint goals by the end of 2015.

Global Challenge 
The Talent Conundrum Despite persistently high unemployment levels around the world,  many employers are finding it difficult to meet their talent needs.  Populations are aging,  which is leading to a shrinking workforce.  At the same timethere are not enough new graduates with the specific skills needed in today is economy,  especially in the science,  technology,  engineering and math fields.  As issues of tolerance,  identity,  participation,  dignity and justice come to the fore,  a key measure of a company is social responsibility is its respect for human rights.  While most companies recognize the moral imperative to operate consistently with human rights principles,  awareness is growing that respect for human rights can also be a tool for improving business performance with regard to risk mitigation and earning a social license to operate.
