2006 Corporate Responsibility Review 
The mark we make today shapes the future.  
We may be best known for the shape of our bottlebut we are also passionate about shaping the world —  one community at a time.  Each of us leaves a mark on the planet and on one another.  At The Coca‑Cola Company,  we are committed to making a positive mark on communities and minimizing our impact on the planet.  Together with our bottling partners and suppliers,  other businesses,  community leadersgovernments and nongovernmental organizations,  we are working to improve lives,  fuel local economies and protect the environment.  That is the mark we want to make.

'As we create value for our shareowners and other stakeholders by running a successful business,  we must also be a force for positive global change  — one community at a time.  We must help create economic and social value,  protect the environment and contribute to the long-term sustainability of every community we serve. " E.  Neville Isdell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
We like to say that magic is one of the secret ingredients in our beverages.  I believe a big part of that magic has always been the spirit of optimism and hope that has shaped our Company since the first glass of Coca‑Cola was poured 121 years ago.  Today is world is very different from what it was in 1886.  Optimism and hope are more important than ever — and increasingly harder to find.  Our role in this changing,  challenging world can be captured in a single sentence: We must refresh the world responsibly.  Through the years,  responsibility has been framed in terms of citizenship and philanthropy.  And,  certainlyboth of these are important.  But it is time to raise our expectations and work toward the sustainability of our communities.  What does this have to do with creating and selling consumer products? Today,  everything.  Recently,  I spoke at the United Nations Global Compact Leaders Summit about my thoughts on business as an agent of global transformation.  I challenged the business leaders in the audience to speak up,  step up and scale up — to leverage our combined efforts through concerted,  coordinated and cooperative global action.  The urgency of this message stems from my experiences.  Each time I travel around the world,  each time I talk to people in local markets,  I become more convinced that the time to take meaningful action is growing short.  2	 
The Coca‑Cola Company 
We have one planet,  and many parts of it are under stress — from population growth,  shrinking supplies of clean water,  climate change and conflict.  Meaningful change in addressing these global issues requires collaboration and commitment.  Our impact is magnified when we work with others: our bottling partners,  suppliers,  other businesseslocal communities,  governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).  Because The Coca‑Cola Company is a local business on a global scale,  the issues that challenge the sustainability of communities in the more than 200 countries we serve also challenge the sustainability of our business.  Our business cannot hope to thrive long term unless our consumers do; we cannot hope to prosper unless our associates and communities do.  This report cites many examples of that belief in action.  And we believe no issue is more important —  or urgent — than access to clean,  safe water for communities around the world.  That is why,  in June 2007,  we pledged to replace every drop of water we use in our beverages and their production.  This goal is,  admittedly,  aspirational.  It will be a multi-year journey for our Company and our bottling partners.  We are also focusing on reducing our carbon footprint and increasing the sustainability of our packaging.  Muhtar Kent,  our Company is president and chief operating officer,  discusses some of these initiatives in his message to you.  
We are committed to: Refreshing the world in bodymind and spirit by anticipating our consumers' desires and needs Providing great jobs and protecting the workplace rights of all our associates 
Replacing every drop of water we use 
Growing our business but not our carbon footprint 
Designing packaging that will be seen as a valuable resource for future use 
Helping to improve the well-being of the people in the communities where we operate 
We understand that our contribution to helping build sustainable communities extends beyond the environmental impacts of our business.  We are also committed to the health and well-being of the people our business touches,  including the men and women of The Coca‑Cola Company.  We are committed to protecting the workplace rights of all our associates.  In January 2007,  we launched our global Workplace Rights Policy,  which was guided by the principles developed by the United Nations International Labor Organization and many other well-known human rights organizations.  Our Workplace Rights Policy formalizes our long-standing commitment to ensuring that each one of our approximately 71000 associates around the world is treated fairly and with dignity.  Our business contributes to the well-being of communities through economic development.  From the truck driver who delivers our beverages to the retailer who sells them,  we support local economies.  A study conducted in South Africa demonstrated that for every job created by the Coca-Cola systeman additional 16 jobs are created indirectly.  I have a deep and personal belief about our responsibilities to the communities and people we serve.  This Company has been a major part of my life for more than 40 years,  and I think a lot about the mark The Coca‑Cola Company will leave on the world.  
to use our strengths and our presence to help protect the health of our planet and to improve the lives of the people who inhabit it.  No company can aspire to have that kind of impact by working — or thinking — alone.  Change is a group effort,  crossing governments,  NGOs,  individuals and businesses.  Working together is the only way that we can create solutions equal to the issues we all face.  For all the complexity of finding solutions to these issues,  the basic idea is simple: Imagine what could happen if every organization,  every community,  every individual simply did what is right — for the planet,  and for all who share it.  Global business is rich in talent and resources.  Now is the time to engage and combine our strengths to create a better world.  Speaking for the people of The Coca‑Cola Company around the world,  we are already on the job.  Sincerely E.  Neville Isdell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Coca‑Cola Company August 2007 
In this era of great need and unique opportunity,  we intend to create positive change.  We are determined

'When you live and work in the local communities you serve … when your business depends on the vibrancy of these local communities for its very survival,  it shapes your philosophy about how you conduct yourself. " Muhtar Kent President and Chief Operating Officer 
Neville and I realize that the future of our business depends on the vitality of the communities where we operate.  We think about the impact our business has on the local environment,  the people we hire and local communities.  We know that the continued health and sustainable growth of our business depends on the long-term health of the communities that surround it.  Today,  our business is healthy and growing — with improved alignment within our bottling system and a proven business strategy that is generating results.  Unit case volume growth is at its highest level in years.  And,  most importantly,  we are focused on sustaining those results,  by working to improve our operating efficiencies and effectiveness,  and by better collaborating and engaging with our bottling partners.  The continued health of our business requires reinvigorating top-line growth,  across our portfolio and around the world,  and enhancing and protecting our bottom line.  We must be profitable in order to sustain our investment in communities around the world.  We are continuing to increase our productivity andultimately,  to be as close to our local markets — and our local bottling partners — as possible.  Working smarter means identifying new opportunities for growth,  bringing innovations to the marketplacestreamlining processes,  minimizing costs and maximizing our marketing investments.  
The Coca‑Cola Company 
As we work on our own long-term sustainabilitywe continue to focus on our three key pillars: consumer marketing,  commercial leadership and franchise leadership.  Consumer marketing is about expanding consumer preference through a broad and balanced portfolio of more than 400 brands and 2600 beverage productsexpanded nutrition labeling,  options in packaging sizeand responsible marketing.  Commercial leadership relates to our customer and supplier partnerships.  We are building longterm relationships that help us sell more beverages and,  at the same time,  help us create positive change in the communities where we work and live.  We recently updated our Supplier Guiding Principles to partner more effectively with our suppliers,  holding them and ourselves to higher standards of conduct and responsibility.  Franchise leadership refers to the relationships we have with our bottling partners.  We do not own or manage most of our bottlers; they are independentlocal companies running their own businesses.  But we strive to work closely together to strengthen the Coca‑Cola system.  The bottlers we do own are managed by our Bottling Investments operating group,  the second-largest bottler of Coca‑Cola products in the world in terms 
Transforming our business and contributing to sustainable communities by: Strengthening Consumer Marketing: expanding consumer preference for our brands,  and fueling the growth of both sparkling and still beverages 
Enhancing Commercial Leadership: creating long-term relationships with our customers and suppliers for mutual benefit 
of unit case volume.  Together with our bottling and supplier partners,  we are working toward contributing to the sustainability of the Coca‑Cola business and the communities we serve.  We also are taking steps to improve our social and environmental footprint.  These actions are becoming more integrated into our business processes than ever before.  Our environmental efforts focus on water stewardshipsustainable packaging,  and energy and climate protection.  From our water stewardship to reducing our raw material and energy use,  we strive not only to grow our business profitably and minimize our environmental impacts but also to preserve and protect natural resources.  We are improving energy efficiency in our manufacturing process and our refrigeration and insulation equipment.  Since we began reporting our energy performance externally in 2002,  the Coca‑Cola system is energy efficiency has improved 16 percent.  We continue to reduce our carbon footprint through energy-efficienthydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free vending machines and coolers and our collaborative 'Refrigerants,  Naturally!" partnership with other companies and NGOs.  We see our packaging not as waste but as a valuable resource for future use.  And we continue to invest in PET bottle-to-bottle recycling plants to help the

Coca-Cola system reduce waste.  The first plant opened in Australia in 1994,  and in 2007 the fifth plant opened in Austria.  These actions illustrate our ongoing dedication to environmental stewardship and growing our business sustainably and responsibly.  We publicly reaffirmed our commitment to conducting our business responsibly when we became a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in March 2006.  Through the UN Global CompactThe Coca‑Cola Company agrees to 'embracesupport and enact" a set of core values in the areas of human rights,  labor standards,  the environment and anti-corruption.  Many of our bottling partners are also signatories to the UN Global Compact.  Our Company is committed to making a positive mark on the world.  We hope our actions encourage others to consider the mark they choose to leave.  Sincerely Muhtar Kent President and Chief Operating Officer The Coca‑Cola Company August 2007

Metrics 
Stakeholders and Feedback 
Our reporting on corporate responsibility is still evolving,  and we are working to employ better and improved metrics.  While we discuss initiatives and programs,  as well as progress from year to year,  we recognize the need to report quantifiable metrics and targets,  in particular as they relate to our social performance and economic impact.  
Since publishing our last Corporate Responsibility Review,  we have conducted several feedback sessions with many internal and external stakeholders.  Our stakeholders include shareowners,  associates,  bottling partners,  suppliers,  governments,  NGOscustomers and consumers.  We have used their feedback to help shape this current report.  
On pages 14 and 15 we provide a summary of various performance metrics.  We are working toward mapping corporate responsibility issuesprioritizing them and determining what will be discussed in our next Corporate Responsibility Review.  We are also developing the necessary systems and targets to gauge our performance and to consistently gather global data.  Coca‑Cola Systemwide Performance In April 2007,  associates from The Coca‑Cola  Company and several of our largest bottling partners met for the first time to discuss the development of a core set of performance indicators for the Coca‑Cola system.  Working groups of Company associates and representatives from our bottling partners have been formed to determine the feasibility — due to the legal and management complexity of the Coca‑Cola system (see page 10) — of collecting 
Following are the main areas noted for improvement by various stakeholders: 	 Better demonstrate the integration of corporate responsibility into business strategy 	 Explain The Coca‑Cola Company franchise system — bottlers and the Company 	 Align performance with clearly articulated internal and external standards or frameworks 	 Include more third-party input and feedback 	 Balance reporting — include the good and the bad In 2006,  we established a Corporate Responsibility Review email address and received many email comments from stakeholders.

Frameworks and Principles We use internal and external frameworksstandards and principles to guide our approach to corporate responsibility and our progress toward helping to build sustainable communities.  Internal Frameworks Developed and implemented in 2005,  the five key areas of our Manifesto for Growth guide the way in which our Company conducts business.  Continual collaboration with our bottling partners is integral to our long-term success.  Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: 	 People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be 	 Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipate and satisfy people is desires and needs 	 Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty 	 Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference 	 Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities In 2002,  Citizenship[at]Coca‑Cola was established as a voluntary set of principles between our Company and our largest bottling partners.  This framework focuses on four key areas: workplacemarketplace,  environment and community.

Business Profile The Coca‑Cola Company 
The Coca‑Cola System 
Established in 1886,  The Coca‑Cola Company markets more than 2600 beverage products and operates in more than 200 countries.  This includes sparkling and still beverages,  such as waters,  juices and juice drinks,  teas,  coffeessports drinks and energy drinks.  Four of the top five sparkling beverage brands are ours: Coca‑Cola,  Diet Coke,  Sprite and Fanta.  
One of our greatest strengths is our ability to conduct business on a worldwide scale while maintaining a local approach.  At the heart of this approach is the Coca‑Cola bottling system.  The Coca‑Cola system comprises our Company and our bottling partners — more than 300 worldwide.  
The Coca‑Cola Company is headquartered in Atlanta,  Georgia,  and is structured across seven operating groups,  in addition to Corporate.  At the end of 2006,  our Company had approximately 71000 associates,  and as of January 2007,  our operating structure consisted of Africa; Eurasia; European Union; Latin America; North America; Pacific; and Bottling Investments.  For more details on our operating groups,  see pages 28–39.  
Many consumers do not realize this,  but there is a distinction between our Company and our bottling partners.  Our Company manufactures and sells concentrates,  beverage bases and syrups to bottling operations,  which then produce a wide array of Coca‑Cola beverages.  Our Company owns the brands and is responsible for consumer brand marketing initiatives.  Our bottling partners,  in addition to manufacturing the final branded beverages,  also handle merchandising and distribution.

Bottlers work closely with customers — grocery stores,  restaurants,  street vendors,  convenience stores,  movie theaters and amusement parksamong many others — to execute localized strategies developed in partnership with the Company.  Customers then sell our products to consumers at a rate of 14 billion servings a day.  The Coca‑Cola system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective,  and the Company does not own or control most of our bottlers.  In 2006,  bottling partners in which our Company had no ownership interest or a noncontrolling equity interest produced and distributed approximately 83 percent of our worldwide unit case volume (see pie chart,  right).  In January 2006,  our Companyowned bottling operations were brought together to form the Bottling Investments operating groupnow the second-largest bottler in the Coca-Cola system in terms of unit case volume.

The mark we leave will have an impact for generations to come,  so it is critical to work with others to find viable solutions to global,  social and economic challenges.  Meaningful change on a global scale requires collaboration and mutual commitment.  Togetherthe small steps we take will lead to something bigger.  We are working with our bottling partnerssuppliers,  other businesses,  governments,  NGOs and community leaders to develop and implement 16	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
innovative solutions to global challenges.  Solutions to these complex issues — clean water access and availability,  climate change,  raw material scarcity and the spread of infectious diseases — will positively impact communities as well as the sustainable growth of our business.  We have an obligation to conduct our business ethically and responsibly and to contribute to the well-being of the people our business touches.  This starts with the men and women of The Coca‑Cola Company.  We have a responsibility 
to provide a safe,  inclusive work environment where our associates are valued and fulfilled.  Our commitment to the safety and quality of our beverages is of the highest importance to us.  We never forget that we are invited into people is lives 14 billion times each day through our beverages.  We also have an obligation to ensure our consumers can make well‑informed beverage choices.  We increasingly provide more nutrition information on our packaging.  And we encourage 
and support well‑being and active lifestyles around the world.  Additionally,  we work to protect and preserve the environment through our water stewardship,  sustainable packagingand energy and climate protection initiatives.  We believe the public and private sectors can and should contribute to improving the shape of our world.  Individuals also play a vital role in improving the economic,  social and environmental condition of our planet.  Working together,  we can make a meaningful difference.

Workplace Rights 
Our Workplace Rights Policy and Human Rights Statement reflect international human rights principles that promote and protect human rights in the workplace.  In January 2007,  we released our Workplace Rights Policy (the 'Policy") and Human Rights Statement as part of our commitment to uphold the United Nations Global Compact principles.  These documents are guided by international human rights standards,  including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization is Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  We are actively implementing our Policy worldwide,  including training senior managers in Human Resources,  Legal,  Public Affairs and Communications,  and Security on the Policy.  All associates are briefed on the Policy,  and our intention is that by the end of 2007,  all Company manufacturing facilities will have been assessed by third parties to ensure compliance.  Toll-free telephone numbers and email contacts are posted at each of our facilities worldwide.  18	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
Associates are encouraged to report violations of the Policy and are assured that they will be protected from any reprisal or retaliatory action.  We are committed to investigating and addressing the concerns of our associates and to taking appropriate corrective action.  While the Workplace Rights Policy applies to The Coca‑Cola Company and all of the entities that we own or hold a majority interest in,  we are committed to working with and encouraging our independent bottling partners to uphold the values and practices that our Policy encompasses.  As part of protecting the rights of our associateswe work with our bottling partners to address HIV/AIDS.  Since 2002,  the Coca‑Cola system in Africa has provided comprehensive HIV/AIDS health care coverage for approximately 60000 Coca‑Cola system associates in Africa,  as well as their spouses and children.  In 2006,  we met with many of our bottling partners in Africa to undertake a major review of our progress to date and to identifyand share best practices and future challenges.  HIV/AIDS workplace programs have been extended to China,  India and Russia.  
Engaging on Human Rights 
We respect the human rights principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and strive to ensure that human rights are respected by our business partners.  As part of our UN Global Compact commitmentwe have pledged to respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and to ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses.  Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) are a vital pillar of our Company is efforts to ensure that our business partners respect labor rights.  Our SGP emphasize the importance of responsible workplace policies and practices that complyat a minimum,  with applicable environmental laws and with local labor laws and regulations.  In 2007,  we updated and relaunched our SGP through a series of communications,  toolkits and training materials.  The updated SGP broaden the criteria against which suppliers are assessed and focus on workplace rights in the supply chain.  We expanded our SGP global team into new regionsadding full-time staff in Eurasia and Africa.  
We have also taken steps to address human rights in the communities in which we operate,  with a focus on zones of conflict.  In 2006,  we partnered with the UN Global Compact,  the International Business Leaders Forum and Fundación Ideas para la Paz (Ideas for Peace Foundation) on a series of conferences on development,  peace and human rights in Colombia.  The conferences brought together experts from the public,  private and civil society sectors in Bogotá,  London and Washington,  D. C.,  to discuss these complex issues.  As a result,  our system has joined other multinational companies operating in Colombia in developing and adopting a set of voluntary principles on human rights and security.  In 2005,  The Coca‑Cola Company committed to donate $10 million to help establish the Fundación Colombia para la Educación y la Oportunidad (Colombian Foundation for Education and Opportunity),  which promotes education and employment opportunities in Colombian communities that have suffered from violence.  To date,  the foundation is programs have reached 20000 people across Colombia.

Product Quality 
We have a single set of global quality standards and an uncompromising commitment to product safety and quality.  
Assurance (LRQA).  SGS-ICS and LRQA found that TCCQS — Evolution 3 meets the requirements of all three standards.  
Product quality issues or allegations of product contamination,  even when false or unfoundedcould tarnish the image of affected brands and the Coca‑Cola business.  
The Coca-Cola Company has stringent global standards for all of the ingredients used in its beverages.  Through TCCQS,  441 different tests are carried out routinely by bottling operations and external laboratories to ensure the safety and quality of our beverages.  
Our quality management system,  The Coca-Cola Quality System (TCCQS) — Evolution 3,  coordinates and guides our activities to ensure quality in everything we do.  Everyone who works for or with the Company is empowered and expected to maintain the highest standards of quality in products,  processes and relationships.  The third evolution of TCCQS has been benchmarked against internationally recognized requirements for quality (ISO 9001:2000)environmental (ISO 14001:2004) and occupational health and safety (OHSAS 18001:1999) standards by the Société Générale de Surveillance‑International Certification Services (SGS-ICS) and Lloyd is Register Quality 
20	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
Our processes undergo constant scrutiny to safeguard the water we use in our products and the packaging that carries them to our consumers.  Additionally,  we inform and educate our suppliers about our standards so that they meet the highest quality requirements,  and audits are performed to ensure compliance.  In the event that a product quality issue is reportedthe Coca‑Cola system is Incident Management and Crisis Resolution (IMCR) program responds quickly and effectively.  The IMCR program is integrated and aligned throughout the Coca‑Cola systemwith our bottling partners playing a key role.  
Well-being and Choice 
We are committed to offering our consumers a broad and balanced portfolio of beverages to meet their tastes and needs.  Well-being is an increasingly important issue for consumers and our business.  Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity contribute to health problems.  The consequences associated with obesity and other health-related conditionsparticularly among young people,  are a growing concern for our stakeholders.  Our Company continues to expand our beverage portfolio,  as well as packaging options and sizesin order to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences.  We offer more than 2600 sparkling and still beverage products,  including juices and juice drinks,  sports drinks,  energy drinks,  teascoffees and water.  The Coca-Cola system is voluntarily expanding nutrition labeling so that consumers can make informed dietary choices.  In the United States,  new packaging will include caffeine content in addition to the other detailed nutrition information already on packaging.  In 2006,  Coca‑Cola Australia began providing caloric information per serving on labels 
based on consultation with stakeholders and consumer groups.  And by 2008,  all Coca‑Cola products in the European Union will have expanded nutrition labeling based on Guideline Daily Amounts,  in an initiative supported by other industry leaders and stakeholders.  We understand that parents want to be the gatekeepers for their children is consumption.  Our global policy prohibits marketing full-sugar beverages on television programs primarily viewed by children.  Our system in the United States uses the new School Beverage Guidelines developed by the American Beverage Association and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation,  a joint initiative of the William J.  Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association.  And throughout Europe,  our system has implemented independently monitored commitments regarding advertising to children and the sale of beverages in schools.  Our Company is Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness is engaged in nutrition research and education.  The website,  www, beverageinstitute, orgis now available in Chinese,  Portuguese and Spanish,  in addition to English.

Active Lifestyles 
Our Company has long been associated with sports — from sponsorship of competitions such as the Olympic Games to grassroots sports and physical activity programs.  We understand our stakeholders are increasingly concerned about health and obesity,  particularly for young people.  We provide access to a wide range of youth development and educational programs with an emphasis on physical activity and nutrition education.  GreatFun2Run is an example of a collaborative initiative our system launched in the United Kingdom,  together with Nova International and the Institute of Youth Sport at Loughborough University.  Teachers and parents were involved in a research study designed to scientifically evaluate a curriculum-based physical activity and healthy eating program for 600 English primary schoolchildren.  Study results showed that the program was highly successful in increasing physical activity and in slowing the rate of increase in body mass index and waist circumference.  22	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
Four of our largest active lifestyle programs have benefited approximately 6 million children: 	 Coca-Cola School Cup,  a collaborative event with the Ministry of Education and Football Federation of Kazakhstan,  engaged nearly 1 million students from over 5000 schools and was recognized by FIFA™ as the 'Most Valuable Grassroots Football Event of 2006. " 	 Copa Coca‑Cola,  a soccer tournament for teenagers that originated in Mexico in 1998,  has spread to other countries,  reaching more than 600000 students in 10000 schools and/or youth clubs in Africa,  the Americas,  Asia and Europe.  	 Live It! helped more than 3 million middle school students in North America get active and better educated about nutrition during the 2006–2007 school year.  	 Thai Kids on the Move educates students on the importance of nutrition and motivates them to get active.  The program was established in 2004 and is expected to reach more than 1 million children by the end of 2007.  
Water Stewardship 
Mekong River 
East Africa

Yangtze River 
We have pledged to replace every drop of water we use in our beverages and their production.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world,  facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation,  increasing pollution and poor management.  More than 1 billion people do not have access to clean,  safe drinking water.  And more than 26 billion people do not have basic sanitation.  Water is the main ingredient in every beverage we make.  Because of the critical importance of water to our business,  and to ecosystems,  human health,  progress and development,  our Company is focusing on conserving and protecting water for people,  species and ecosystems throughout the world.  Our water stewardship goals focus on three components: reduce,  recycle and replenish.  First,  we will set specific water efficiency targets for our global operations by 2008.  
Danube River 
Rio Grande/Rio Bravo 
Southeastern U.S.  Rivers and Streams 
Second,  we are working to return the water that we use for manufacturing processes to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life by the end of 2010.  Third,  are working to replenish water by supporting healthy watersheds and sustainable community water programs to balance the water used in our finished beverages.  We have announced an expansion of our work with WWF to achieve meaningful and large-scale results through a five-year effort to conserve and protect freshwater resources (see photos of targeted areas above),  supported by a $20 million grant from our Company.  The Coca‑Cola system is already implementing a variety of water projects around the world.  We have established 68 community-based water initiatives in 40 countries.  These projects include locally relevant initiatives focused on water supply,  sanitation,  hygiene,  watershed management,  productive water use,  and education and awareness.

technologies.  HFCs are gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect.  
Greenhouse gas emissions are a crucial factor in global climate change.  The implications of climate change for our planet are profound and wideranging,  with expected effects on biodiversitywater resources,  public health and agriculture.  
We are now implementing these technologies.  On World Environment Day,  June 5,  2006,  we announced that we had achieved the conversion to HFC-free insulation for more than 1300 models of cold-drink equipment,  representing over 98 percent of the new equipment we purchase.  
Climate change may have long-term direct and indirect implications for the Coca‑Cola system and our supply chain.  Through continuous improvement in our operations,  our system has improved the energy efficiency of our manufacturing operations by 16 percent since 2002,  the year we began reporting our performance.  Our system is primary energy and climate impact is due to vending machines and coolers,  which produce three times the estimated emissions of our manufacturing plants.  Therefore we focus much of our energy-efficiency efforts on sustainable refrigeration.  In 2000,  we launched eKOfreshment to develop commercially viable hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free refrigeration 
24	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
We have also been investing in HFC-free refrigeration equipment.  By the end of 2006,  we placed 6000 units with CO2 refrigeration in the market,  including 2000 at the FIFA World Cup™ in Germany,  earning us a Cooling Industry Award.  Our proprietary Energy Management System (EMS),  EMS-55,  can reduce energy consumption by up to 35 percent.  By mid-2007,  more than half a million of these EMS-55 units were purchased by the Coca‑Cola system,  representing an estimated annual energy reduction of more than 640 million kilowatt-hours and a corresponding reduction of more than 300000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

Sustainable Packaging 
We envision a world in which our packaging is seen as a valuable resource for future use.  
advance sustainable collection systems that realize this economic value.  
Our sustainable packaging strategy is focused on package design,  community recovery programs and package material reuse.  Our system focuses on reducing both waste and the consumption of natural resources.  
We believe education is key to changing attitudes and behaviors about recycling and litter prevention.  We support numerous litter prevention organizations,  including Keep America Beautiful — a network of more than 1000 local stewardship organizations — and The Ocean Conservancy is International Coastal Cleanup,  the world is largest volunteer cleanup on behalf of the marine environment.  
We are advancing sustainable design efforts through an initiative known as e3,  which focuses on improving efficiency,  life-cycle effectiveness and eco-innovation.  For example,  using state-ofthe-art computer design software,  we have effectively reduced the weight and improved the impact resistance of our most recognizable package — the glass contour bottle.  This new 'Ultra" bottle saved 89000 metric tons of glass in 2006,  the CO2 equivalent of planting more than 13000 acres of trees.  Recycling rates for beverage containers are among the highest of any consumer product packaging in the world.  We are focused on designing packages with high end-use value and helping communities 
Our life-cycle management has helped us to sustain the use of high-value recyclable materials and reusable packages.  Approximately 85 percent of our global unit case volume is delivered in 100 percent recyclable materials: PET,  plasticaluminum,  glass and steel.  The remaining 15 percent is largely delivered through highly efficient bulk package systems.  We also have invested in building PET recycling plants that produce bottles from recycled content in Australia,  Austria,  Mexico,  the Philippines and Switzerland.

Colombia and India Updates Violent conflict in Colombia and product quality and environmental challenges in India continue to be issues our stakeholders want to better understand.  Colombia A lawsuit alleging anti-union activity by Coca‑Cola bottlers in Colombia was dismissed by the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida in September 2006.  In the dismissal,  the Court concluded that 'Plaintiffs' allegations fail to plead facts that sufficiently demonstrate the necessary relationship between the Defendants and the paramilitaries…" Previously,  two different judicial inquiries in Colombia — one in a Colombian court,  and one by the Colombian attorney general is office — also found no evidence to support the claim that Coca‑Cola bottler management conspired with paramilitaries to threaten or intimidate Colombian trade unionists.  We believe that any additional investigations or evaluations of our system is labor relations and workers' rights practices in Colombia would likewise confirm that workers in Coca‑Cola plants enjoy freedom of association,  collective bargaining rights and a work atmosphere free of anti-union intimidation. * India We adhere to the same high standards for both product quality and environmental stewardship in India as we do in all other countries.  India faces serious water problems.  The country is extremely dependent on seasonal rains,  and rainwater storage is a major challenge.  Over the last few years,  we have made significant improvements in water conservation.  From 1999 
26	 The Coca‑Cola Company 
to 2006,  we have reduced water consumption in our operations in India by 35 percent.  We have also helped install more than 300 rainwater harvesting systems across 17 states.  The collected water is used for recharging aquifers.  Today,  more than a third of the total water we use in our operations in India is renewed and returned to groundwater systems,  and we are working toward returning all the water we use in our operations.  We use state-of-the-art technologies to ensure that our beverages are of the highest quality.  Our beverages in India have been analyzed by government and independent laboratories with results consistently showing that they are produced to the same level of purity,  regarding pesticides,  as the European Union criteria for drinking water — globally accepted as one of the most stringent standards in the world.  We support development of science-based standards for soft drinks regarding pesticide residue based on internationally accepted and validated testing protocols.  And we are working with the relevant government bodies to establish these criteria and testing protocols.  In support of this effort,  we are participating in a project with AOAC International (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) to help the Indian government develop appropriate pesticide standards.  The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI),  a well-respected NGO based in India,  has agreed to conduct an independent assessment of our water resource management practices in Indiaincluding potential pesticide contamination of intake water.  We have pledged full cooperation with TERI in completing this assessment and addressing its findings.

Environmental Statement A healthy environment,  locally and globally,  is vital to our business and to the communities where we operate.  We view protection of the environment as a journey,  not a destination.  We began that journey over 100 years ago and it continues today.  Each associate of The Coca‑Cola Company has responsibility for stewardship of our natural resources and must strive to conduct business in ways that protect and preserve the environment.

Doing so not only benefits the environment,  it makes good business sense.
