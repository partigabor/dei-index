 Letter from our CHAIRMAN and Chief Executive Officer 
dear stakeholders: 
The economic,  environmental and social implications of business are more important than ever.  In a world where populations are growingnatural resources are stressed,  communities are forced to do more with less and our consumers' expectations are expanding,  we understand that sustainability is core to our business continuity and how we create long-term value.  This report is a reflection of the efforts being made today by the dedicated men and women of The Coca‑Cola Company and our bottling partners around the world.  Indeed,  it is our bottling partners who are responsible for implementing so many of our shared plans.  Without their contribution,  advancing this important work would not be possible.  The foundation of this work is a systemwide sustainability framework called LIVE POSITIVELY,  built on our commitment to making a positive difference in the world.  LIVE POSITIVELY is embedded within our entire business at every level.  We launched LIVE POSITIVELY three years ago with the understanding that we would focus our energy and efforts in the areas where our business has the opportunity to make the greatest contribution to communities worldwide and create value for our Company.  So,  we reevaluated our programs and we narrowed our focus.  In the environmental space,  we focus on water,  recycling and managing our carbon emissions.  In the active healthy living arena,  we focus on physical activity and nutrition education and providing a variety of quality beverages to consumers.  In the workplace,  we focus on protecting human rightscreating safe,  healthy workplaces for our associates,  ethically sourcing materials in our supply chain and championing diversity.  And,  in building sustainable communities,  we focus on supporting economic opportunity and empowerment.  We have defined principles and set aggressive goals for each focus area,  and we are committed to sharing our plans,  success stories and opportunities for improvement.  LIVE POSITIVELY also is an integral component of our 2020 Vision—our roadmap for winning together with our bottling partners—and is a part of our business planning process.  The only way we will meet the goals and growth targets outlined in our 2020 Vision is by creating and maintaining a sustainable business.  We recognize the need to create innovative new products,  packaging and systems; strengthen the world is most advanced supply chain; enhance our presence in communities and manage our impact on the world is natural resources.  We also need to manage the issues we face,  including the growing concerns over obesity,  and continue to take a leadership role in developing programs and partnerships that are part of the solution.  That is what sustainability is all about— ensuring we are here today,  tomorrow and for another 125 years.  
The Coca-Cola Company 
In Churchill,  Manitoba,  Canada—the polar bear capital of the world—Muhtar traveled with our global conservation partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  learning about the impacts of climate change.  We are working with WWF on projects around the world to further our environmental understanding and progress.  
Two examples of our sustainability advancement are our new PlantBottle™ packaging and our '5 by 20" initiative.  We launched PlantBottle packaging in certain markets with Coca‑Cola® and Dasani® brands in 2009,  and we made the commitment to expand our use of the innovation to more than 2 billion bottles this year.  The technology reduces our use of petroleum-based materials in our PET packaging by up to 30 percent and is the first PET plastic beverage bottle made from renewable resources that can be recycled in the existing recycling infrastructure.  We will continue to invest in PlantBottle packaging and introduce it to new markets and beverages in the coming years.  We announced '5 by 20" in September 2010.  '5 by 20" is our commitment to empower 5 million women inside and outside the Coca‑Cola system by 2020,  and support their growth,  innovationeducation and prosperity.  I am confident this initiative will strengthen economic opportunities for women in the communities we serve and help us grow our business in markets around the world.  I am personally championing this initiative.  We have always linked the success of our business to the strength of the communities in which we operate.  If they aren't thriving,  there is a strong likelihood that our business will suffer.  The decisions we make are related to building more sustainable communities and earning our social license to operate— an intrinsic value of sustainability.  I see maintaining our social license to operate as a responsibility of every associate in the Coca‑Cola system,  and it starts with me.  As much as my title is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  it is equally as much CSO—Chief Sustainability Officer.  And it is a responsibility I am keenly aware of and am stewarding every day.  In the pages of this report you will see our sustainability strategy,  goalsprogress and areas for improvement.  You also will learn about some of our key partnerships and the rationale for what we do and why we do it.  We are todayand always will be,  a company committed to making a positive difference in the world,  and we are working every day to deliver on this commitment.  Very truly yours Muhtar Kent Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer December 2010

LIVE POSITIVELY and REPORTING PARAMETERS 
What is LIVE POSITIVELY? LIVE POSITIVELY is our systemwide sustainability framework.  It is created on the foundation of our commitment to making a positive difference in the worldand it is embedded within our entire business at every level.  The LIVE POSITIVELY framework consists of seven core areas key to our business sustainability: Beverage Benefits; Active Healthy Living; Community; Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection; Sustainable Packaging; Water Stewardship; and Workplace.  The Coca‑Cola system has defined principles for each of the core areas and has set aggressive goals for each.  In addition to these goals,  some of our bottling partners have set their own goals in the core areas and report on their individual business progress in their sustainability reports (see page 45).  We created LIVE POSITIVELY in 2007 to bring structure and visibility to the sustainability programs that already existed in our Company and the Coca‑Cola system,  as well as to form a program that associates can engage with and use to further understand our sustainability commitment.  LIVE POSITIVELY provides a framework to help us redesign the way we work and live,  so that we consider sustainability as part of everything we do.  It is a way for us to holistically think about sustainability and keep us focused on driving business growth while acting with future generations in mind.  Learn more at www, sustainability, thecoca‑colacompany, com.  
Scope of Report This 2009/2010 Sustainability Review covers the performance of The Coca‑Cola Company and the Coca‑Cola system (our Company and our more than 300 bottling partners worldwide) from August 2009 through September 2010.  In cases where information is tracked by calendar year,  the data reflects 2009 and prior calendar year performanceas applicable.  All data and information in this report reflects the performance and goals of the Coca‑Cola system,  unless otherwise indicated.  This report is organized by the seven core areas of LIVE POSITIVELY.  The information reported in each of these core areas is based on the ongoing feedback we receive from internal and external stakeholders.  We also structure our reporting on the principles outlined in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines,  United Nations (UN) Global Compact (signatory since 2006) and CEO Water Mandate (signatory since 2007).  An index of the report content relevant to these principles is on pages 42–43.  We have included an extensive discussion of potential risks and challenges to our business in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10‑K,  pages 12–19,  and other filings with the United States (U.S. ) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  We discuss some of these issues and include others of interest to our stakeholders in this reportsuch as responsible water use,  energy efficiency and climate protection,  sustainable packaging,  obesity and other health concerns,  workplace and human rights,  associate health and safety,  anti‑corruption and product quality.  4

Goals and Measurement Our sustainability reporting is evolving.  Each year we work to provide a more robust and informative report to our stakeholders.  We also work to employ improved metrics and goal setting. 1 While we discuss initiatives and programs,  as well as progress from year to year,  we recognize the need to report additional quantifiable metrics and targets.  A summary of our sustainability goals and our performance against our current metrics can be found on pages I–IV.  
Transparency We believe commitment is meaningless without accountability.  The scrutiny we face from a global audience is high,  and the need for increased transparency continues to grow beyond the requests of our critics to those of our customers,  partners and consumers.  We value an open and honest dialogue with our stakeholders,  and we are continually advancing the information we share with our stakeholders.  In this report,  you will see global targets for each of the core areas of LIVE POSITIVELY as well as progress reports against goals that we have disclosed in previous years.  We also have expanded the parameters for which we are disclosing data publicly and in this report.  
Third-Party Assurance The content of this report has been assured through a rigorous internal verification process,  which included verifying qualitative and quantitative claims and data.  We also had all facts,  data,  claims and corresponding text in this report independently verified to a limited level of assurance by FIRA Sustainability.  Their assurance statement,  which includes a description of the work undertaken,  is on page 41.  
Listening to our Stakeholders Our contribution to sustainable development and the benefits to our business can be greatly magnified when we work together with our bottling partners,  customers and other stakeholders.  Since publishing our most recent Sustainability Review in November 2009,  we have received feedback from internal and external stakeholders on what content should be added to or expanded in this year is report.  These stakeholders include shareowners,  associates,  bottling partners,  suppliers,  government partners,  students,  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),  customers and consumers.  We have used their feedback to help shape this report,  including our level of transparency,  and the variety of topics and issues we address.  We also receive feedback from stakeholders by email.  This is a valuable tool for us to understand your thoughts and concerns.  We invite you to send your commentssuggestions and critiques on our sustainability practices as well as the content of this report to sustainability[at]na, ko, com.

Quenching Consumers' Thirst Consumers are increasingly making purchase decisions based on their concerns for the health and well-being of their families.  These decisions drive us to innovate to meet those evolving needs,  while at the same time providing consumers with great taste,  refreshment and hydration.  We are constantly working to innovate and offer consumers a beverage for every lifestyle and occasion.  Our portfolio comprises a wide range of full-,  reduced-low- and no-calorie sparkling and still beverages,  including juices and juice drinkswaters,  sports and energy drinks,  teas,  coffees,  and dairy- and soy-based beverages.  And we continue to build our portfolio of vitamin- and nutrient-enhanced beverages.  Our portfolio has more than 3300 beverages—three times the number we offered 10 years ago.  Of these,  more than 800 are low- and no-calorie beverages,  which make up nearly 25 percent of our global unit case volume.  
Meeting Needs with Fortified Beverages We continue to increase the number of fortified beverages we offer and have a variety of products with added vitaminsminerals and other beneficial ingredients to meet consumer needs around the world.  
Minute Maid® Pulpy Super Milky™ is a dairy beverage fortified with fruit bits and whey protein in China.

Innovating to Foster Active Healthy Living We are committed to investing in innovation of sweeteners,  products,  packagingequipment and marketing that fosters active healthy living.  Every day we work to keep up with the pace of the changing world—meeting the hydration needs of consumers today while anticipating their needs for tomorrow.  Today is consumers want informationand they want choice in the beverages they purchase.  In an effort to meet consumers' evolving needs,  we study trends,  survey consumersassess individual markets,  share best practices across the Coca‑Cola system,  search for new ingredients and package options,  and then we innovate accordingly.  Whether it is a low-calorie option of a favorite beverage or an entirely new category,  we are committed to providing a variety of products to our consumers,  and we seek to gain new consumers with our diverse portfolio.  In 2009,  our innovation led to more than 600 new product launches globally,  including more than 180 low- and no-calorie beverages.  We also introduced several portioncontrolled options of our full-calorie beverages.  
We continue to expand the availability of Coca‑Cola Zero® to new marketsincluding Afghanistan,  GuyanaSaint Lucia and Zimbabwe,  for a total of more than 130 markets as of September 2010.

Hydration Education Water is the principal ingredient or component in nearly all of our beverages.  Each of our beverages provides necessary hydration to consumers.  We try to help consumers manage their health and hydration needs so they can make informed decisions.  One tool we offer is a hydration calculator,  which is available on our Company website.  The calculator explains the approximate amount of fluid a consumer needs to drink each day to stay hydrated based on age,  weight,  gender,  activity level and other information about his or her environment.  We invite you to interact with the tool at www, hydration, thecoca‑colacompany, com.

Product Safety and Quality Consumers Can Trust Ensuring the safety and quality of our products has always been at the core of our business and is directly linked to the success of our Company.  Our safety and quality programs and protocols focus on the ingredients and materials we use to create and package our products.  They also regulate the manufacturing,  bottling and distribution of our products.  As we expand our beverage portfolio and supplier base to meet the increasing demands of growing and developing markets around the world,  customer and consumer expectations and regulatory scrutiny continue to rise.  Each of these factors makes ensuring product safety and quality more complex and more critical to our continued success.  In January 2010,  we launched the Coca‑Cola Operating Requirements System (KORE)a new management system that enables the Coca‑Cola system to collectively address the changing business landscape while supporting our Company is strategic growth plans.  KORE outlines clear requirements for the policies,  specifications and programs that guide our operations for product quality,  occupational safety and health,  and environmental standards across the entire Coca‑Cola system.  KORE also establishes a governance process and monitors compliance to ensure the integrity of our products.  Lastly,  KORE helps manage risk in our Company,  bottling operations and across our supply chain.  KORE replaced The Coca‑Cola Management System (referred to as 'TCCMS" in previous reports).  
Managing Risk We are constantly working to manage risks at The Coca‑Cola Company.  We view risk management as an invaluable tool to manage our business risks and opportunities.  Our Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee— comprised of a cross-functional group of senior managers— oversees risk management activities across the Company.  We ensure key risks are identified and acceptable mitigation plans are in place,  and we update our Board of Directors on our risk management strategy.  In addition to Enterprise Risk Managementwe have programs in place for Incident Management and Crisis Resolution,  Business Continuity Planning,  Emergency Planning and Disaster Recovery.  Risks that could materially affect our business are outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,  which is filed with the U.S.  SEC and is available on our Company website.  
'Quality assurance is a top priority across the Coca‑Cola system.  Consumers trust that every time they open one of our products it is safe to drink and of the highest quality.  At Coca‑Cola,  we define product safety and quality as 'the perfect product trusted everywhere. '" Carletta Ooton Chief Quality & Product Integrity OfficerThe Coca‑Cola Company

Communicating Sweetener Safety Consumer demand for great-tasting beverages with low- or no-calorie options continues to grow.  Low- and no-calorie sweeteners provide consumers with beverage options without compromising flavor or taste.  Sweet tastes usually come from one of two types of sweeteners: caloric sweeteners,  like sugar which provides 16 calories per teaspoon,  and low- and no-calorie sweeteners,  which provide few or no calories.  We continue to invest in research around sweeteners and work to educate consumers on the sweeteners we use in our beverages.  Our sweetener strategy is to choose the best sweetener for our beverages without compromising taste or quality while also meeting regulatory requirements for a given market.  All of the sweeteners used in our products meet strict regulatory standards and are deemed safe by national governments in the countries in which we sell them.  
Caloric Sweeteners Table sugar,  or sucrose,  is made from sugar cane or sugar beets.  It is a carbohydrate and provides 4 calories (17 kilojoules) per gram.  The amount of sugar and calories in sparkling beverages is about the same as the amount found in many fruit juices. 1 High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener made from corn.  It is used to sweeten many foods and beverages sold in the United States and other countries.  It has the same number of calories as and is nutritionally equivalent to sugar.  Low- and No-Calorie Sweeteners	 Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K or acesulfame K) is a no-calorie sweetener that is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar.  Thousands of food and beverage products sweetened with acesulfame K can be found in approximately 90 countries,  including AustraliaCanada,  most of Europe,  Japan and the United States.  Aspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched food ingredients in use today.  It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar and used in more than 6000 products around the world.  In addition to approval from the European Food 1	 
Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  regulatory agencies in more than 100 countries have approved aspartame for use in foods and beverages.  
Stevia extract—the best-tasting part of the leaf of the stevia plant— is about 200 times sweeter than sugar.  Truvia™ is the brand name for stevia extract used in our beverages.  Stevia extract is safety has been established by more than 25 years of scientific research and the publication of safety studies from a rigorous,  comprehensive scientific research program commissioned by The Coca‑Cola Company and Cargill.  Stevia extract achieved Generally Recognized As Safe status in the United States in December 2008 and also has been approved as safe by EFSA and the FAO-WHO JECFA.  We have more than 20 beverages in five countries sweetened with stevia extract in combination with other natural sweeteners like fruit juicesugar,  honey and other natural low- and no-calorie sweeteners.  
Cyclamate is a low-calorie sweetener approximately 30 times sweeter than sugar.  Although the FDA withdrew its approval of cyclamate in 1969,  since then,  more than 75 scientific studies have proven it to be safe for human consumption.  Independent scientists of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization is (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) have consistently affirmed the safety of cyclamate for use as a sweetener in foods and beverages,  as have regulatory agencies in Australia,  Europe and many other countries.  As a resultcyclamate is now permitted for use in more than 50 countries around the world.  
Sucralose is derived from sugar but is nearly 600 times sweeter.  It does not contribute calories to the diet.  It is permitted for use in foods and beverages in more than 40 countries,  including AustraliaCanada,  Mexico and the United States.  Numerous studies have shown,  and the American Diabetes Association has affirmed,  that sucralose can be safely consumed by people with diabetes.

active healthy living 
Our Commitment to Active Healthy Living We are committed to being part of the solution to the obesity-related problems facing society.  We do this by promoting active healthy living programs to our associates and their families as well as the communities that we serve.  While our markets may differ around the world,  consumer well-being is a consistent theme.  We recognize the health of our business is interwoven with the health and well-being of our consumers,  our associates and the communities where we operate.  We are keenly aware that leading an active healthy lifestyle is much more complex than simply being physically active.  So we focus our efforts to enhance health and well-being in three core areas—education,  variety and physical activity—a strategy we refer to as 'THINK,  DRINK,  MOVE. " We activate this strategy by educating associates,  consumers and community members about the importance of energy balance,  the benefits of our beverages and our commitment to transparencyincluding front-of-pack energy labeling; providing consumers a variety of beverage options and package sizes to meet their nutrition and energy needs; and encouraging active healthy living through Coca‑Cola system–supported energy balance programsincluding physical activity and nutrition education.  Our strategy continues to evolve as the world and environment we operate in changesand we continue to refine and bring clarity to our role in promoting active healthy living.  
Encouraging Active Healthy Lifestyles in 137 Countries In March 2010,  we recognized the World Health Organization is World Health Day with a comprehensive program in 137 countries.  The program encouraged associates,  consumers and community members to adopt active healthy lifestyles through Company-sponsored bicycle rides and walks; education sessions with nutritionists and fitness trainers; and healthier menu choices in our facilities.  
'My patients often forget that beverages play a very important role in managing body weight.  Lower- and no-calorie beverages are a good way to conveniently lower calorie intake without feeling deprived.  A balanced diet,  including portion control and beverage awareness,  and exercise are the best ways to help you keep a healthy body and healthy weight. " Dr.  John Foreyt,  Director,  Behavioral Medicine Research Center,  Baylor College of Medicine

From 1999 through 2009,  our average calories per serving decreased by 10% globally.  In Mexico,  we have sponsored Copa Coca‑Cola for more than a decade.  In 2010,  the soccer program had approximately 80000 youth participants.  Globally,  our physical activity programs have reached millions of people.  Working with Partners to Drive Results We continue to build public-private partnerships to promote the importance of energy balance that includes physical activity and sensible,  balanced diets.  In the United States,  we currently reach millions of consumers annually through our work with the American Dietetic Association; the National Heart,  Lung,  and Blood Institute is The Heart Truth® campaign; the American Cancer Society is Choose You™ campaign; the American College of Sports Medicine; the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association; and the American Academy of Family Physicians.  
Energy Balance and Product Options We understand the gravity of the global obesity epidemic,  and we believe all stakeholders—individuals,  communities,  businesses and governments—need to play a role in addressing it.  The Coca‑Cola system is committed to helping address obesity through all aspects of our business,  from our products and packaging to the programs we support and the policies we put in place to guide our operations.  We are actively partnering with government,  academia,  health societies and other responsible members of civil society to help develop workable solutions to address obesity.  There is widespread consensus that weight gain is primarily the result of an imbalance of energy—too many calories consumed versus calories expended.  Since people consume many different foods and beverages,  no single food or beverage is responsible for people being overweight or obese.  But all calories count,  whatever food or beverage they come from,  including those from our caloric beverages.  We are committed to providing a variety of products for every lifestyle and occasion.  All of our products can be part of an active healthy lifestyle that includes a sensiblebalanced diet and regular physical activity.  
coca‑cola sponsored Physical activity AND NUTRITION EDUCATION programs We sponsor approximately 150 physical activity and nutrition education programs in nearly 100 countries around the world and are committed to having at least one program in every country where we operate by the end of 2015.  
In Greece,  we work with our bottling partner,  Coca‑Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S. A.  (Coca-Cola Hellenic)relevant NGOs,  and nutrition and physical activity experts to bring an annual,  unbranded,  32-hour health and wellness education program to students at primary schools nationwide under the auspices of the Ministry of Health.  In the Philippines,  we partner with the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology,  and the Department of Education to offer KinetiKids,  an unbranded nutrition education and physical activity program that includes 30-minute daily workouts in primary schools.  
Healthy Weight Commitment FOUNDATION In support of First Lady Michelle Obama is Let is Move! initiative,  we joined a coalition of food and beverage manufacturers that pledged to cut 15 trillion calories from our combined product portfolios in the U.S.  by the end of 2015.  We plan to pursue this goal in two ways: continue to offer,  develop and introduce lower-calorie options,  and offer reduced portion sizes of existing single-serve products.  The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation also will promote ways to help Americans achieve and maintain a healthy weight by balancing the energy they consume with the energy they expend through physical activity—in schools and in the workplace.

Providing Extensive Nutrition Education Consumers are more health conscious than ever,  and they are paying more attention to the nutritional value of the foods and beverages they consume.  We have a responsibility to provide consumers access to ingredient and nutrition information for our products so they can make informed choices for themselves and their families.  We take this responsibility very seriously,  and we continue to support fact-based nutrition labeling and education as well as initiatives that encourage people to lead active healthy lifestyles.  We use evidence-based science to support our ingredient and product claims and work to empower consumers with knowledge and education about our products and their ingredients.  In addition to providing basic nutrition information on our products,  we made a global commitment—a beverage industry first—to provide front-of-package calorie/ kilocalorie/kilojoule information (per serving) on nearly all of our products by the end of 2011.  Where allowed by applicable regulations,  percent Daily Guidance Indicators (DGIs)—which place the quantities of select nutrients in the context of population-based dietary guidance—also will be placed on our product packaging.  We are on track to meet this commitment.  
Leading the Industry in Nutrition Labeling AND INFORMATION In February 2010,  Coca‑Cola North America joined the U.S.  beverage industry in making a 'Clear on Calories" commitment in support of First Lady Michelle Obama is Let is Move! initiative.  Clear on Calories is our commitment to place calorie information on the front of our packages and on Company-operated vending machines and beverage fountains.  
Engaging Health Professionals We provide a free,  web-enabled education series to inform health and nutrition professionals on timely health issues; correct misconceptions; balance the debate regarding the role of our products and ingredients in health; and understand their opinions on the topics.  These programs have reached more than 22000 health and nutrition professionals.

In 2011,  the tool will be made available online in multiple languages.  For more informationvisit www, thebeverageinstitute, com.  
Marketing Our Products Responsibly We take our commitment to market responsibly—across the globe,  across all advertising media and across all of our beverages—very seriously.  We have been a leader in the area of responsible marketing,  particularly with regard to responsible marketing practices when children younger than 12 years of age are present.  The Coca‑Cola Company and our bottling partners have had an Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy in place in North America for more than 50 years.  We respect and recognize the role parents and caregivers play in making appropriate choices for their children.  Today we do not directly target children younger than age 12 in our marketing messages or our advertising,  and we do not show children drinking any of our products outside the presence of a parent or caregiver.  Additionally,  we do not directly market in primary schools.  In 2010,  we evolved our global Responsible Marketing Policy and redefined the appropriate audience threshold for children is programming from audiences that are more than 50 percent children younger than 12 years of age to audiences that are more than 35 percent children younger than 12.  This means we will not buy advertising directly targeted at audiences that are more than 35 percent children younger than 12.  Our policy applies to all of our beverages and the media outlets we use,  including television,  radio and print and,  where data is available,  Internet and mobile phones.  In addition,  we are encompassing our Global School Beverage Guidelines within our Responsible Marketing Policy.  
Setting Global School Beverage Guidelines In 2010,  we announced and implemented our Global School Beverage Guidelines.  As a global business,  we recognize and respect the unique learning environment of schools and believe in commercial-free classrooms for children.  Through our guidelines,  we will make every attempt to not commercially advertise or offer our beverages in primary schools,  unless we are requested to do so by a caregiver,  school authority or parent to meet hydration needs.  
In 2009,  independent audit results by a respected third party showed that we have a 97% compliance rate with our Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy.

Developing Economies Through Business and Partnership We pride ourselves on being a local company with global scale.  We operate in hundreds of thousands of cities,  towns and villages in more than 200 countries,  and we employ local people,  source local ingredients,  and produce and sell our products locally.  Operating on a local level supports the communities where we operate by creating jobs,  and it also has the benefit of reducing our carbon footprint.  While the Coca‑Cola system employs approximately 700000 people directly,  we are proud that our supply chain provides employment for millions of people around the world.  Our large global presence is a competitive advantage,  but we also see it as a responsibility.  Our products are purchased by consumers around the world millions of times a day,  making the sustainability of our business dependent upon sustainable economies.  We have always tried to be the first to gain access to a market and to grow along with that market by providing jobs,  investment and economic opportunities.  This in turn provides community members the ability to afford an improved standard of living.  To add further value to local economies,  we seek to ensure that our ingredients are sourced in an ethical,  sustainable manner.

Creating Opportunities for Economic Empowerment We collaborate with our bottling partners and third parties to combine our knowledge and experience to create economic opportunities in communities where we operate.  Our unique business model allows us to support entrepreneurship and economic development at many different levels.  We create opportunities for farmers to supply ingredients for our beverages; we open the door to entrepreneurs wishing to distribute our products; and we partner with the small-scale retailers selling our products in communities worldwide.  We take these steps because they help communities make progress toward achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals,  and they also benefit our business.  
'Mango and passion fruit are plentiful in East Africabut farmers didn't benefit from their sale because reliable markets and buyers didn't exist.  By strengthening farmer groups and collectively leveraging their selling power in local and global markets,  programs like Project Nurture can help small farmers increase their incomes and build better lives. " 
Empowering 5 million Women by 2020 In September 2010 we announced a 10-year global initiative to empower 5 million women through the Coca‑Cola system.  Our Chairman and CEO,  Muhtar Kent,  issued this challenge to our business system and committed to taking the next year to enter into dialogue with our associates,  civil society and governments about how we can best reach this goal in partnership.  This initiative aims to help women in our global business system break down the barriers that can prevent them from growing their businesses.  We anticipate that our efforts will enable these women to reinvest in themselves,  their families and their communities.  Our success rests on the shoulders of millions of women who run small businesses selling and distributing Coca‑Cola products every day.  We aim to reach them with training,  access to financing and links to networks of peers and mentors.  In late 2011,  we will share the details of this initiative and scale up the many pilot programs already under way in the Coca‑Cola system globally.  Learn more at www. 5by20, com.

Micro Distribution Center Progress in Africa Our MDC model in Africa creates jobs,  promotes entrepreneurship and strengthens local economies.  To date,  more than 3000 small distribution businesses have been formed,  creating direct employment for more than 13500 people and generating more than $600 million in revenues.  Our MDCs are located primarily in high-density urban areas throughout East and West Africa,  including Ethiopia,  Kenya,  MozambiqueTanzania and Uganda.  More than 1000 of our MDCs are owned and operated by women.  By the end of 2010,  we will have formed at least 1300 new MDCs since 2008which will have created approximately 6000 new jobs in Africa.  Our business depends on sales and market penetration.  The MDC business model provides a flexible,  local solution to distribution challenges that can prevent our market expansion.  Through our MDC model,  we identify and engage independent entrepreneurs who distribute and sell our beverages in small,  specific geographic areas.  MDCs are typically located in areas where a lack of stable roads and infrastructure makes it difficult for delivery trucks to travel.  Thus,  MDCs help our Company sell our products in hard-to-reach areas while creating wealth and job growth in those communities.  MDC owners employ others in the area,  who then sell and distribute our beverage products to retailers,  often by bicycle,  pushcart or low-cost mechanized transport.  We plan to continue to grow our MDC business model with the goal that 50 percent of all new MDCs will be run by women.  
Micro Distribution Center Owner Rosemary Njeri Rosemary Njeri is one of the leading Coca‑Cola MDC distributors in Nairobi,  Kenya.  She started as a very small Coca‑Cola distributor in the late 1990s,  when she employed two people.  In 1999,  Rosemary was one of the first small distributors given the opportunity to open an MDC in downtown Nairobi.  Through her commitment and dedication,  Rosemary has grown her MDC into a profitable and sustainable business,  employing 16 people.  The proceeds from Rosemary is MDC have enabled her to educate her three children and purchase a home.  
In some markets in Africa,  more than 80% of Coca‑Cola products are distributed through MDCs.

Sustainable Agriculture 
Developing Sustainable Agriculture Programs Our commitment to sustainable community development includes the conservation of natural resources and ecosystems,  and the protection of the soil,  water and climate required to sustain life.  As we consider new ways to make a difference in the communities where we operate,  we recognize that many social,  economic and environmental impacts can occur in our agricultural ingredient supply chain.  Agricultural products are ingredients in almost all of our beverages,  so the health of our business depends on the health of our agricultural supply chain—inclusive of the ecosystems and communities where our suppliers and producers operate.  As a resultwe have adopted a holistic view of our agricultural supply chain.  Working with our suppliers,  we have significant opportunities within our global supply chain to help develop and encourage more sustainable agricultural practices.  Our approach to sustainable agriculture is founded on our belief that workplace rights,  environmental protection and sustainable communities are critical and interconnected.  Our work addresses the environmental impacts,  social implications and economic pressures present in agricultural supply chains.  Our initial efforts are focused on sugar cane and other sugar sources,  corn and oranges.  
Our Company is sustainable agriculture strategy focuses on agricultural ingredients within the Company is supply chain.  Our sustainable agriculture framework seeks to:  Mitigate risks by working with partners and suppliers to address environmental and social challenges to ingredient availability,  quality and safety.   Meet customer and consumer demands for healthy and sustainable lifestyles.   Balance costs and the overall value proposition by leveraging relationships and partnerships as well as initiating new opportunities where they make sense for the supply chain.  
The strategy is built on three elements:  Partner Engagement: Work with key partners to identify and manage supply chain risks and opportunities for improvement.    Fostering Innovation: Initiate pilot projects in key regions to address present and future challenges and create opportunities.   Supply Chain Sustainability Validation: Engage in validation mechanisms,  including certification in some cases,  to verify and validate applicable criteria,  increase our understanding and meet customer requirements.  
PARTNERING FOR A GREATER IMPACT Our global partnership with WWF is a critical part of our sustainable agriculture strategy and focuses on conserving freshwater resources and fostering better performance for our agriculturally derived ingredients.  Our partnership promotes sustainable agriculture in our supply chain,  focusing on the production of sugar cane,  and more recently oranges and corn—three of the high-volume agricultural ingredients used in our beverages.

energy EFFICIENCY and climate PROTECTION 
Advancing Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Global climate change,  caused in part by man-made greenhouse gas emissions,  has widespread implications for the planet and the communities where we operate.  Water resources,  public health,  agriculture and more are at risk.  And across the Coca‑Cola system,  we recognize that climate change has the potential to significantly affect the sustainability of our business and supply chain.  We are increasingly focused on energy efficiency and climate protection to help reduce costs and minimize our environmental impact.  Due to the size and scale of our global system—more than 900 bottling plants,  a fleet of approximately 200000 delivery vehicles and more than 10 million vending machines and coolers—our efforts to improve energy efficiency and decrease carbon emissions can have far-reaching impacts.  When producing and distributing our products,  we aim to use the best possible mix of energy sources while improving our overall energy use and efficiency.  We are committed to effectively tracking and managing our carbon emissions,  and we are taking the necessary steps to do so as a system.  We are investing in renewable energy resources where they make sense for our business,  and we are making decisions to improve the overall energy use and efficiency of our facilities.  We are committed to addressing our own energy footprint.  We are improving our energy efficiency per liter of product produced and working to stabilize our emissions systemwide.  In 2008,  working with WWF,  the Coca‑Cola system set global targets for energy management and climate protection within our manufacturing operations— achieve a 5 percent absolute emissions reduction in developed countries and grow our business without growing our carbon emissions by 2015.  Each of these targets is compared to a 2004 baseline.  The Coca‑Cola system is working to meet each goaland we are committed to reporting our progress.  From 2004 to 2009,  our total unit case volume grew 23 percent while our emissions grew 12 percent.  In that same time period,  our emissions in developed countries improved 8 percent (see chart on page 21).  We are making progress,  but we have more work to do to meet these targets.

energy EFFICIENCY and climate PROTECTION 
Managing Our Carbon Emissions As we build our business,  we remain committed to protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our system.  Through strategic partnerships and innovative problem solving,  we continue to identify and leverage new technologies to reduce our carbon emissions.  Our multifaceted strategy makes climate change a priority.  We have built energy efficiency and climate protection targets into our business plans.  We are focusing our efforts to reduce emissions in three key areas: manufacturing,  fleet/transportation and sales equipment (coolers and vending machines).  We remain committed to publicly disclosing our systemwide emission information.  And we engage in a variety of partnerships with governments,  industry and NGOs to find solutions for climate change.  
CUTTING EMISSIONS THROUGH LOWER-CARBON ENERGY SOURCES We are continually looking for ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy resources.  Some of our bottling partners are installing solar panels on their bottling facilities to help reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.  The solar panels capture sunlight across a 360-degree surface,  converting light energy into electricity.  Additional investments are being made in biodiesel and wind power generation technologies,  among other initiatives.  Coca‑Cola Amatil Limited is distribution center in New South Wales,  Australia,  generates 148 megawatt hours of clean,  renewable energy annually—more than 15 percent of its energy use—through a 700 solar panel installation on its facility.  This is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 148 metric tons per year.  Coca‑Cola Enterprises Inc.  (CCE)1 installed state-of-the-art solar panels at facilities in MaconGeorgia,  and Coachella,  California.  CCE expects to save 70000 kilowatt hours of energy in the first year.  Coca‑Cola Hellenic is advanced energy-saving production plant in Romania uses Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technology,  which will reduce annual CO2 emissions across its operations by more than 20 percent.  The new CHP technology supplies highly efficientclean electricity as well as heat and cooling for the production facility.  This CHP technology installation is one of 15 that Coca‑Cola Hellenic plans to introduce in its facilities in 12 countries by 2020.  1

Kent also gave a keynote speech on 'Business Leadership Beyond 2009" at the UN Global Compact and Copenhagen Climate Council event.  The Company also participated in WWF is 'Let the Clean Economy Begin" campaignalong with other Climate Savers members.  
Hopenhagen In December 2009,  we supported Hopenhagen,  a movement to empower citizens to help create a better future for our planet by working together to combat climate change.  Through our efforts to promote Hopenhagen,  we ran print and online advertising,  including a Facebook applicationto encourage people to go to our website to learn more about the initiative.  Once on our website,  people were offered the opportunity to be a signatory to the UN Climate Petitionwhich was presented at COP15.  More than 6 million people signed the petition through our website and Facebook application.  
ADVANCING REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGIES We are working to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our more than 10 million vending machines and coolers through the installation of HFC-free systems and intelligent energy management devices.  In 2009,  through engagement with Greenpeacethe Coca‑Cola system pledged to transition to 100 percent HFC-free equipment for all new coolers and vending machines by the end of 2015.  As a result of the commitment to eliminate the use of HFCs in our refrigeration equipment,  carbon emission reductions are projected to exceed 525 million metric tons over the life of the equipment—the equivalent of taking more than 11 million cars off the road for one year.

sustainable packaging 
Creating Sustainable Packaging Packaging plays an essential role in meeting consumer needs.  It is the face of our brands around the world,  and it protects the quality of our products during delivery to consumers.  However,  many people consider packaging,  once emptied,  to be a burdensome problem.  We are actively working throughout the Coca‑Cola system to create solutions by advancing a global sustainable packaging strategy aimed at preventing waste over the life of our packaging.  With approximately 85 percent of our volume delivered in recyclable bottles and cans,  we focus on those packages by creating more value with less material,  using more recycled and renewable materials,  and increasing community recycling.  Today our packaging goals focus on three priority areas for effectively preventing waste: optimizing packaging efficiency; increasing our use of renewable and recycled materials; and eliminating waste to landfills through recycling.  Systemwide packaging efficiency efforts in 2009 avoided the use of approximately 85000 metric tons of primary packaging,  resulting in an estimated cost savings of more than $100 million.  Key initiatives driving these results included the continued roll-out of short-height bottle closures which reduce PET use; Ultra Glass bottle technology; traditional packaging material lightweighting; and use of recycled materials in packaging production.  In 2010,  we implemented a comprehensive product data management system for the entire Coca‑Cola system which will help us track systemwide programs and measure our progress against our packaging goals.

UNDERSTANDING OUR PRODUCT LIFECYCLE Our Company has a commitment to fully understanding the entire scope of our product and packaging impacts,  and we are working to advance our Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) leadership.  We are currently implementing a multimillion dollar product data management system that will provide foundational PLM capabilities to manage and track global data for the entire lifecycle of our portfolio—from raw materials through to design,  manufacturing,  consumer use and disposal.  Having this data will enable the Coca‑Cola system to further optimize products and quality,  reduce waste,  and improve efficiency and traceability across our product lifecycle.

Increasing Renewable and Recycled Material Use More than 50 percent of our beverage volume today is delivered in PET plastic bottles.  The added value provided by lightweight,  shatter-resistant and resealable plastic bottles has proven immensely popular with consumers around the world.  Efficiency improvements in manufacturing and transport,  together with high recyclabilityalso have helped make PET plastic bottles a sound environmental choice.  However,  in a world with growing pressure on our planet is resources,  the bar to meet consumer beverage needs with even better environmental performance continues to rise.  To meet this challenge,  we are constantly pushing our Company and our bottling partners to find innovative ways to improve.  We are working to completely eliminate the use of nonrenewable fossil fuels in our plastic bottles while maintaining quality and recyclability.  In 2009,  we introduced our breakthrough PlantBottle PET package—the only recyclable bottle made partially from plant-based materials that can meet our stringent beverage quality requirements.  PlantBottle packaging uses sugar-based ethanol to produce the same PET plastic used today,  but with a smaller carbon footprint.  We are currently investing millions of dollars in PlantBottle technology because we believe in the environmental and supply chain benefits it provides to the Coca‑Cola system.  We are confident that the cost will decrease significantly as we advance the technology,  and the benefits of PlantBottle packaging are already adding up.  In 2010we expect to launch 25 billion packages in nine major markets across Europe,  Latin America,  North America and Pacific.  Through this roll-out,  we will eliminate more than 79000 barrels of oil use for our system this year.  In 2009,  we also continued to enhance the sustainability of bottles through our leadership on recycled content technology.  For nearly two decades,  the Coca‑Cola system has helped advance cutting-edge technologies for using recycled plastic back in bottles,  including investments in six bottle-to-bottle recycling plants.  
While biodegradable packaging can be a sound choice for products that are not commercially recyclablethe process of capturing the embodied energy and raw materials in beverage bottles for reuse through recycling is,  in our viewa much better option.  A one-use bottle is simply not a viable option for our business.  
We plan to use PlantBottle packaging in every bottle we sell by 2020.  
sustainable packaging 
Investing in Recycling Programs Our global target is to recover the equivalent of 50 percent of the bottles and cans we sell worldwide annually by 2015.  In 2009,  our system supported the direct recovery of 36 percent of the bottles and cans we placed into the market.  To realize our long-term sustainability aspirations,  the recovery of our beverage container materials for reuse is critical.  We are actively engaged around the world providing leadership and funding to help establish and grow effective recovery systems to ensure the valuable materials used in our packaging are recovered and used again.  We recognize that a key to driving recovery is ensuring market demand for materials collected is strong.  We were the first company to use recycled content in beverage packaging and have helped fund six bottle-to-bottle recycling plants around the world to help drive domestic end markets.  We also use our trademark to help advance alternative end markets through recycled PET retail merchandise.  This ensures value for the recycled materials and helps educate consumers on what our packages can become when they are recycled.  We recognize we will not be successful acting alone.  We are confident that through collaboration with government and other industry partners we will advance our vision faster and with a larger positive impact.  We are supporting and advancing product stewardship models around the world.  Although recycling and waste management are very local issues,  we are advancing industry recovery models that are closely linked with the economic development of a particular market.  In developing markets,  we are working with government and industry to transform the current informal collection systems into formal models that drive recovery of material while creating sustainable jobs.  In developed markets,  we support extended producer responsibility approaches that include comprehensive recovery of materials through industry recovery organizations.  
Vancouver Olympic Games Activation For the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games,  we were able to make our presence carbon neutral by offering 100 percent compostable beverage cups and lids,  debuting our PlantBottle packaging and activating Coca‑Cola green teams in 172 communities that collected PET containers.  We also used 126 PET plastic bottles for each of the 600 Coca‑Cola Olympic associate uniforms,  totaling 75600 recycled plastic bottles.  
Customer Recycling Partnerships Coca‑Cola Argentina partners with a large-scale retail customer to create 'Optimismo que Transforma" (translated as Optimism Transforms)a program to generate awareness about the importance of recycling inorganic wastes and driving reuse opportunities for PET.  Through the program,  consumers are encouraged to rinse and separate used packages before depositing them in recycling stations at the retailer is locations in Capital Federal,  Greater Buenos Aires,  Córdoba,  Santa FéParaná and Mendoza.

PARTNERING WITH Ocean Conservancy 
GLOBAL RECYcLING ALLIANCE Our Company is the founding sponsor of the Global Alliance for Recycling and Sustainable Development (GARSD),  a network of companies,  governmental agencies and NGOs created in 2007.  The global alliance encourages developing and emerging markets to adopt proven selective collection and recycling modelswhich create a safer and more socially sustainable environment for the millions of people who earn their living from collecting recycled materials.  In 2009,  we brought together GARSD members and other interested stakeholders from around the world to share best practices and see firsthand how government and industry have joined forces to use recycling to help build sustainable communities.  
There are a number of studies under way to understand the effects of marine debris on the environment.  Solving issues like marine debris requires collaboration,  and that is why we have worked with Ocean Conservancy for the past 15 years to help address this issue.  This year,  in addition to providing financial and in-kind support to the North Pacific Gyre research expeditionProject Kaisei,  our Company also sponsored 	 the participation of a scientist from Ocean Conservancy.  The expedition focused on cleanup opportunities as well as continued research on understanding the sources of marine debris and scope of the issue.  Upon completion,  we co-hosted a workshop on accelerating solutions for marine debris with Ocean Conservancy.  The workshop,  facilitated by The Keystone Centerbrought together thought leaders and practitioners from government,  industry,  academia and the NGO community who are committed to advancing research and solutions on the issue.  The workshop outcomes are now providing input into the design and content of the International Marine Debris Conference in March 2011.

water stewardship 
Improving Our Water Use and Efficiency Water remains a high priority for the Coca‑Cola system.  As the main ingredient in our products and an important part of our manufacturing processes,  water is essential to the sustainability of our business.  We have more than 900 bottling plants across our systemwide operations.  These plants serve markets locally and source the water they use locally.  As such,  the health of our business is dependent upon the health of the people,  communities and ecosystems where we operate.  Throughout the Coca‑Cola system,  we are intensely focused on water stewardship.  We focus our water stewardship efforts in three areas: improve our water efficiency; recycle the water used in our operations (wastewater treatment); and replenish1 through community water access and watershed restoration and protection.  All of these efforts are linked to our commitment to the sustainability of the water resources we share.  In 2009,  the Coca‑Cola system achieved its seventh consecutive year of improved water use efficiency.  Across the system,  309 billion liters of water were used to manufacture 130 billion liters of product,  with a water use ratio of 236 liters per liter of product produced—a 13 percent reduction since 2004.  This represents a single-year efficiency improvement of 29 percent from 2008 to 2009.  The Coca‑Cola system has pledged to improve its water use ratio 20 percent by 2012—compared with a 2004 baseline—and we are on track to meet this goal.  This goal also is a key part of our global partnership with WWF.  Since 2004,  we have achieved an average annual increase in water efficiency of 27 percent.  Improving our annual efficiency 285 percent will achieve our goal of reducing our water use ratio to 216 liters of water per liter of product produced by 2012.

Recycling Water in Our Operations While we work to improve our water efficiency for each liter of product we produce and increase our conservation efforts across our system,  we also recycle the water we use in our operations.  Our goal is to return all the water used in our manufacturing processes throughout our system to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life by the end of 2010.  Water used in Coca‑Cola system operations is recycled through a stringent treatment and cleansing process to ensure that our wastewater meets or exceeds applicable laws and regulations before being released into the environment.  In 2009,  the Coca‑Cola system released 179 billion liters of treated wastewater back to the environment and 89 percent of our system facilities—representing 95 percent of product volume—were compliant with our stringent internal wastewater treatment and discharge standards.  Significant challenges have had an impact on our system achieving 100 percent compliance.  By the end of 2010,  we estimate that 94 percent of system facilities will be compliant with our wastewater treatment standards.  Work is under way at the remaining plants to be compliant by the end of 2011.

WATER-SAVING TECHNOLOGY CCE has installed recycle-and-reclaim loops in 12 of its water treatment systems in North America and Europe.  These loops allow facilities to reuse processed water in cooling towers,  boilers or cleaning,  saving an average of 220 million liters of water per system annually.  The goal is to equip 30 facilities with these loops by 2012.  
Source Water Use and Protection To understand and promote management of water resources for the Coca‑Cola system is manufacturing operations,  we have launched a systemwide water resource sustainability corporate standard.  This standard requires each of our more than 900 bottling plants to evaluate the sustainability of the water resources used to produce their beverages,  as well as the sustainability of the water resources used by the surrounding community.  It also requires identification of associated water risks at the plant level and action plans to reduce such risks.  All Coca‑Cola system plants are required to complete this process and be actively implementing their protection plans by 2013.  These source water protection plans address critical water challenges at a watershed level,  from hydrological vulnerabilities to local government management.  As a company,  we are providing guidance,  planning templates,  preparation checklists and training courses to facilitate systemwide engagement with this water resource sustainability corporate standard.  
As part of our new source water protection plan standard,  all Coca‑Cola system manufacturing 	 plants are required to: 1.  Form a water resource management team that includes the plant manager,  plant engineers,  water resource expert(s),  bottling partner and business unit technical and public affairs representatives 
3.  Prepare a source water protection plan with actions,  roles,  responsibilities and resource needs 4.  Implement the source water protection plan 5.  Maintain and update the source water protection plan with source vulnerabilities and source water protection plans updated at five-year intervals and amended on an as-needed basis 
2.  Work with water resource expert(s) to complete a source water vulnerability assessment that inventories risks to all process source waters 
Identifying Global Water Risks Water risks are a function of a number of factors,  including physical availability,  infrastructure existence/pressure,  pricingdrought,  competing use,  increasing demand,  climate changeregulatory limits and social acceptance.  To understand the primary water risks we face in the communities where we operate,  more than 90 percent of our bottling plants completed water risk surveys in their regions in 2009.  Key findings show that our primary water risks are a result of:

Replenishing the Water We Use Throughout the Coca‑Cola system,  our beverages are produced locally and the water we use to create our beverages is sourced locally.  One of our key water strategies is to replenish the water we use by investing in projects that include watershed protection and conservation; expanding community drinking water and sanitation access; and improving water for productive use.  As our plants develop and implement their source water protection plans,  such projects will become more locally relevant to our operations.  By 2020,  we intend to attain our goal of replenishing to nature and communities an amount of water equivalent to that used in our finished beverages.  Since 2005,  the Coca‑Cola system has engaged in more than 250 community water partnership projects in more than 70 countries.  In 2009,  a total of 54 projects were completed,  and 33 new projects were initiated.  In 2009,  we asked respected third-party experts,  including The Nature Conservancy and Global Environment and Technology Foundation,  to work with us to calculate the water benefits of our community water partnership projects to communities and nature.  Initial estimates are that the equivalent of 22 percent of the water used in our finished beverages was replenished through projects completed or ongoing in 2009.  In addition to the water volume benefits,  the pollution reduction benefits from watershed restoration activities were estimated to have reduced sediment load by approximately 3 million metric tons.  Our system also implements water resource education and awareness projects,  which build the foundation for many projects and help support community engagement but do not directly impact water availability or quality and thus are not quantified.  To learn more about our efforts,  see our 2010 The Coca‑Cola Company Replenish Report on the CD on page 45.

Collaborating to Address Child Labor The Coca‑Cola system is one of the world is largest buyers of sugar.  Our direct suppliers in the sugar supply chain are usually sugar mills where sugar is refined.  We do not typically purchase ingredients directly from farms.  We hold our direct suppliers accountable for their adherence to our SGP,  which prohibit the use of child labor.  We also collaborate with our suppliersindustry and other stakeholders to address the issue of child labor in sugar cane harvesting at the farm level.  As a result of a global/local strategy to address child labor in sugar cane harvesting,  we are working to address the issue in several countries,  including El Salvador,  Honduras,  Mexico and the Philippinesto raise awareness of the issue and to remove children from sugar cane fields and place them in schools.  On an annual basis,  we support the International Labour Organization World Day Against Child Labour to raise awareness and support for resolving this difficult issue.  Additionally,  we have participated in roundtable discussions at the U.S.  Department of Labor in 2009 and at the U.S.  Department of State in 2010.

Improving Human Rights Policies and Practices We believe that we must always strive to improve our workplace and human rights practices to ensure we are living up to the high standards we have set for ourselves.  We are engaged in a number of partnerships with stakeholders and peers to ensure we are continually learning about best practices and evolving our own standardspractices and policies on human rights as appropriate.  
HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVES From 2007 to 2009,  we partnered with 10 multinational companies in the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR).  One of BLIHR is accomplishments was to develop a Human Rights Matrix which outlined 28 essential steps that companies need to consider to ensure respect for human rights.  In 2009,  we became a founding member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBIHR),  a post-BLIHR organization focused on human rights in emerging markets.  Working in partnership with the UN Global Compact,  GBIHR provides a platform for companies to demonstrate leadership,  collaborate on issues and share best practices on integrating human rights into the management of their businesses.  
In 2009,  we began working with The Danish Institute for Human Rights on a Human Rights Gap Analysis to identify potential gaps in our global policies measured against the BLIHR Human Rights Matrix and all human rights.  The analysis was used as part of a refresh of our Human Rights Statement and Workplace Rights Policy in 2010,  which we will communicate globally in 2011.  
We are an active member of AIM-PROGRESS,  a global forum of 24 fast-moving consumer goods companies,  which seeks to promote responsible sourcing practices through collaboration.  In June 2009,  we hosted the U.S.  meeting of AIM-PROGRESS in which member companies finalized a framework for mutually recognized social compliance assessments.  This effort reduces audit fatigue,  decreases cycle time to place orders and drives cost savings throughout organizations.  Twelve member companies,  including our Company,  have committed to the framework.

Creating a Human Rights Framework Since 2005,  we have worked with Professor John Ruggie,  UN Special Representative for Business and Human Rights,  on the development and implementation of his 'Protect,  Respect and Remedy" framework for human rights.  In February 2010,  we hosted a day-long conference on respect for human rights attended by more than 100 business representatives at which Professor Ruggie was the keynote speaker.  
Being a Great Place to Work Approximately 700000 associates create the Coca‑Cola system.  Each associate brings his or her unique talents and ideas to work every day to help the Coca‑Cola system achieve the goals outlined in our 2020 Vision.  Associates also represent Coca‑Cola in their communities and are ambassadors of our brands to the world.  Ensuring our associates are happy,  healthy and treated fairly and with respect is at the core of our business philosophy and success.  We strive to create open work environments as diverse as the markets we servewhere people are inspired to create superior results.  We also aim to create environments where people are fully engaged and where the Company is viewed both internally and externally as an employer of choice.

Creating an Inclusive Workplace Diversity is at the heart of our business.  We strive to create a work environment that provides all our associates equal access to information,  development and opportunity.  By building an inclusive workplace environment,  we seek to leverage our global team of associates,  which is rich in diverse people,  talent and ideas.  We see diversity as more than just policies and practices.  It is an integral part of who we are as a companyhow we operate and how we see our future.  As a global business,  our ability to understand,  embrace and operate in a multicultural world—both in the marketplace and in the workplace—is critical to our long-term sustainability and,  specifically,  impacts our ability to meet our 2020 Vision People goals.  Many people across the Company continue to work diligently to help us advance in our diversity journey and build our practices on diversity,  inclusion and fairness.  We also include our associates in the process.  We garner their feedback through formal surveys and informally through their participation in our business resource groups,  various diversity education programs and our Resolution Resources Program,  where associates can work to resolve issues they face in our Company.

In 2009,  we spent $460 million with minority- and womenowned business enterprises (MWBEs),  an 11 percent increase over 2008.  This is nearly a $400 million increase in spending with MWBE suppliers compared to 2000,  when our Company made a public commitment for supplier diversity spending in the U.S.  
For five consecutive years,  our Company has received a top rating of 100% from the Human Rights Campaign for our performance regarding workplace policies for gay,  lesbian,  bisexual and transgender associates.  
Building Associate Communities Within our Company,  we support business resource groups that form communities for associates to engage with colleagues that have similar ethnic or gender backgrounds,  interests,  sexual orientation or work roles.  These groups enable associates to participate in professional and personal growth opportunities through training and education,  community projectsnetworking events and project management.  Each group has an executive sponsor from the Company is senior leadership team who provides guidance on the vision and strategy for the group.  
In 2009,  26% of our Company leadership was female.

Managing Workplace Safety Our commitment to Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) is embedded into everything we do in our Company.  We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all our associates and contractors.  While our overall incident rate continued to improve in 2009,  we regretfully had four associates and three contractors who lost their lives while performing work for our Company.  Four of these deaths were the result of travel-related incidents.  We take these tragic losses very seriously and continue to learn from them as we strengthen our OSH programs.  We continue to monitor the safety performance of our operations through regular independent assessments against our Company standards and requirements as well as applicable laws and regulations.  We continue to improve our safety and health programs and results.  We believe that visible,  demonstrated leadership commitment and a strong health and safety culture are key drivers of this improvement.  We also believe in elevating the capability of our OSH resources in order to drive continual improvement.  Finally,  we strive to improve on our data reporting accuracy as well as on critical issues such as road traffic safety.

We recommend that the Company establish a more sufficient process to utilize the results of these engagements for external communication.    Data collection: Further improve the established internal control system by formalizing responsibilities and gaining commitment from the Coca-Cola system on requirementsexplanations and feedback on deviations to increase the data accuracy level.  We recommend that after reviewing all data,  improvements are made to ensure a better data management process is implemented.    Balance: The Company reports on a large variety of topics.
