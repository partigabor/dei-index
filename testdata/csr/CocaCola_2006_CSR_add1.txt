2006 Environmental Performance 
Environmental Profile Forward-looking statements disclaimer 
Our three principal areas of environmental responsibility: 
The Coca‑Cola Company (the 'Company") is the world is largest beverage company.  The Coca‑Cola system (our Company and bottling partners) sells our products to restaurants,  grocery stores,  street vendors and other customerswho in turn sell our products to consumers.  Before our beverages can be enjoyed by consumers,  they must be manufactured,  marketed and merchandised for sale in customer outlets.  This is the work of our bottling system.  We have more than 300 bottling partners globally,  most of which are independent companies with operations in local communities around the world.  While most of our bottlers are separate companies and we do not have operational control over them,  they are subject to the same environmental standards as those issued by our Company.  We work closely with our bottling partners to improve our system is overall environmental performance.  The environmental impact of our business occurs primarily within plant operations and distribution networks,  as well as from vending machines and coolers.  We concentrate on three principal areas of environmental responsibility: water stewardship; sustainable packaging; and energy and climate protection.

SCOPE OF DATA The information in this report is estimated based on our Company data and data supplied to us by our bottling partners.  Charts and graphs depict average ratios for participating plants,  as well as estimated total system data.  Numbers in charts and graphs have been minimally rounded.  Unless otherwise noted,  performance data in the body of the report refers to average ratios for participating plants.  Production data Data has been collected representing 775 total facilities—743 beverage production facilities and 32 principal beverage concentrate and/or syrup manufacturing plants.  The 201 billion unit case* volume covered by these 775 facilities represents 94 percent of the system is 2006 unit case volume of 214 billion.  This compares with 741 plants (and 90 percent of unit case volume) covered by our 2005 report.  Unless otherwise noted,  offices,  laboratoriesresearch and development facilities,  and warehouses are not included.  Fleet data Given our complex distribution structure and considerable third-party ownership of vehicles,  data on our system is transport fleet is difficult to obtain.  The total system unit case volume collected for 2006 was 45 percent,  representing a 16 percent increase in collected data since 2005**.  A systemwide estimate regarding fleet data is not included in this report,  as less than 50 percent of participating plants supplied fleet data.

Coca‑Cola System Water STEWARDSHIP Performance 
Water Use Ratio (Efficiency) 
Our Global Water Stewardship strategy is built on the needs of our business and the communities where we operate and is informed by a comprehensive water risk analysis of the Coca‑Cola system.  Our livelihood depends on water,  and for us,  there is no question about our commitment to leading in the development of water-sustainability solutions.  
Average Plant Ratios (based on collected data) 
The Coca‑Cola system has improved its water use efficiency by more than 19 percent since 2002.  While our water use ratio has improved significantly over the five years we have reported it,  we project that it may level off in the near future.  Furthermore,  changes in our product mix,  namely the growth in coffee and tea products,  may result in more water-intensive (though not less efficient) operations,  as evidenced by the slightly higher systemwide total water use for 2006.  Total water use for the system also rose due to acquisitions of other beverage companies.  In 2006,  we co-developed a comprehensive water-efficiency toolbox with World Wildlife Fund,  which will be rolled out to our system globally.  Bottling plants will use the tool and benchmark data to set water-efficiency goals.  
liters/liter of product 
In 2006,  83 percent of our system is facilities met our wastewater standard.  We continue to enhance effective wastewater treatment and conservation processes to achieve compliance with our own strict standards,  which often exceed applicable laws.  Our goal remains 100 percent compliance by the end of 2010.

Coca‑Cola System Water STEWARDSHIP Performance continued 
We are currently implementing a variety of water projects around the world.  Together with our bottling partners,  we have established nearly 70 community-based water initiatives in 40 countries.  These projects include locally relevant initiatives focused on water supply,  sanitation,  hygiene,  watershed management,  productive water use,  and education and awareness.  The Global Water Challenge (GWC) was founded as an initiative of the United Nations Foundation with funding and support from The Coca‑Cola Company.  The GWC works to consolidate efforts and mobilize the international community to meet the world is water challenges by helping to increase awareness of and investment in innovative solutions to meet the need for safe water and sanitation.

2006 Environmental Performance 
Coca‑Cola System Sustainable Packaging Performance Most consumer goods depend on some form of packaging for transportation,  display and shopper convenience.  In food and beverage products,  packaging also provides important safety benefits,  such as spoilage reduction and tamper resistance.  The social,  economic and ecological value that packaging provides does not diminish the responsibility of the entire packaging chain to reduce waste and the consumption of natural resources.  Coca‑Cola takes this responsibility seriously and is committed to reducing and optimizing packaging as a core business strategy.  To improve our management of packaging performance,  we initiated an effort in 2006 to build a global online inventory of primary,  secondary and transport package systems by sales and weight.  This extensive databasewhich also tracks system recycling rates,  will enable the system to measure business performance more effectively and assess progress toward our longer-term goals.  In the first year of reporting,  nearly 90 percent of the Coca‑Cola system is global packaging data was captured,  accounting for 98 percent of global sales volume.  We continued to advance our e3 package design efforts focused on improving efficiency,  life-cycle effectiveness and eco-innovation.  For example,  using state-of-the-art computer design software we effectively reduced the weight and improved impact resistance of our most recognizable package,  the glass contour bottle.  The introduction of this new bottle,  'Ultra, " saved 89000 metric tons of glass in 2006,  the CO2 equivalent of planting more than 13000 acres of trees.  Recycling rates for beverage containers remain among the highest of any consumer product packaging in the world,  thanks to their high end-use market value.  To better respond to the growing opportunities related to recycling in the United States,  Coca‑Cola Enterprises Inc.,  our largest bottling partner,  established a new company called Coca‑Cola Recycling LLC in late 2006,  with support from The Coca‑Cola Company.

The Coca‑Cola system also continued investment in closed-loop recycling plants.  In 2006,  Coca‑Cola Beverages Austria finalized a €15 million investment partnership to build the country is first bottle-to-bottle recycling plant.  The plant,  which uses the same technology as our bottle-to-bottle plant in Mexico,  will provide 6000 tons of recycled PET plastic material for new bottles when it becomes operational in 2007.  For more information on our packaging initiatives and case studies,  please visit www, environment, coca‑cola, com.  
The majority of our primary packaging is returnable,  bulk or made from commonly recycled materials.  We slightly expanded our use of bio-based plastics to further assess effective strategies for responsibly managing this material over its life.  	 *	PET–Nonrefillable includes <1% high-density polyethylene 	 **	Fountain includes bag-in-box,  drums,  tanks 	***	Other includes laminates,  Brik pack,  cartons,  pouches

Coca‑Cola System Energy and climate PROTECTION Performance 
Energy Use Ratio (Efficiency) 
The Coca‑Cola system is primary energy and climate impact is due to sales and marketing equipmentmanufacturing and fleet/transport.  The Coca‑Cola system is vending machines and coolers are the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions within the system and produce three times the estimated emissions of our manufacturing facilities.  
Average Plant Ratios (based on collected data) 
The system is energy use ratio has improved 16 percent since the year 2002 through substantial efforts to improve the energy efficiency of our manufacturing operations.  In 2006,  the system experienced an increase in its energy use ratio due,  in part,  to certain products that are more energy-intensive.  An increase in on-site production of PET bottles in 2006 also contributed to the systemwide energy use increase.  We are working to identify and implement additional measures that will continue to improve efficiencies in our operations.  The development of sustainable insulation and refrigeration is at the cornerstone of eKOfreshment,  the research and development program we launched in 2000 to find commercially viable hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free refrigeration technologies.  We have progressed steadily each year since in the area of sustainable refrigeration.  On World Environment Day,  June 5,  2006,  we announced that we had achieved the conversion to HFC-free insulation for more than 1300 models of cold-drink equipment,  representing over 98 percent of the new equipment we purchase.  We also continued to invest in HFC-free refrigeration equipment.  By the end of 2006,  we placed 6000 units with CO2 refrigeration in the market,  including 2000 at the FIFA World Cup™ in Germany,  earning us a Cooling Industry Award.  And our work on sustainable refrigeration is more than an internal environmental program.  Refrigerants,  Naturally!the multi-stakeholder initiative we launched in 2004 to encourage environmentally friendly cooling technologiesenables our engagement with nongovernmental organizations and other businesses.  In 2006,  we continued to make progress on reducing the energy consumption of our system is refrigeration equipment.  We increased the penetration of our proprietary Energy Management System,  EMS-55,  which can reduce energy consumption up to 35 percent.  By the end of 2006,  approximately 200000 of these EMS-55 units were shipped into the Coca‑Cola system.  The combined annual energy reduction is estimated to be more than 250 million kilowatt-hours,  with a corresponding greenhouse gas reduction of over 100000 metric tons.

2006 Environmental Performance 
Performance Data for The Coca‑Cola Company COMPANY-OWNED OPERATIONS The data on this page represents the performance of Company-owned operations,  excluding Company-owned concentrate plants.  As Company-owned operations had a significant increase in unit case volume in 2006 through bottler acquisition or consolidation,  the results on this page will provide the basis for future performance comparisons and do not include a change in performance since 2005.  Solid waste and recycling data are included in addition to the water and energy data to provide a more comprehensive overview of Company and system performance.  Company-owned concentrate plants are excluded from the data in the sidebar due to their significant operational difference relative to beverage production facilities.  Since 2005,  Company-owned concentrate plants* have improved their average water use ratio by 13 percent,  average recycling rate by 2 percent and average energy use ratio by 7 percent.  There was no change in the average solid waste ratio.  Please see the 2005 Environmental Report for 2005 data on Company-owned concentrate plants.  * The data set for Company-owned concentrate plants included 24 facilities in 2006 as compared to 25 facilities in our 2005 data set due to the closure of one concentrate plant.

Verification statement—MANAGEMENT SUMMARY The Coca‑Cola Company (the 'Company") commissioned BECO Group to execute a third-party verification audit of the data and claims in its 2006 Environmental Report and associated information.  This statement reflects our conclusions,  based on random sampling,  regarding the data collection process and the quality of the data itself.  Verification Process Scope and Objectives The verification process focused on reviewing the completeness and validity of claims in the 2006 Environmental Report of the Company.  Claims and data in the 2006 Environmental Report were verified,  and observations regarding the data collection process were made.  The reported Key Performance Indicators: production volume,  water consumption,  energy consumption,  waste,  and recycled waste were verified.  Key objectives of the verification included reviewing: 	accuracy of the environmental information reported; and 	effectiveness of the data collection and validation systems.  Principles of Auditing This verification statement represents the opinion of BECO Group.  The BECO audit team members have not been involved in the development of the Company Environmental Report(s) nor have we been associated 
with the Company environmental programs,  data collection,  and information systems,  therefore this verification is independent and unbiased.  The principles of auditing regarding ethical conducthonest reporting,  professional integrity,  independenceand factual approach are highly valued by BECO Group and have been adhered to during this verification process.  Verification Method BECO conducted the verification process following the 'BECO Group Audit Protocol. " This protocol is based on international standards ISO-19011: 2002 'Guidelines for quality and/or environmental management systems auditing, " the Global Reporting Initiative,  and the AA1000 assurance framework.  The verification process has been carried out by sampling data,  information,  and documents that have been made available to BECO by the Company.  Accordingly,  BECO selected the samples based on expert judgment and risk management.  Consequently,  BECO has not checked or reviewed all of the Company is data,  information,  and documents.  The findings in this report or the verification statement are not intended to be used as advice or as the basis for any decisions,  including,  without limitationfinancial or investment decisions.  
The verification process included two main elements: 1.  Validity of Environmental Data: reviewed the 2006 Environmental Report to identify information in the data and text presented that constitute claims or assertions made by the Company.  Claims,  statements,  and graphs were tested by: 	Data analysis for more than 60 sites,  which consisted of calculating,  recalculating,  and comparing the data to the corporate master file.  	Review of supporting evidence to determine the accuracy and appropriateness of each identified claim or assertion,  including follow-up telephone calls where evidence was not immediately available.  	On-site verification of six sites to verify data and the collection process and compare site figures with corporate figures.  2.  Data Collection Process: reviewed data management processes and validation mechanisms for environmental performance data to assess the robustness of the data and the potential for errors within the data set by: 	Interviews with sixteen staff from the corporate environmental and communication teams to review the scope and implementation of environmental policies and associated programs,  as well as the reporting process.

Verification statement—MANAGEMENT SUMMARY	Interviews with individuals responsible for data collection and validation within three of the six Operating Groups: European Union,  North Americaand Africa.  Findings reported in the verification report cover 	 the completeness and validity of the documentation and the 2006 Environmental Report.  Conclusions are presented in the two categories mentioned above.  Major findings were resolved for the final version of 	 the Environmental Report.  Conclusions of Verification Validity of Environmental Data Based on the representative samples reviewed,  it is concluded that the data presented by the Company 	 and its bottling partners is sound.  We have reviewed the majority of claims in the report and found sufficient evidence to support the claims made.  Some 'human" errors were traced and corrected.  Errors found did 	 not affect the claims,  figures,  or graphs presented in 	 the report.  Therefore,  the conclusion that the 2006 Environmental Report gives a reliable reflection of global environmental performance is justified.
