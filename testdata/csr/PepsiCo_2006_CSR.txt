 PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
 MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN Indra K.  Nooyi Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Dear FriendsWhen I was a child in India,  my mother would ask my sister and me a simple but compelling question: 'What would you do to change the world?" Today,  I know my answer would be that I want to lead a company that is a force for good in the world.  A company that delivers good financial performance while embracing 'purpose" in everything it does.  It therefore gives me great pride to present PepsiCo is sustainability report to you.  Our commitment to sustainability is long-standing and today forms the foundation of our operating strategy which we call 'Performance with Purpose. " It means we bring together what is good for business and good for the world.  Our goals,  like my mother is questionare simple,  but the journey is long.  This report will demonstrate that PepsiCo has made considerable progress,  yet we know there is much more to be done.  Our priorities under the Performance with Purpose strategy have been consistent.  We are focused on driving sustainability against three priorities: 
 Human Sustainability: Nourishing consumers with a range of fun and healthy products,  and making the healthier choice the easy choice.   Environmental Sustainability: Replenishing the environment,  and working toward a net-neutral impact on the environment in which we operate.   Talent Sustainability: Cherishing our employees,  and making PepsiCo the most desirable place for people of all backgrounds to build a career.  These priorities reflect the many challenges PepsiCo faces: rising obesity and the need for more balance between energy intake and physical activity; food safety; water quality and scarcity; energy efficiency,  emissions and climate change; increasing amounts of waste and the need for more recycling; hiring and retaining the best people and helping them achieve work-life balance; to name a few.  
is what makes PepsiCo such a good company.  One notable example is that in 2007PepsiCo was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and again to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index.  We are proud that this exhaustive review of our sustainability work has led to PepsiCo being recognized as among the world is most sustainable companies.  I thank everyone who has worked with us to make this positive difference.  I look forward to continuing to work with you.  Cordially Indra K.  Nooyi Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
No one person,  and no one companycan solve them all.  But each one of us can make a difference.  And every associate I have spoken with at PepsiCo wants to make that difference.  This

Our success depends on a thorough understanding of our customers,  consumers and communities.  Caring means going the extra mile.  Essentially,  this is a spirit of growing rather than taking.  Sell only products we can be proud of.  The test of our standards is that we must be able to personally endorse our products without reservation and 
consume them ourselves.  This principle extends to every part of the businessfrom the purchasing of ingredients to the point where our products reach the consumer is hands.  Speak with truth and candor.  We speak up,  telling the whole picturenot just what is convenient to achieving individual goals.  In addition to being clear,  honest and accuratewe take responsibility to ensure our communications are understood.  Balance short term and long term.  We make decisions that hold both shortterm and long-term risks and benefits in balance over time.  Without this balance,  we cannot achieve the goal of sustainable growth.

RISK MANAGEMENT Risks and Responses PepsiCo is subject to risks in the normal course of business due to adverse developments with respect to several areasincluding those relating to sustainability.  These risks include: product demand; our reputation; information technology; supply chain; retail consolidation; the loss of major customers and failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners; global,  economic,  environmental and political conditions; the regulatory environment; workforce retention and outsourcing; raw materials and other supplies; competition; and market risks.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As such,  we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assessprioritize,  manage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  
Product demand Risk: Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.  Our 
continued success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends,  such as consumer health concerns about obesity,  product attributes and ingredients,  as well as product innovation.  Response: With respect to risks related to demand for our productssuch as consumer health concerns,  we continued to focus on the development of products that respond to consumer trends,  including formulating products to lower sugarfats and sodium and adding ingredients and new products that can deliver nutritional benefits.  For example,  at FLNA we introduced a new portion control line of 100-calorie offerings,  and we switched to NuSun sunflower oil,  an oil containing 90% mono-and polyunsaturated fats and less saturated fat than most other cooking oils,  for our Lay is and Ruffles potato chips.  We reduced the amount of saturated fats in our Walkers crisps in the United Kingdom by 70% and the amount of salt by 25%.  In an effort to help address the growing concerns regarding childhood obesity trends in the United States,  we joined with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation,  a joint initiative of the William J.  Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association,  to set voluntary beverage guidelines for U.S.  schools and limit portion sizes and establish voluntary guidelines for snacks and side items in U.S.  schools.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
Our reputation 
Supply chain 
Risk: Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  
Risk: Disruption of our supply chain could have adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  
Response: Through the PepsiCo Product Integrity Council (PPIC),  a crossfunctional forum to share leading practices and confer about areas of potential risk,  we completed a third-party review of our food safety and food security programs which helped identify opportunities to better leverage internal practices across all our businesses.  We also enhanced our product sampling and testing protocols.  
Information technology 
Risk: If we are not able to build and sustain proper information technology infrastructure,  our business could suffer.  Response: We have embarked on a multi-year Business Process Transformation (BPT) initiative that includes the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application,  as well as the migration to common business practices across our operations.  
Response: We continued to assess our capability to address disaster recovery,  crisis management and business continuity.  For example,  having recognized the potentially significant impact of a pandemic such as avian influenza,  we formed a cross-functional,  cross-divisional Pandemic Planning Team that worked to develop strategies and tactics to mitigate that impact.

 The PepsiCo Executive Committee (PEC),  comprised of our most senior leadership group and chaired by PepsiCo is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   Five Division Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of cross-functional senior management teams which meet quarterly to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address operating risks within our businesses and Information Technology Services group.   PepsiCo is Risk Management Office,  headed by the Vice President,  Enterprise Risk Management,  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PEC and the DRCsidentifies and assesses emerging risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication among the divisions,  as well as with PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors.

Risk Identification 
Risk Response 
This takes place annually from both a top-down (PEC) and bottom-up (DRC) viewpoint.  Our risk identification efforts seek to evaluate both external risks (customer trends,  consumer trendsgovernment and public policy risks),  as well as risks associated with internal capabilities.  
Following our prioritization of risks,  the PEC and DRCs are required to explicitly determine the response to each significant risk.  The responses include accepting,  avoiding,  mitigating and transferring (via third party insurance).  The DRCs also identify which risks will be monitored on an ongoing basis and what measurement index will be used for such a purpose.  
Risk Assessment After identifying our most significant inherent risks,  each assessing body (PEC,  DRCs,  Risk Management Office (RMO) ) assesses the most significant risks from both a probability,  impact and vulnerability perspective at two levels inherent and residual.  This assessment requires that we fully understand the existing capabilitiescontrols,  programs,  insurance coverage and other mitigating factors that enable an accurate assessment of the risk.  
Risk Prioritization After assessment,  all risks that exceed a predetermined threshold are prioritized by both assessment itself as well as the ability to influence and/or mitigate.  In addition,  the RMO aggregates the risk assessment information to look for risk interdependencies and common mitigation solutions.  
Communication Each DRC is required to summarize its risk management efforts by providing meeting minutes,  as well as semiannual submissions of risk maps and 'heat maps. " Risk maps are used to document specific information about identified risks,  including the likelihoodthe impact and risk response.  'Heat maps" provide an aggregate view of the Company is risks.  For PepsiCo is top risks,  PepsiCo has assigned Executive Risk Owners that are responsible for understanding the risk across the Company and providing annual updates to the PEC as well as the Audit Committee and Board of Directors,  depending upon the risk area.  The Executive Risk Owners are required to provide risk templates that provide a company-wide assessment and description of mitigation efforts 
across the Company.  A semi-annual risk management update is provided to the PepsiCo Audit Committee,  during which our risk profile,  risk mitigation efforts and risk management process are discussed.

Communications with the Board of Directors To facilitate communications with our shareholders,  we provide a telephone number,  mailing address and electronic link to contact the Board of Directors.  These may be found under 'Contact the Board of Directors/Audit Committee" in the Corporate Governance section of our website and page 8 of PepsiCo is 2007 Proxy Statement.  In addition,  PepsiCo is Proxy Statement,  which is distributed to all shareholders,  details the process for contacting the Board,  a Committee of the Board or an individual member of the Board.  The PepsiCo Corporate Law Department reviews all communications sent to the Board of Directors relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Board and its Committees.  The Corporate Law Department maintains a log of all such communications and regularly provides a summary of communications to the Board.  Certain communications are sent to the Chair of the relevant Board Committee,  the Presiding Director or to an individual Board member,  as applicable.

Shareholder Proposals Shareholders wishing to submit shareholder proposals may do so in accordance with the instructions on page 45 of the Proxy Statement.  One shareholder proposal,  pertaining to Charitable Contributions,  was included in the 2007 Proxy Statement.  The resolution did not receive enough votes to pass.  
Board and Executive Compensation Most of the annual compensation provided to directors is tied to PepsiCo stock performance.  Directors receive a straight-forward compensation package that includes a market competitive annual stock unit grant and annual retainer that can be deferred into PepsiCo stock units.  Directors do not receive any meeting fees,  nor do they have a retirement plan or receive any benefits such as life or medical insurance.  Pay levels for executive officers are designed to be competitive and,  most importantly,  align with the Company is performance.  Pay-for-performance is a critical policy in designing our executive compensation and,  as a result,  our 'pay mix, " defined as the amount of fixed base salary relative to at-risk annual and long-term cash incentive awards and at-risk equity-based awards,  places the greatest emphasis on variable pay incentives.  As a result,  over 90% of our Chairman and CEO is target total compensation is variable and at-risk.  Performance-related annual incentive awards are earned based on the achievement of Company and individual performance measures.  In particular,  Company

Services said that in 20062007,  PepsiCo outperformed 
992% of the S&P 500 companies and 100% of the companies performance includes financial performance measures related to profit,  net revenue and volume growth.  Individual performance includes measures relating to an individual is contribution to PepsiCo is strategic business imperatives,  such as improved operating efficiencies and driving PepsiCo is Performance with Purpose priorities in the areas of human sustainability,  environmental sustainability and talent sustainability.  We believe that grants of stock-based incentive awards are the best way to align the interests of executives with those of PepsiCo is shareholders.  Longterm incentive awards to PepsiCo executive officers are comprised of:  Stock options,  which have no intrinsic value to the recipient on the date of grant and only deliver meaningful value if PepsiCo achieves sustained long-term stock price growth Performance-based restricted stock units,  which only vest if pre-approved earnings targets are achieved,  and  Performance-based long-term cash awards,  which are earned based on the same Company and individual performance measures used to determine performance-related annual incentive awards.  
Not only is the value of PepsiCo is long-term incentive awards linked to Company and stock price performancebut the size of the award is also performance-based.  For examplethe actual size of grants awarded to executive officers range from 0% to 150% of target based on PepsiCo is financial performance relative to our Board-approved peer group as well as each executive officer is individual contribution to PepsiCo is strategic imperatives.  
Conflicts of Interest Our Code of Conduct,  which applies to all PepsiCo employees and directorscontains clear guidelines regarding conflicts of interest.  PepsiCo is Corporate Governance Guidelines also include director independence standards to address potential director conflicts of interest.  
Director Nomination Process The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not solicit director nominations but will consider recommendations for director nominees if the individuals recommended meet certain minimum Board membership criteria detailed on pages 9-10 of the 2007 Proxy Statement and,  if so,  if the candidates expertise and particular set of skills and background fit the current

HUMAN SUSTAINABILITY 
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
HUMAN SUSTAINABILITY Financial results tell only part of the PepsiCo story.  As we achieve success with profitable growth,  we continuously give back to the communities we serve.  We believe we can do this in ways directly related to our business,  beginning with our products.  We have a fundamental belief that humans need to be nourished in multiple dimensions — ranging from simple treats to healthier eats.  We call this human sustainability and we are continually transforming our portfolio of products to meet consumer needs.  
Product Responsibility: Our Portfolio As a food and beverage company,  we nourish people in many forms.  We nourish them with treats and we nourish them with nutritious foods and beverages.  In between is a wide range of our foods and beverages that are enjoyable,  including those that are reduced in sugar,  fats or sodium when compared to our more indulgent varieties.  Our goal is to offer great tasting foods and beverages for the wide spectrum of needs and tastes.  We consider the health and wellness and safety aspects of our products from start to finish.  There is nothing more important.  In line with current interest in health and wellness and efforts to address the obesity crises,  we are changing our portfoliomoving toward the nutritious end of the spectrum.  
 Are formulated to have specific health or wellness benefits,  and/or  Are reduced in calories or nutrients such as fat,  sodium or sugar.  
Smart Spot In the United States and Canada,  we have introduced the Smart Spot to make it easier for consumers to identify those of our products that can contribute to healthier lifestyles.  All PepsiCo products carrying the green Smart Spot symbol meet nutrition criteria based on authoritative statements from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration and the National Academy of Sciences or provide other functional benefits.  Products that carry the Smart Spot:  Contain at least 10% of the Daily Value of a target nutrient (i, e.  proteinfiber,  calcium,  iron,  vitamin A,  vitamin C) and meet limits for fat,  saturated fat,  trans fat,  cholesterol,  sodium and added sugar,  and/or 
In 2006,  43% of PepsiCo Net Revenues in the United States and Canada came from Smart Spot products,  and Smart Spot eligible products represented twothirds of our growth in North America.  We have set a goal of deriving 50% of all our U.S.  revenues from Smart Spot eligible products by 2010.  Today,  the Smart Spot symbol appears on more than 300 products in the United States.  It helps retailers join us in the drive to sell healthier products by aligning our product strategy with their promotion and selling strategies.  Each Smart Spot eligible product label includes the Smart Spot symbol and an explanation of why the product meets Smart Spot criteria.  We complement the science and marketing savvy with detailed scorecards and tracking processes.  
Outside the United States,  our progress has also been extraordinary and we are transforming our portfolio in both welldeveloped and less-developed markets.  When we have a success with one product in one part of the world,  we want to be able to extend it globally.

Portfolio Transformation 
In 1997,  Quaker Oats petitioned for and received from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the first food-specific health claim granted by the FDA.  The claim provides that the soluble fiber from oats can help reduce heart disease risk.  Scores of Quaker-branded oat-based products qualify for and make this health claim.  
This journey to transform our portfolio has been in process for nearly two decades.  To guide us on our journey we rely on science to transform our products and intensive engagement with key internal and external experts to guide us in delivering real improvements.  At the same time,  we encourage physical activitywhich increases the number of calories out on the calorie-in/calorie-out nutritional balance scale.  We have achieved more balance and are continuing to achieve it in our portfolio — in three key ways: 1.  S trategic portfolio transformation through acquisitions,  large-scale and 'tuck-ins, " which drive nutrition.  2.  Reformulation of existing products to driver healthier consumption and nutrition.  3.  Development of new products that drive healthier consumption and nutrition.  
Strategic Portfolio Transformation For the past two decades,  PepsiCo has been on a journey that reflects a proactive portfolio transformation.   We began in 1988 to become a 'total beverage company" and began adding new beverages,  waters and sports drinks to our traditional carbonated soft drink products.   In 1992,  we began a partnership with Thomas J.  Lipton Co.  to sell ready-todrink tea brands.   In 1994,  we introduced Aquafina bottled water,  and we also began a strategic partnership with Starbucks to market ready-to-drink coffee.  
 In 1998,  we acquired Tropicana and expanded the Dole brand.   We acquired SoBe,  the producer of several varieties of tea and energy drinks in 2001.   Our merger with Quaker in 2001 put us in the cereal and side dish business —putting us firmly in the business of good nutrition.  
 Recent,  smaller 'tuck-in" acquisitions are adding such products as nuts,  rice crackers,  fruit smoothies,  pita chips and various juices to our portfolio.   In 2006,  we announced our alliance with Ocean Spray to marketbottle and distribute cranberry juice products.  
 Gatorade Thirst Quencher sports drinks and Propel Fitness Water also became a part of our beverage business when we merged with Quaker in 2001.  Recent sample 'tuck-in" acquisitions Acquisition

Product Reformulation We start with science and authoritative statements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Academy of Sciences for classifying ingredients.  We look at nutrition-based standards for fats,  sugar,  cholesterolfiber,  vitamins and other ingredients.  Then,  we begin by re-formulating our products to reduce the level of indulgent ingredients like fats and added sugar.  We add healthy ingredients such as fruit,  whole grains and fiber.  Examples of our product reformulations include:  Removing trans fats  Moving to healthier oils  Development and use of sugar substitutes  Use of whole grains  Elimination of sugar  Natural flavorings replacing artificial flavorings 
 More baking  Fewer preservatives  Processing techniques that improve the nutrition profile.  
greater nutrition or functional benefit.  For example,  new varieties of Aquafina water and Lipton tea,  Gatorade sports drinks,  options for Quaker oatmealzero-calorie soft drinks,  nuts and seeds and fruit snacks.  
In these cases,  a product delivers a specific functional benefit,  such as heart-health or hydration.  Examples include Gatorade,  which delivers superior hydration,  or Baked snackswhich have significantly reduced fat content.  Our goal is to ensure that even though we contribute a very modest portion of calories in a typical diet in most of the markets within which we operate,  we believe we should provide continually improving wholesomeness on a calorie-by-calorie basis.  In addition we continue to give the highest priority to assuring the safety of all our products worldwide and depend upon international norms developed by the Codex Alimentarious Commissioncomplemented by national norms,  to do so.  
New Products Our pipeline of innovation includes a stream of new products that offer 41

In the United States,  support for Tufts University has helped to develop one of the few examples of a community based approach to reducing obesity in children.  Internationally,  we have recently announced support for large scale community based research projects in India,  China,  Mexico and the United Kingdom to reduce the impact of the major risk factors for chronic diseases.  Both the Company and the Foundation are involved in a wide range of initiatives aimed at increasing physical activity around the world in settings as diverse as Mexico (through Vive Saludable which addresses both healthy eating and physical activity in primary schools),  and in the United States (through America On the Move).  We see involvement in physical activity promotion as part of our commitment to promoting better understanding of energy balance.  
This is a PepsiCo program now in implementation across Mexico and Latin America.  The program is a commitment to promote healthy lifestyles,  including diet and exercisefor consumers and employees.  It is focused on reducing the risk of nutrition-related health problemsincluding obesity.  
Alliance for a Healthier Generation In 2006,  PepsiCo became part of this voluntary,  pro-active and collaborative movement involving the U.S.  beverage industry and government and health officials in taking steps to adopt a practical school vending policy in the United States.  PepsiCo partnered with the American Heart Association and the William J.  Clinton Foundation.  Called the Alliance for a Healthier Generation,  its goal is to develop model school wellness programs,  take a comprehensive approach to fitnesshealth and nutrition,  and teach students

Our Approach We approach water and energy environmental performance with four key strategies: 1.  Overall conservation 2.  Process change 3.  Innovation,  including new,  creative technologies and approaches.  4.  O  ptimize renewable or low impact sources for water and energy to the greatest extent possible.  
In the United Kingdom,  two champions of sustainability stand in front of tanks holding starch removed from the water used to make products.  
Water Overall Conservation Capturing and Re-circulating — During fruit processing,  the Tropicana plant in Bradenton,  Florida captures and re-circulates approximately 550000 gallons of water a day from feed mill evaporators to reuse in washing and cleanup operations.  Another 150000 gallons a day of city reclaim water is used for irrigation and special utility services.  The Fort PierceFlorida Tropicana facility captures approximately 150000 gallons per day during fruit processing.  Irrigation — Five Frito-Lay locations use treated wastewater to irrigate more than 1300 acres of alfalfa and Bermuda grass hay grown for animal feed in the United States.  Starch Removal — In making potato chips,  water is used to wash away the excess starch that comes from 
the potato slices.  Once the starch is removed,  the water is cleaned and recycled for use in processing operations.  In the United StatesFrito-Lay recovers almost 66 million pounds of starch a year,  reducing the waste load to municipal wastewater treatment plants.  The recovered starch is a valuable product for other industries to use.  Starch Removal and Reuse — In the United Kingdom,  the starch removed from the water is processed to food grade level and can be reused in our own products.  Cooling with Recycled Water — Several QTG facilities use recycled water for cooling water and plant maintenance.  Pepsi Bottling Ventures,  one of our largest bottlers,  put systems in place to collect and recycle the water used to cool the equipment on its bottling lines.  The changes were made at the suggestion of one of the employee/ 
management 'green teams" formed to identify ways to conserve water.  India Efficiency Strategies — In Indiawe have shown farmers techniques to save approximately 40% of their agriculture water by directly seeding rice paddies,  rather than growing the rice through highly water-intensive conventional seeding.  By direct seeding only 1800 hectares of land,  we can conserve water equivalent to the combined yearly use of our snacks and beverage operations across India.  Our company-owned and franchise beverage partners conserved over 14 billion liters of water in 2006.  In our Panipat plant the treated wastewater is supporting aquatic life.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
Process Change Advanced Air Rinsing — Gatorade continues to install state-of-the-art high speed lines.  U.S.  Gatorade lines are now utilizing air-only rinsing,  achieving a 20% reduction in water consumption where installed.  This allows PepsiCo to conserve more than 175 million gallons of water annually.  The technology also has been incorporated as standard design across our newest hot-fill plants,  which means that once those newest plants are on-line,  PepsiCo will conserve an additional 210 million gallons of water a year.  Improved steam condensate return — In the United Kingdom,  for example,  steam reduction will generate savings.  Low-water Corn Cook — Frito-Lay developed a process which reduces the amount of water and heat used to cook corn for tortilla chips and Fritos by 25%,  and the redesign of washer spray nozzles optimize the flow,  pressure and orientation.  These systems are installed in approximately 75% of the corn processing lines in the United States.  Gatorade is installing air-only rinsing technology at its plants.  
Innovation Membrane bio reactor to treat and re-use waste water — We installed the first membrane bio reactor in our Florida Gatorade plant in 1998.  Currently 85-90% of the process wastewater from the plant feeds into a municipal 'grey water" line and is used for local irrigation and municipal power plants for turbine cooling.  Now,  we are taking this to the next level to treat and re-use the water ourselves for such things as cooling towers.  Potatoes in the Desert — In Chinawe have developed a method to grow potatoes under desert conditions that uses pivot irrigation systems to save water.  Bottlers — Our independent bottlers are saving water in many ways:  Buffalo Rock,  the Pepsi bottler in Birmingham,  Alabama,  reclaims 15 
million gallons of water a year from their rinsing process.  That is enough to fill their 40 thousand gallon water tank every day and more.   Pepsi Bottling Ventures collects and recycles water used to cool equipment on its bottling line,  conserving 25 million gallons per year.   Pepsi Bottling Group water recovery systems installed on the reverse osmosis filters conserve 280 million gallons of water annually.  
Water Sources For new sites,  each of our businesses applies the elements of an environmental site assessment,  similar to the EPA/ASTM Standard for Phase One Environmental Site Assessment.  With specific regard to water sources,  in the United States,  we utilize a mixture of municipal supplies,  which may be 
from surface or groundwater sourcesand private wells.  The selection and management of municipal sources fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and any applicable corresponding state authority.  These sources must comply with the EPA National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and any other applicable regulations and practices related to water resource selection and development (for example site selectionwell construction,  drought management plans,  and many other elements).  Sites are selected to assure ample water supply and minimal impact to the local watershed.  PepsiCo is involved as a full supporter and Advisory Board member in the development of a Water Resource Assessment Tool which has been introduced by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
(WBCSD),  in conjunction with a world recognized environmental consulting firm.  This tool provides an assessment of relative water availability (abundance,  stress,  scarcity) for any physical location coordinates entered,  in addition to a wealth of other water-related information.  This is the first comprehensive tool of its kind that was entered into the public domain completely free of charge—for use by any and all business sectors,  governments,  NGOs,  and other stakeholders.  It was launched August 2007 to great acclaim during World Water Week in Stockholm.  
Water Quality Our facilities in the United States are primarily supplied by municipal water sources.  As such,  these sources comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR),  which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with EPA quality requirements.  Our facilities in the United States are,  in essence,  consumers of this municipal drinking water just as are residential customers of the same supplies.  As such,  the quality data for the water that is purchased is available from the municipal water purveyors,  whether the purchaser is PepsiCo,  one of our franchise partners,  or a home consumer.  Similarly outside the United Statesmany of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources,  and the same approach would apply—the governing national and local regulations for water resources and water quality would,  and do,  apply.  In areas of the world where we develop our own water sources (for example,  extraction from commercial wells) we do so in 
The China Mother Water Cellars Project increases water availability in remote areas of China.  
full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources.  In these cases,  we work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business and thereby to help support the local community and economy,  is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource.  Where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sourcesevery source is tested by an approvedexternal laboratory which is capable of reporting drinking water testing results.  The test protocol is based on the most current revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality,  and also includes testing required by local authorities as well.  Every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified,  which includes using government-accredited/recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of roughly 100 parameterscovering many classes of raw water chemical/physical constituents.  In addition,  the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be microbial and chemically safe.  We also believe that protection of water at the source is important; accordingly,  a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel,  which covers areas such as water source selection,  well construction,  and source protection.  At every plant,  the incoming water is then further purified,  using a 
variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization,  to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products—whether these products are bottled water,  carbonated beverages,  or non-carbonated drinks.  In addition to source qualification,  our plants monitor the raw,  in-processand treated water for a core list of parameters,  and at frequencies ranging from hourly,  to daily,  to weekly (depending on the specific parameter and application).  We have also established internal laboratories in the United States and Europe which monitor raw,  treated,  and bottled water quality worldwide.  
Community Engagement PepsiCo has been involved in positive community engagement for decades.  When locating a facilitywe consider the availability of water to the community.  When we build or expand in a water-stressed areawe consider the availability of water to the community.  Two major recent examples of this,  particularly as they relate to water and the environmentare our partnerships with the Chinese Women is Development Foundation (CWDF) as part of their China Mother Water Cellars Project,  and The Energy & Resources Institute (TERI),  a leading environmental NGO in India.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
In China,  we have partnered with CWDF to continue their mission of making water available to the most water scarce regions of China.  The CWDF has touched approximately 1000000 people over the last five years,  through their 90000 cellars and 1200 wells constructed.  The Mother Water Cellars Project has made a tremendous difference in the lives of people.  Where once getting water took hours of walking,  today it is available at the homes.  It is used for agriculture and livestock as well as washing and boiling for drinking.  As a result,  the lives of entire families have been changed.  With TERI in India,  we have a multi-year partnership to take a holistic approach to sustainability in two very diverse villages.  The areas for our community engagement are many,  and include:  Community watershed management,  including rainwater harvesting systems.   Augmentation of existing water systems to ensure sufficient water.   Sanitation and hygiene promotion — including public education,  toilet installation,  waste management systems,  and adequate drainage.   Health and education — to improve awareness levels and provide health care facilities.   Agriculture — improve irrigation systems,  high-yield cash crops,  integrated pest management systemseducation on organic approaches,  and improvement in the moisture content/ retention of soil.  
Water projects in India are changing the lives of families.  
 Enterprise Development — train villagers in mushroom processing.  Train self help groups in income generation activities to help create a viable local economy.  In 2007,  as in previous years,  we were active supporters of World Water Day.  Our most visible activity was with Ethos Water,  which is a part of the PepsiCo water family.  Last year,  Starbucks Coffee Company and PepsiCo,  through our North American Coffee Partnershipsigned an agreement to significantly increase distribution of Ethos Waterincluding co-packing,  distribution and marketing.  
Ethos Water has a unique business model,  which includes helping to raise awareness of the severity of the world water crisis.  PepsiCo is helping to increase the distribution of Ethos Water.  For each bottle of Ethos Water sold,  Starbucks makes a $005 donation to water projects with the goal of contributing $10 million by the end of 2010 to help children and their communities around the world get clean drinking water.  
The two new grants made in 2007in addition to those in 2006,  totaled $212 million.  In India,  working through WaterAid,  a $1 million grant will help develop an integrated approach to water and sanitation-related health problems for an estimated 120000 beneficiaries in Madhya Pradesh.  In Kenya,  working through International Medical Corps,  a $1 million grant will help improve water,  hygiene and sanitation services in Samburu.

Energy 
PepsiCo is installing the largest privately-owned system of photovoltaic electricity generation in Arizona.  
PepsiCo understands it is increasingly important to address climate change.  In addition to impacting our employeescommunities and the world around usclimate change may adversely affect the raw materials and other supplies we use,  including our sources of water and many agricultural products.  Our supply chain could be damaged or disrupted by weather,  natural disasters or other areas related to climate change.  Climate changes may also affect our energy costs.  Many of our programs address climate change issues and include reduction of energy,  encouragement of renewable sources of energy and water programs.  Key actions include our landmark purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (2007) and that of our anchor bottlers (2007),  as well as our membership in the United States Climate Action Partnership (2007).  
Reclaimed land surrounds the Frito-Lay North America Jim Rich Distribution Center in RochesterNew York,  a LEED Gold-level facility.  
Overall Conservation Energy Efficiency — Our facilities are increasingly putting in place measures to reduce the amount of energy used to produce our products.  These measures include installation of Energy Star rated equipment,  energy efficient motors and energy efficient windows and skylights to enhance natural lighting.  Our facilities have also installed variable frequency drive systems,  which allow efficient energy use,  and thermal regeneration systems to capture waste heat.  We perform periodic energy audits to find opportunities to continuously improve.  Waste heat recovery — Frito-Lay is tortilla chip oven stack draft control and heat recovery system,  installed closed-loop,  controlled,  stack dampers on tortilla chip ovens to control the amount of exhaust heat.  Then the exhaust heat is captured and used to heat tortilla chip fryer oil.  The first heat recovery system for fryer oil was installed in San Antonio,  Texas in 2006 and additional installations are being implemented.  Quaker cereal ovens are also being fitted with oven draft control technology to improve their efficiency.  Cogeneration — Frito-Lay manufacturing facilities at KernCalifornia,  and shortly,  Killingly,  Connecticut,  produce their own electricity through cogeneration,  one of the most energy-efficient means of power generation.  Tropicana operates a cogeneration system for producing power in its Bradenton,  Florida facility.  Cogeneration systems help offset utility companies' need to build additional power plants.  Compressor efficiency improvements — A United Kingdom program to catch compressed air leaks included an employee contest.  
Process Changes Cooling equipment — All Pepsi-Cola vending machines,  fountain equipment and cooler display units in North America have been converted to nonchloroflurocarbon (CFC) refrigerants.  More than 99% of all new purchases of refrigerated point-of-sale equipment use hydroflurocarbon (HFC) free insulation.  Refrigerants Naturally! — We have joined with other corporate members and Greenpeace in a global initiative called 'Refrigerants Naturally!' whose goal is to address climate change and ozone layer depletion caused by HFC gases in refrigeration equipment.  We are working together to eliminate use of HFC in refrigerated point-of-sale equipment.  Compressed air — Pepsi-Cola Concentrate operations are optimizing production of compressed air and managing air leaks to save energy.  Fuel Consumption — With most snack and beverage products delivered by truck,  fuel efficiency is important.  Both Frito-Lay and our bottlers use advanced routing technologies and have a  noidle" policy to reduce miles and cut fuel consumption on delivery routes.  Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),  our largest bottler,  has verified the electronic settings on vehicles with electronic controls to ensure idling reduction and speed parameters are set efficiently.  Lighting upgrades — Solar concentrators in our Gamesa business in Mexico have provided lighting equal to conventional fixtures,  saving 30000 watts in a single distribution center.  Many other plants have also had lighting upgrades,  such as our Concentrate plants in the United States where high-efficiency lighting and translucent ceiling panels have been installed.  Potato Chip surface moisture reduction — By reducing the amount of water that is carried into the fryer on the surface of our potato chips,  we have significantly reduced the natural gas required to make the same amount of chips.  
Fuels — Sabritas,  our Mexican snack food business,  has 13000 distribution vehicles,  about 6000 of which were converted over the past ten years to burn liquid propane gas.  This reduces carbon and nitrogen emissions and generates fuel savings of between 15 and 22% (depending on geographic conditions and fuel costs).  
Innovation LEED Certification — The U.S.  Green Building Council recognized the Gatorade Thirst Quencher Blue Ridge facility in Wytheville,  Virginia with its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) designation at Goldlevel status.  At 950000 square feetthe facility is the largest food and beverage site in the world to achieve this designation.  The plant is design helps drive energy and environmental optimization.  The facility has stateof-the-art energy savings measures such as high efficiency boilerswater heaters and calibrated control systems.  Frito-Lay and Gatorade operate three LEED Gold certified sites.  PepsiCo is constructing new domestic manufacturing and distribution sites to LEED standards.  
Photovoltaic electricity generation — Frito-Lay has installed photovoltaic cells at six distribution centers (five in California and one in New York).  We installed the largest privately-owned system at our Arizona service center.  In our China operations,  we have constructed a boiler that uses solar power to minimize the consumption of fossil fuel.  
The Gatorade Thirst Quencher Blue Ridge facility in Wytheville,  Virginia is the world is largest food and beverage site to achieve LEED Gold-level status.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose Walkers Crisps is the first major food brand in the world to display a carbon footprint reduction logo on its packs.  
Group,  Inc.,  PepsiAmericas,  Inc.  and Pepsi Bottling VenturesLLC also purchased RECs.  The combined purchases of these three companies would rank second among the largest purchasers with the EPA,  right behind top-ranked PepsiCo.  
Renewable Energy — In Cupar,  Scotlandour Quaker oat mill is contracting for electricity from 100% renewable sources.  At our Frito-Lay plant in Modesto,  California,  we are building a solar collection and concentration system to supply nearly three-quarters of the heat needed to produce SunChips brand multigrain snacks from solar thermal energy.  In China,  harnessing the sun is energy for sugar processing has resulted in significant fuel savings.  Renewable Energy Certificates — PepsiCo purchased renewable energy certificates (RECs) to equal 100% of purchased electricity used by ALL PepsiCo U.S.  facilities.  The threeyear purchase of more than 1 billion kilowatt-hours annually became the largest purchase to-date.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates the PepsiCo purchase is the same amount of electricity needed to power nearly 90000 American homes annually.  The purchase supports the development of renewable energy capacity nationwide,  including solarwind,  geothermal,  biogas,  bio-mass and low-impact hydro.  Three PepsiCo anchor bottlers,  The Pepsi Bottling 
Biofuels — Tropicana is Ft.  PierceFlorida facility has partnered with St.  Lucie County to burn landfill gas in its boiler.  Landfill gas displaces the use of natural gas and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.  The landfill gas provides the equivalent environmental benefit of 3600 acres of pine or fir forest or removing 1000 cars from the road per year.  These environmental benefits will increase as availability of landfill gas increases.  At Frito-Lay is RosenbergTexas plant,  a third of the steam load for the entire plant is generated by landfill gas.  Greenhouse Gases — Frito-Lay is a member of the U.S.  EPA is Climate Leaders Program.  This is a voluntary program established by the EPA to set goals and track reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across the United States.  Hybrid Cars — Starting in 2005Frito-Lay sales personnel in three zones (Jacksonville,  Florida; Peoria,  Illinois; Las Vegas,  Nevada) piloted a hybrid vehicle program.  Subsequently,  a PepsiCowide hybrid company car program was 
implemented.  As company-supplied vehicles end their lease,  new hybrid vehicles are leased.  In addition,  we are testing two hybrid electric delivery vans for distribution of Frito-Lay products in Texas.  
Carbon Footprint Reduction Logo — Walkers Crisps has reduced its energy use per pack by 33%,  and water use by 45%,  since 2000.  They are currently working on plans to reduce energy use per pack by 3% year-on-yearand water use per pack by 5% year-on-year.  In 2007 Walkers became the first major food brand in the world to display a carbon footprint reduction logo on its packs.  The logo is certified by the Carbon Trust,  a United Kingdomgovernment funded independent business that supports business and the public in cutting carbon emissions and supports the development of low carbon technologies.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
The weight of the 2 liter PET soft drink bottle has been reduced by 39% since 1980.  
Packaging and Material Waste The goal of PepsiCo is sustainable packaging policy is the design and development of packaging systems that are environmentally responsible throughout their entire life cycle.  We have developed a sustainable packaging roadmap to achieve this vision.  To implement this policy,  PepsiCo has established a Sustainable Packaging Council.  The objectives of this team are to develop sustainable packaging strategies,  goals and targets and alternative packaging material technologies,  as well as to support responsible disposal practices.  PepsiCo has taken an industry leadership position in packaging.  Two significant programs are: 
Lighter weight PET bottles are among our initiatives to reduce packaging.  
 Sustainable Packaging Coalition: PepsiCo is a member of the Executive Committee for this industry-leading organization that provides life cycle analysis and design guidelines for sustainable packaging.   Grocery Manufacturers Association/Food Products Association (GMA/FPA): PepsiCo is the GMA/FPA chair for Packaging Sustainability Working Group.  These procedures aim to create an industry-wide public reporting process for consumers,  investors and other stakeholders to understand packaging and environmental improvements in a consistent and transparent manner.  
Reduce Across all of our divisions,  initiatives conducted in 2006 to reduce packaging have resulted in over 20 million pounds of material reductions across PET bottlespaperboard and corrugated materials.   Aquafina 500 ml PET bottle weight has been reduced by nearly a third since 2000.   Gatorade is 20 ounce bottle weight has been reduced 10% and corrugated packaging reduced 70% since the early 1990s,  reducing solid waste by nearly 100 million pounds per year.   The 64-ounce bottle of Gatorade has been reduced 19% since 1987,  with total waste reduction of more than 6 million pounds per year.   A change in design on the seals on Frito-Lay North America salty snack packaging has reduced overall film use by more than 2 million pounds annually.   The aluminum in the Pepsi-Cola beverage can has been reduced 10% since 1993which saves 75 million pounds of aluminum a year.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
 Community PepsiCo India established a partnership with Exnora International,  an environmental nongovernment organization,  to manage domestic solid waste in an environmentally friendly manner.  In 2007,  the collaboration which began in 2005,  was selected by UNICEF as a model project and as a center for international learning.  The project involves reuse and recycling of waste.   PET programs — A recent PET bottle light weight savings program has removed 40000 metric tons of material from eight of our top international (non-U.S. ) markets over the past three years.   Single-piece closures — For our beverage products,  single-piece closures are under development to significantly reduce materials.   'Flexi" bag elimination — Tropicana re-engineered the way it delivers apple juice concentrate in the United States.  Its move to recyclable 'flexi" bags eliminates the need for nearly 43000 steel drums annually.  
Reuse 
Tropicana minimizes landfill waste by using virtually every part of the orange as well as its by-products after the juice is extracted.  
At PepsiCo,  many programs exist to reuse materials,  ranging from packaging to agriculture.  These programs make the most of our resources:  Potato and Corn Solids — In the United States,  Frito-Lay sends close to 20 million pounds of potato and corn solids (potato pulp and peelingscracked corn and corn husks) to America is livestock and dairy farms where it is used for feed.   Chips for Animal Food — Chips that do not meet Frito-Lay strict quality control standards and chips not sold in stores by the Guaranteed Fresh date,  can be used by livestock feeders and pet food manufacturers as a feed supplement.  This process diverts 16 million pounds of unusable snacks that otherwise might have been sent to landfill.   Composting Tea and Coffee Grounds — PepsiCo in Valhalla,  New York is composting the leftover tea and coffee grounds from its extraction process.  The 40 tons of spent grounds per week are sent for local composting,  diverting them from landfill.  
 All the Orange — Tropicana minimizes landfill waste by using virtually every part of the orange,  as well as its byproducts after the juice is extracted.  The by-products become scent extracts and animal feed.  
 Returnable cases — Programs to return cases have been implemented in areas of the world where appropriate infrastructure existsnotably Greece,  Spain,  Turkey,  and South Africa.  
 Oat Hulls — Quaker optimizes the use of all oat hull by-products.  Quaker delivers oat hulls to local animal feed markets and a nearby university that utilizes oat hulls as a raw material for the generation of power.  
 Bag-In-Box — The old carbonated soft drink bag-in-box (BIB) is being reused to produce food and fuel grade ethanal.  
PepsiCo–Performance with Purpose 
Recycle Across all of our packaging platformsstrategies exist to expand and promote recycling.  These programs make the most of our resources:  Recycled material in our packaging — Our beverage cans are made from 40% to 50% recycled aluminum.  In 2002,  we committed to using 10% recycled material in our PET soft drink bottles by 2005.  Thanks to our bottlers,  we met that goal on schedule.   Designed for Recycling — Beverage containers like the ones used by PepsiCo are designed for easy recycling.  Beverage containers are the most recycled consumer packaging in the United States.  
 National Recycling Partnership — PepsiCo helped found the National Recycling Partnership,  an initiative to increase recycling across the United States.   Corrugated and Paperboard — At Frito-Lay,  cartons used to transport bags of chips to retail stores are reused several times before recycling.  In the United States this reduces the demand for paperboard by more than 250000 tons a year.  This recycling effort saves more than 45 million trees from being harvested for paperboard production and annually diverts about 500 million pounds of cardboard away from landfills.  QTG programs reduce our corrugated and paperboard use by more than 
 million pounds saving more than 60000 trees annually from being harvested for paperboard production.   Film Packaging — For Frito-Lay is North American and International products,  Frito-Lay recycles packaging film waste from our suppliers' sites for use in various other products (park benches,  boards,  etc).  
PepsiCo supports many programs to encourage recycling.  
Renewable Sources Both for the production of packaging and the packaging itself,  R&D investments continually look for opportunities to promote sustainable packaging.   Cutting edge technology — PepsiCo innovation teams are working to develop and discover creative packaging solutions,  which include the investigation of cutting edge technologies that promote environmentally-friendly packaging.   Supplier operations — PepsiCo promotes and works with its suppliers to use more renewable energy sources in the production of materials.   Suppliers — In North America,  PepsiCo has increased the selection of suppliers certified in credible resource conservation initiatives.  Examples include the FSC/ Forest Stewardship Council,  SFI/Sustainable Forestry Initiative and Energy Star.

PepsiCo works with our growers to encourage sustainable agricultural practices.  Examples from each of our businesses include: 
Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)  Has developed protocols to wash potatoes at the farm to reduce or eliminate the residual soil shipped to our plants,  thereby allowing this soil to be redistributed at the farm rather than disposed of through the plants waste water discharge and reducing diesel fuel requirements.   Practices low or no till soil preparation which results in lower irrigation requirements.  Pivot irrigation practices are used (versus flood irrigation) which are more efficient in the use of water.   Has developed potato varieties that store longer and are resistant to disease.  This allows FLNA to grow its potatoes in the most efficient agronomic areas across the United States.  This results in higher production per acre.  Higher production per acre minimizes the use of all farm inputs including,  waterfertilizer,  pesticides,  and herbicides.   Practices optimal crop rotation policies which result in improved soil fertility and a reduction in the required nitrogen and other fertilizers.   Practices plant tissue analysis of our raw materials which allows for a more precise application of fertilizer.   Continuously develops new growing areas closer to FLNA manufacturing plants reducing the diesel fuel used to transport inbound potatoes.   Practices the use of cover crops to reduce soil erosion at our suppliers' farms.   Requires an independent chemical use and agricultural practice audit of all of our potato and corn growers in North America.   Includes terms in its contracts with all corn and potato growers that require chemical application practices,  quantities and timing to be in full compliance with the label instructions.
