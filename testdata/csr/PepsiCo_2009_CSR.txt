Our R&D investment has increased by more than 40 percent over three years,  helping us to step across industry boundaries to address core challenges to make our products more nutritious.  
Dear Fellow StakeholdersIn 2009,  PepsiCo made a promise.  We promised to deliver sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for our consumers,  our planetour associates and external partners and the communities we serve.  This promise is the cornerstone of our 'Performance with Purpose" mission: our belief that our financial success — Performance — must go hand-in-hand with our social and environmental responsibilities — our Purpose.  We call this 'The Promise of PepsiCo, " a declaration that includes ambitious global goals — 47 commitments in all — that will guide our company this decade.  As the world is second-largest food and beverage business,  we have a responsibility to help devise solutions to key global challenges where we can have the most impact.  We categorize these responsibilities in three distinct areas: Human Sustainability — addressing diverse and complex global nutrition needs; Environmental Sustainability — being a good steward of our planet is natural resources; and Talent Sustainability — creating employment opportunities and developing our associates while fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.  Our strategy for long-term growth is an integral part of our 'Performance with Purpose" mission.  In fact,  we design our business plans to ensure that the work we do and the investments we make leave a positive impact on society — that is why our 2009 Corporate Citizenship Report is titled Performance with Purpose: Investing in Sustainable Growth.  Challenging economic times are still ahead,  but we will not reduce our commitment to responsible business,  and we are taking action to ensure sustainable,  profitable growth across all our businesses.  Despite many challenges,  we see enormous opportunity for continued growth.  One path to growth is through the game-changing mergers with our two anchor bottlers.  These mergers allow us to create a lean,  agile organization with an optimized supply chain,  a flexible go-to-market system and enhanced innovation capabilities.  Another critical path to growth is to continue to expand our R&D capabilities and increase investments to develop more nutritious products that taste great and add positive nutrition such as fiber,  protein,  vitamins and calciumamong other benefits.  Our 'Performance with Purpose" mission guides the way we conduct ourselves as we continue to seek valuable counsel from key external stakeholders like Ceres,  Columbia Earth Institute and global experts in the nutrition,  science and global health policy communities.  Togetherthese actions will help us maintain our long-term commitment to the overall sustainability of our company.  To learn more about our global goals and progress,  please see our online report prepared using Global Reporting Initiative is (GRI) G3 Guidelines at www, pepsico, com/citizenshipreport.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY While we continue to make great strides on our portfolio transformation,  we are also committed to improving the environmental profile of our operations worldwide.  Most recently,  we opened a facility in Chongqing,  China that is designed to use 22 percent less water and 23 percent less energy than our existing in-country facilities.  In the U.S, our Frito-Lay business developed a fully compostable 10 1/2-ounce bag for our SunChips multigrain snacks,  and the facility in Arizona that produces these snacks just received the Environmental Contribution of the Year award at the 2010 Global Water Awards.  One of our goals is to achieve positive water balance across all our businesses.  For every liter we use,  we intend to return one to the Earth.  Sound impossible? We are already demonstrating that concept across our India beverage operations.  And India is just one step in our journey.  
TALENT SUSTAINABILITY Another crucial element of our promise is our commitment to invest in our associates so they can succeed and develop the skills needed to drive our growth.  As part of this,  we have made our training and development regimen more robust,  providing additional experiential learning for key executives to build leadership skills,  and ensuring our associates have the right skills to successfully lead us into the future.  We also remain committed to strengthening our diverse and inclusive culture.  We are proud of the progress we continue to make,  including increasing the number of women in management globally,  reducing diversity turnover and creating thousands of new jobs in growing markets.  Our efforts have earned external recognition in key talent and workplace rankings,  including Fortune magazine is 'Top Companies for Leaders" list in 2009.  
CONCLUSION We have made significant progress toward sustainable growth over the past several years,  and as we continue to carry out our 'Performance with Purpose" mission,  we are poised to deliver on the 'Promise of PepsiCo. " I look forward to a continued legacy of solid performanceand I'm confident our focus on sustainable growth will go a long way to assuring PepsiCo thrives for decades to come.

As a global companywe also have strong regional brands such as Walkers in the U.K. Gamesa and Sabritas in Mexico,  Amacoco in Brazil,  Lebedyansky in Russia,  Alvalle in Spain and Smith is in Australia.  As an industry leader,  we have a responsibility to help develop solutions to key global challenges,  such as obesity.  We will do this by transforming our product portfolio,  establishing global initiativessuch as calorie labeling to improve nutrition education,  supporting programs that promote physical activity and using our influence to engage in meaningful private-public partnerships to drive positive change.  In 2009,  we announced 11 ambitious global goals and commitments to guide our work to help improve the well-being of people in both developed and developing countries.  We are focusing our work on the products we make and on key policies and partnerships to help us address global nutrition challenges.  Through expanded capabilities and increased investment,  our world class research and development (R&D) team is focused on providing more food and beverage choices that encourage people to live healthier — products that are made with wholesome ingredientsand which offer nutritional benefits.

Adding Whole Grains While Naturally Reducing Saturated Fat and Salt in Global Snacks and Foods As a company focused on achieving sustainable growth,  we have significant opportunities to expand our current snacks businesses in key regions,  extend our reach into new geographies and enter adjacent categories.

PEPSICO U.K.  INVESTMENT IN HEALTHIER OIL total additional cost versus previous year 
In 2009,  PepsiCo announced global goals and commitments that address environmental and social issues,  including goals focused on the diverse and complex nutrition needs around the world.  Among our numerous global goals,  PepsiCo committed to increasing the amount of whole grains,  nuts and seeds,  reducing the average amount of saturated fat per serving in key global food brands by 
PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2009 
15 percent by 2020,  and reducing the average amount of sodium per serving in key global food brands by 25 percent by 2015.  We have made good progress on all three fronts.  In Mexico,  our business delivered 14 billion servings of whole grains through our Gamesa-Quaker snacks,  oats,  and cereals last year.  We expect to contribute an additional 22 million pounds of whole grain to the American diet in 2010 as we modify our process to retain more of the whole grain in Tostitos tortilla chips.  And today,  PepsiCo is the world is 2 seller of nuts and seeds.  Since 2005,  we have led the industry to reduce saturated fats in our snacks like Walkers crisps in the U.K.  and Lay is potato chips in key global markets by investing in the use of heart-healthy oils such as sunflower oil.  In the U.K.,  we have reduced the saturated fats in Walkers crisps by 70 to 80 percent,  removing more than 40000 tons of saturated fat from the British diet from 2005 to 2008.  In the U.S.,  we have switched to sunflower oil,  which is very low in saturated fat,  and reduced the saturated fat content by more than 50 percent in our Lay is and Ruffles potato chips.  In sum,  more than 100 million pounds of saturated fats have been removed from the American diet since 2006.  We continue to invest in R&D capabilities to identify natural,  innovative approaches to reduce the sodium in our global food brands.  Since 2003,  we have reduced salt levels by between 25 and 55 percent across the Walkers portfolio,  removing 2400 tons of salt from the British diet between 2003 and 2008.  At the end of 2009,  we reduced salt levels in Walkers crisps by an additional 10 percent.  To achieve our global sodium reduction goal,  we will continue to make R&D investments to explore breakthrough solutions such as identifying unique natural salt shapes and sizes that deliver the great  isalty" taste while actually using less sodium.  
Looking to Nature to Reduce Added Sugars,  Add Positive Nutrition,  and Preserve Flavors in Global Beverages One of the beverage industry is biggest technical challenges is to reduce a product is sugar while preserving its flavor.  We have unlocked a solution by looking to nature and creating a breakthrough innovation.  PepsiCo and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company introduced a zero-calorie,  all-natural sweetener derived from the stevia plant named PureVia.  This natural sweetener optimizes taste,  preserves the beverage is natural great-tasting flavor and retains shelf life.  Today,  SoBe Lifewater,  which is a vitamin-enhanced water with a high level of antioxidants,  contains the zero-calorie,  all-natural sweetener,  as does Tropicana is Trop50.  Trop50 offers 50 percent less sugar and calories by using PureVia and is the juice industry is most successful launch in the past five years.  In addition,  this all-natural sweetener innovation has been applied to Gatorade,  the 1 sports drink brand in the U.S.,  to produce G2 Gatorade.  With only 20 calories per 8-ounce serving,  G2 delivers the same electrolytes as Gatorade to help maintain hydration.  In 2009,  PepsiCo announced ambitious global goals and commitments that address environmental and social issues including goals focused on the diverse and complex nutrition needs around the world.  We are committed to increasing the amounts of fruits,  vegetables and low-fat dairy in our global product portfolio,  and to reducing the average amount of added sugars per serving in key global beverage brands by 25 percent by 2020.  Progress has been madebut there is still a lot to learn and do.  We are enhancing our portfolio of great-tasting,  lower-calorie beverage offerings within our key brand portfolios such as the Pepsi trademarkwhich includes Pepsi,  Diet Pepsi,  Pepsi Max and Pepsi Kick.  
As our global beverage business grows,  key acquisitions and joint ventures have helped us expand our product offerings with improved nutritional profiles.  Our focus on more nutritious offerings started with our acquisition of Tropicana in 1998 and the 2001 merger with Quaker Oats,  including Gatorade.  More recently,  PepsiCo has acquired or purchased a major stake in Lebedyansky,  Russia is leading branded juice company and the world is sixth largest juice manufacturer; Sandora,  a leading juice company in Ukraine; Naked Juice,  a premium juice company in the U.S. ; V Water in the U.K. ; and Amacoco,  Brazil is largest coconut water company.  We have also partnered with one of the world is most profitable dairy businesses — Almarai — to jointly develop dairy markets throughout the Middle East,  Southeast Asia and Africa.  In 2009,  PepsiCo was ranked as the 1 juice business in Europe and Russia following the acquisition of both Lebedyansky and Sandoraand we continue to expand in India and the Middle East.  In factwe are covering the total value spectrum from premium and mainstream juices to value selections.  In Russia,  we introduced Tonus Active Plus,  a new line of juices that can help bring a variety of benefits,  including a healthy immune system with AntiOx,  improved digestion with BioFiber or nutrientbased energy with Power-C.  There continues to be significant areas of global beverage growthparticularly in developing markets and in evolving categories.  We will invest in those attractive opportunities,  concentrating in geographies and categories in which we are the leader or a close second,  or where the competitive game remains wide open.  
Pepsi Max is the fastest-growing beverage internationally with a  no sugar" label and has had successful product launches across the Middle East and China.  In 2009,  Pepsi Max became PepsiCo is 19th billion-dollar mega-brand.

Encouraging People to Make Informed Choices and Live Healthier PepsiCo is committed to providing clear and useful nutrition labeling that helps consumers make nutritionally informed choices.  Recentlywe have announced significant global initiatives,  goals and commitments to guide our work in this area.  We have committed to display calorie count and key nutrients on our food and beverage packaging by 2012.  In the U.S.,  PepsiCo will display total calorie counts on the front of all beverage containers up to and including 20-ounce packages by February 2012.  On beverage containers larger than 20 ounces,  PepsiCo will display calories per 12-ounce serving on the front of non-juice products,  and calories per 8-ounce serving on the front of juices and juice products.  PepsiCo is committed to prominently displaying calorie information in line with U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance and regulations.  In an industry-leading and voluntary move,  we will eliminate the direct sale of full-sugar soft drinks to primary and secondary schools around the globe by 2012.  Our global sales and distribution policy aims to help schools offer a wider range of low-calorie and nutritious beverages to their students.  This global policy limits the direct sale of full-sugar soft drinks — and encourages the products sold to meet strict nutritional criteria — to primary and secondary schools.  PepsiCo plans to fully implement this policy by January 1,  2012.  PepsiCo currently does not direct-sell full-sugar soft drinks to primary and secondary schools in most of Europe,  Canada and most countries in the Arabian Peninsula.  We have taken a deliberate stand on responsible marketing and advertising to children and joined a group of global food and beverage manufacturers to adopt a worldwide voluntary commitment to advertise to children under 12 only products that meet specific nutrition criteria.  The policy is currently in effect for beverages worldwide and will become effective for all snacks and food globally by January 1,  2011.  PepsiCo has already achieved 96 percent compliance in 2009 in those countries where the company policy is in force,  according to the global audit firm Accenture.

Influencing Positive Change 
Promoting Active,  Healthy Lifestyles 
We touch the lives of tens of millions of people every day.  We are driven by the belief that by joining forces with partners across many sectors,  we can make a far greater impact in the fight to reduce obesity and address other global nutrition needs than by working alone.  
We support programs that use simple steps to encourage people to get active.  
PepsiCo expanded its existing efforts to help reduce obesity in the U.S.  by joining the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF).  This Foundation is a CEO-led organization and is a national,  multiyear effort designed to help reduce obesity — especially childhood obesity — by 2015.  The HWCF intends to help consumers lead healthier lives by offering healthier nutrition options and helping to make energy balance — calories in,  balanced with calories out — a daily habit.  In 2009,  PepsiCo Foundation made a two-year commitment of $25 million to the HWCF.  PepsiCo Foundation also made a $5 million commitment to Save the Children for a three-year program to help ensure the survival and well-being of children living in rural India and Bangladeshwhich together are home to 40 percent of the world is malnourished children.  A three-year,  $22 million commitment was made to the United Nation is World Food Programme to improve the organization is operating efficiencies and response time in crisis situations through strategic counsel and insights from PepsiCo is most seasoned logistics experts.  Another example is PepsiCo is Food for Good (FFG) initiative launched in the Dallas,  Texas area in 2009.  The initiative was launched to better understand the needs of underserved communities and explore ways that we could help.  Partnerships with community organizations are essential to the vision,  and FFG has partnered with Central Dallas Ministries (CDM),  Paul Quinn College (PQC) and the Jubilee Park Community to explore various opportunities in the South Dallas/ Highland Hills area.  FFG aims to improve access to affordable and nutritious foods and help spur economic redevelopment through job and skills development.  In 2010,  PepsiCo will launch a pilot initiative in India that will develop locally relevant,  affordable and nutritious products for undernourished consumers.  And in Nigeria,  we are supporting humanitarian organizations to help improve nutrition for undernourished children.  
In Latin America,  Vive Saludable Escuelas is a proven initiative that teaches children how to add physical activity to their daily lives.  A physical education routine,  designed by Mexico is Sports Commissionis being used by teachers in participating schools.

Taking Action to Minimize Our Footprint Every day,  PepsiCo relies on the Earth is natural resources.  As we grow our businesses in developed countries and expand in developing countries and emerging markets,  we remain committed to minimizing the impact our business has on the environment.  In 2009,  we announced 15 global goals and commitments to guide our work to protect our natural resources through innovation and more efficient use of land,  energy,  water and packaging in our operations.  We are focusing our work where we can make the most positive impact (water,  packaging,  climate change and agriculture) and on key policies and partnerships to help provide solutions to address the world is environmental challenges.  Our global environmental strategy is guided by our Environmental Sustainability Leadership Team,  which comprises senior executives who lead our businesses' supply chain,  global procurementcompliance,  sales and marketing,  and R&D,  among others.  At the front line of our efforts are PepsiCo is sustainability teams at our business headquarters and local manufacturing facilities around the globe.  Associate volunteers form 'Green Teams" that operate at many facilities and through these teams' actions,  we are able to continuously improve our programs and look for ways to scale the good ideas being implemented across our global business.  We also share best practices with our industry peers and suppliers.  Resource conservation is a key priority and we have a global eco-efficiency strategy within our operations that helps us optimize our water,  energy and electricity use through improved methods and technologies.  We are moving toward having all our new facilities meet the U.S.  Green Building Council is (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards — one of the world is most rigorous standards for green building.  In an industry-leading move,  we developed global Sustainable Engineering Guidelines (SEG) based on LEED standards.  We share these guidelines,  which contain 135 solution sets and 18 training videos,  with our suppliers to ensure our buildings are constructed to environmentally sustainable standards.  These guidelines are applied to all new construction as well as major remodels of existing buildings globally,  where practical.  
As a food and beverage company,  agriculture is perhaps the largest element of our eco-footprint,  so we work hard to continuously improve our agricultural practices.  We have developed and published our Global Sustainable Agriculture Policy,  which demonstrates our approach to sustainable development across our entire agriculture supply chain,  including water savings,  waste reuse,  soil protection and chemical use.

Achieving Positive Water Balance In 2009,  PepsiCo India achieved a remarkable milestone: positive water balance.  Through numerous initiatives of recharging,  replenishing and reusing water,  our business in India gave back to society more water than consumed by our in-country beverage manufacturing processes.  The team achieved positive water balance by reducing water used to manufacture our products,  conserving water through sustainable agriculture practices and replenishing water in communities where our operations exist and beyond.  In sum,  the team replenished nearly 6 billion liters of water across India,  which exceeds the total intake of approximately 5 billion liters of water by our manufacturing facilities.  
The PepsiCo team replenished nearly 
 billion liters of water across India,  which exceeds the total intake of approximately 5 billion liters of water by our manufacturing facilities.  
This sustainable initiative supports PepsiCo is global goals and commitments that address environmental and social issues.  Among these goals,  PepsiCo has committed to improve water use efficiency by 20 percent per unit of production by 2015,  strive for positive water balance in our operations in water-distressed areas and provide access to safe water to 3 million people in developing countries by the end of 2015.  PepsiCo routinely conducts assessments to monitor levels of water stress factors in the areas of our operations and proactively initiates water replenishment programs around the world.  The global water goals require continuous improvement to reduce our water footprint.  
16 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2009 
Since 2005,  our manufacturing team in India has reduced water use by more than 45 percent and saved more than 3 billion liters of water through conservation efforts across our beverage operations.  One conservation method includes rain or roof water harvestinga practice used by many PepsiCo India plants to maintain and strengthen water reserves in the surrounding areas.  Three plants harvest and collect rain water in excavated lakes and ponds as well as use roof water harvesting to rejuvenate surrounding aquifers.  In India,  our team has educated farmers to adopt an agronomic practice in paddy cultivation called 'direct seeding. " Rather than growing the seedlings in a nursery,  planting them,  and then flooding their fields,  we are advocating direct seeding,  which allows the seed to be planted directly into the ground,  bypassing the nursery.  This also removes the need for flood irrigation,  reducing water use by as much as 30 percent.  In 2009,  we extended direct seeding to 6500 acres of paddy fields,  saving more than 5 billion liters of water.  Through the construction of check-dams and recharge ponds,  water levels have risen for the first time in years and helped to increase farmers' incomes.  The check-dam project has positively impacted the lives of 12000 villagers in communities where our operations exist.  To build on the achievement of positive water balance,  PepsiCo India has developed a strategic plan to double the replenishment of its consumption of fresh water by 2015.  From a global perspective,  PepsiCo remains committed to its comprehensive and integrated movement to conserve and optimize water usage.  Our initiatives reinforce our commitment to the U. N.  Global Compact (UNGC),  the CEO Water Mandate and the U. N.  is Millennium Development Goals of sustainable access to safe drinking water.  
Moving Toward Zero Landfill We are working to eliminate all solid waste sent to landfills from our plants.  In the U.S.  and U.K.,  we have made considerable progress across our snack businesses.  In 2009,  14 Frito-Lay manufacturing facilities disposed less than one percent of solid waste to landfill — the remaining 18 facilities will achieve nearly 'zero landfill" by the end of 2011.  Over the past five years,  Frito-Lay has eliminated 150 square miles of packaging by reducing materials by 10 percent.  The company has also introduced the first fully compostable bag for its 10 1/2- ounce SunChips multigrain chips.  Frito-Lay consumes 150000 tons less paperboard each year simply by reusing its shipping cartons up to six times.  
PepsiCo has introduced the first fully compostable chip bag.  Today,  every 10 1/2-ounce SunChips bag is 
100% compostable and made with renewable plant-based materials.  
In addition,  almost every piece of waste generated at the more than 30 Frito-Lay plants is reused or recycled.  The 20 million pounds of potato peelings and corn hulls are sent to livestock farms for use as feed.  In 2008,  PepsiCo U.K.  pledged to achieve 'zero landfill" waste across its total supply chain within 10 years.  In 2009,  eight of its manufacturing facilities hit the target of no longer sending waste to landfill.  The U.K.  team cites two key reasons for its success: associate enthusiasm and the appointment of 'waste marshals" who have the responsibility and empowerment to get the job done.  
These initiatives support PepsiCo is global goals and commitments that address economic,  environmental and social issues.  Among the global environmental goals,  PepsiCo has committed to reduce packaging weight by 350 million pounds — avoiding the creation of 1 billion pounds of landfill waste by 2012; work to eliminate all solid waste to landfills from our production facilities; continue to lead the industry by incorporating at least 10 percent of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in our primary soft drink containers in the U.S. ; and create partnerships to promote an increase in U.S.  beverage container recycling rates to 50 percent by 2018.  We are proud of our efforts to lightweight our beverage containers — designing the thinnest possible packaging that still meets government specifications for strength and safety.  We are also committed to ensuring that our containers are easily compatible with U.S.  recycling systems.  
In 2008,  PepsiCo U.K.  pledged to achieve 
zero landfill waste across its total supply chain within 10 years.  
To achieve our recycling goal,  we will work with other U.S.  industry leaders,  retail customers and our bottlers in support of programs and policies that effectively increase recycling.  We will help educate consumers and develop innovative programs to encourage recycling while partnering with our suppliers,  communities and nongovernmental organizations in support of efforts to encourage increased recycling efforts.

Reducing the Carbon Footprint of Our Operations We remain focused on growing our business while making investments in key regions to drive sustainable growth.  We have identified key challenges and developed related competitive strategies for driving sustainable growth that we believe will enable us to achieve our objectives.  One of those strategies is to continue to deliver on our environmental sustainability goals and commitments.  Our climate change focus is on reducing our carbon footprintincluding continued improvement in energy use efficiency.  
73000 liters of fuel 105000 kWh of electricity 2 million liters of water have been saved at a Gatorade manufacturing facility in Guadalajara,  Mexico through a heat recovery project.  
In 2009,  we achieved a 13 percent reduction in per unit use of electricity in our beverage plants and a 6 percent reduction in our snack plants.  There has been a significant reduction of fuel usage as well.  In our international operations,  we have realized an 18 percent reduction in fuel usage per unit in our beverage operations and an 8 percent reduction in our snack operations since 2006.  PepsiCo has committed to improve our electricity use efficiency by 20 percent per unit of production by 2015,  reduce our fuel use intensity by 25 percent per unit of production by 2015,  commit to a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity for U.S.  operations by 25 percent through our partnership with the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Leaders program,  and commit to an absolute reduction in GHG emissions across our global operations.  
18 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2009 
Most recently,  the EPA awarded PepsiCo a 2010 ENERGY STAR 'Sustained Excellence Award" in recognition of our continued leadership in protecting our environment through energy efficiency.  Here are three examples of how we demonstrate our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of our operations: In Chongqing,  China,  we opened a new beverage manufacturing facility that uses 22 percent less water and 23 percent less energy than existing PepsiCo manufacturing facilities in China.  By employing a combination of technologies,  the plant will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 3100 tons,  and conserve 100 million liters of water each year.  Best practices from this plant will be shared with other facilities across the PepsiCo system.  There are plans to build more than 10 additional beverage manufacturing facilities in the near future.  The Frito-Lay manufacturing facility in Killingly,  Connecticut launched its co-generation system,  which will generate almost 100 percent of the site is electrical requirements.  To maximize the system,  the facility will utilize the waste heat,  which is a by-product of steam production.  This new system is another step to help the facility reduce its environmental footprint and help alleviate the significant load already on the heavily congested power grid in the northeastern U.S.  The Gatorade manufacturing facility in Guadalajara,  Mexico implemented a heat recovery project that uses heat from thermally processed beverages to preheat the cool product coming into the pasteurizer.  This helps save 73000 liters of fuel,  105000 kWh of electricity and 2 million liters of water,  preventing more than 200000 tons of carbon dioxide from being sent to the atmosphere every year.  
Protecting Natural Resources in Our Communities Every day,  PepsiCo earns its social license to operate in the thousands of communities we serve.  In each community,  we have a responsibility to support economic development,  to improve our environmental footprint and to help work toward solutions to protect the community is natural resources.  As a responsible company,  we seek to continuously promote environmental sustainability by abiding by applicable laws and regulations where we operate,  and in certain instances,  where we believe the requirements may not be sufficiently advancedwe apply higher standards.  We work hard to protect the natural resources where we operateincluding minimizing our water footprint and improving public access to clean water through alliances with nonprofit groups.  We are also working across our agricultural supply chain to ensure our practices are efficient and sustainable.  We are committed to supporting our local farmers by providing the necessary training and sharing our best practices including water savings techniques,  waste reuse,  soil protection and chemical use.  Through these practiceswe are able to raise farm productivity,  which increases farmers' incomes and improves the quality of life in many communities.  In 2009,  PepsiCo announced new global goals and commitments that address environmental and social issues including our active engagement in the communities where we operate.  Among these environmental goals,  we are committed to apply proven sustainable agriculture practices on our farmed land,  provide funding,  technical support and training to local farmers and promote environmental education with our associates,  among other initiatives.  In Mexico,  our snacks business,  Sabritas,  actively participates in a program that contributes to the overall development of low-income farming families in corn-producing communities.  In partnership with the Mexican Foundation for Rural Development (FUNDAR),  Sabritas contributes to technical and business training for farmers,  transfers relevant technology to the communities and initiates farming 
contracts.  Sabritas and FUNDAR intend to gradually bring about cultural change in these communities that will lead to the creation of small,  sustainable agribusinesses.  In 2009,  the Sabritas/FUNDAR partnership positively impacted the lives of 297 farmers in Mexico.  It increased their yield of cornincreased their income by 165 percent,  and provided 57850 hours of education and training on good agricultural practices.  
In 2009,  the Sabritas/FUNDAR partnership positively impacted the lives of farmers and provided 
57850 hours of education and training on good agricultural practices.  
Throughout the program,  Sabritas works toward an improved understanding of the farmers' needs to become independent business partners.  The program also benefits our business.  Strengthening the capabilities of our suppliers located near our manufacturing facilities means savings in warehouse and transportation costs as well.  We know that engagement with rural farming communities and private-public partners is integral to affecting positive social and economic impact.  We also promote environmental education and best practices among our associates and business partners.  In Latin America,  our beverage and snacks businesses promote overall environmental awareness with our associates.
