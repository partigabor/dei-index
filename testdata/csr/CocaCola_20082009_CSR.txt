 LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
Dear Stakeholders: 
Imagine a better world.  
In the midst of the global financial downturn,  the economic,  environmental and social implications of business are more important than ever.  There is no question that the world is undergoing a massive resetting of prioritiesvalues and expectations.  The Coca‑Cola Company brands are among the world is most recognized and valued.  The strength and sustainability of our brands are directly related to our social license to operate,  which we must earn daily by keeping our promises to our customers,  consumersassociates,  investors,  communities and partners.  It is an honor,  and a responsibility that we take very seriously.  We are dedicated to offering quality beverages for every lifestyle,  life stage and occasion,  marketing those beverages responsibly,  and providing information that consumers can trust.  In 2008,  we launched more than 160 low- and no-calorie beverages and continued to increase our number of fortified products globally.  And just a few weeks ago,  we announced that we will list the energy information per serving for our beverages on the front of nearly all of our packages worldwide by the end of 2011.  
 world where all people have access to safe water,  where packaging has a life beyond its original use,  and where communities are healthy and prosperous.  This is our vision.  The Coca‑Cola Company and our bottling partners are committed to making a lasting,  positive difference in the world.  We are constantly innovating to keep our products affordable and make our business more environmentally and economically beneficial to the communities we serve.  And we believe that investing in the economic,  environmental and social development of communities will help our business grow.  
Productivity  We constantly challenge ourselves,  and our partnersto find innovative ways to make our products and services affordable and our operations and supply chains economically beneficial to the communities we serve.  
In 2008,  our Company committed to drive out $500 million in operating expenses by the end of 2011,  allowing us to reinvest in innovation and fuel our business growth for years to come.  We are assessing everything to increase productivity,  minimize waste and maximize resources—a clear example of where sustainability goals and business objectives align.  By reducing packaging material use,  improving water efficiency,  installing more efficient lighting and using energy conservation tools,  among other productivity initiatives,  we intend to deliver more than half of the savings by the end of 2009.  At the same time,  we have invested in the world is largest bottle-to-bottle recycling facility,  which is expected to generate long-term savings in the cost of materials for the Coca-Cola system and provide benefits to local communities.  Sustainable Communities  The private sector plays a pivotal role in developing sustainable communities through economic development and community involvement.  At Coca-Colawe have witnessed the effect that critical issues—like water needs—can have on a developing economy and how addressing those needs helps both the community and our business.  In Kenya,  for example,  our system built a new water well for a remote village where women spent the majority of their day walking miles to the nearest clean water source for their families' needs.  Now,  instead of walking hours a day to get water,  the women are able to focus their time on creating and operating a local catering and events business.

 also have seen our unique business model create opportunity in developing economiesmost notably,  our micro distribution program in Africa.  Instead of trying to use large trucks to serve thousands of small retail outlets in areas where the roads are often in poor condition,  our bottling partners distribute to carefully selected entrepreneurs who sell our products exclusively 2

to small retailers,  often by bicycle or pushcart.  People who set up what are commonly called Manual Distribution Centers,  or MDCs,  employ others in the area,  who then sell and distribute our beverages to retailers.  Today,  there are more than 2600 MDCs in Africa,  employing approximately 12000 people.  LIVE POSITIVELY  Building a culture of sustainability and social responsibility begins at homewith the people who work for our Company and our bottling partners.  We have embedded our commitment to sustainability into a framework we call LIVE POSITIVELY.  
LIVE POSITIVELY is a way for us to think holistically and globally about sustainability efforts throughout the Coca‑Cola system.  It is a modern expression of our Company is heritage of caring about our people and our planet.  LIVE POSITIVELY includes goals,  metrics and principles for our work in developing beverage benefits; supporting active healthy living programs; building sustainable communities; improving environmental programs for our operations; and creating a safe,  inclusive work environment for our associates.  Ultimately,  LIVE POSITIVELY is about all of us making the right decisions each day—the smart decisions—to be the Company we know we can be.  It is about continuing to challenge ourselves to improve and do more.  We discuss LIVE POSITIVELY in more detail throughout this report.  Transparency  Commitment is meaningless without accountability.  The scrutiny we face from a global audience is high,  and the need for increased transparency continues to grow beyond the requests of our critics to those of our customers and partners.  We value an open and honest dialogue with our stakeholders,  and we are prepared to advance the conversation.  
In this report,  you will see global targets for water stewardship,  climate protection,  sustainable packaging,  active healthy living and the expansion of our MDCs in Africa,  as well as increased data disclosure.  Though we highlight accomplishments,  we also note areas where we need to improve.  We provide a four-year look at performance data for the Company and the Coca‑Cola system,  where available.  And later this year,  we are publishing our Company is first full report against the Global Reporting Initiative G3 Guidelines.  We are making progress.  In fact,  in 2009 our Company was placed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time,  after being on the North America Index since 2005.  We joined some of our bottling partners who also are on the World list and respective geography lists.  This report was developed to share our commitments and our progress in meeting them,  and it is one chapter in an ongoing story.  We have accomplished many good things,  but we still have work to do to continue earning your trust and keeping our promises to you and the communities we serve.  We are dedicated to upholding those promises every day.  My best regards Muhtar Kent Chairman and Chief Executive Officer November 2,  2009

SWEETENER SAFETY Low- and no-calorie sweeteners provide consumers with a useful tool for controlling and maintaining their caloric intake and,  if used consistently along with a sensible balanced diet and regular physical activity,  their weight.  All of the sweeteners used in our products meet strict regulatory standards.  Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K or acesulfame K) is used in approximately 90 countries,  including AustraliaCanada,  most of Europe,  Japan and the United States.  Aspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched food ingredients in use today.  In addition to approval from the European Food Safety Authority and the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)regulatory agencies in more than 100 countries regard aspartame as safe.  Cyclamate is approximately 30 times as sweet as sucrose.  Although cyclamate was banned by the FDA in 1969,  since then,  more than 75 scientific studies have proven it to be safe for human consumption.  Independent scientists of the World Health Organization is Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives have consistently affirmed the safety of cyclamate for use as a sweetener in foods and beverages,  as have regulatory agencies in AustraliaEurope and many other countries.  As a resultcyclamate is now permitted for use in more than 50 countries around the world.  Rebiana is a natural,  zero-calorie sweetener that is 200 times sweeter than sugar.  It comes from the stevia leaf.  Rebiana has been determined to be Generally Recognized as Safe in the United States.  Approvals have been granted or are in process in other countries.  Saccharin has been a calorie-free sweetener for foods and beverages for more than a century.  Saccharin is permitted for use in foods and beverages in more than 100 countries around the world.  Sucralose is structurally similar to sugar but is 600 times sweeter.  It is permitted for use in foods and beverages in more than 40 countries,  including Australia,  Canada,  Mexico and the United States.  
Validation of our product safety and quality practices is provided by our product testing laboratories using state-of-the-art tools applied to ingredients,  packaging materials and products.  We measure key product and package quality attributes to ensure that our beverage products in the marketplace meet Company requirements and consumer expectations.  
In 2008,  we maintained our Company Global Product Quality Index rating of 945,  our highest-ever value.  
Regular physical activity is essential to achieving an active healthy lifestyle.  The Coca‑Cola system has launched more than 120 physical activity programs in more than 85 countries,  touching millions of people of different ages.  In 2008,  we set a goal to have at least one physical activity program in every country where we operate by 2015.  
In Latin America,  we partner with various countries' Ministries of Education to sponsor 'Apúntate a Jugar®" (translated as 'Sign Up to Play"),  a program that promotes physical activity and health and wellness education in schools.  To date,  the program is in approximately 240 schools and reaches thousands of students.  The program has its own branding and follows our school beverage program and Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy.

The Coca-Cola system cares about the health and well-being of its consumers.  We create affordable products with safequality ingredients and fact-based ingredient and nutrition information to suit a range of lifestyles,  life stages and occasions.  Our products provide people with refreshmentenjoyment,  nutrition and hydration.  Our range of full-,  reduced-,  low- and nocalorie products,  and portion sizes,  enables consumers to choose products that meet individual energy and nutritional needs.  We aspire to help people around the world lead active healthy lives through the variety and availability of the beverages we produce; our assortment of package sizes; the ingredient,  nutrition and health information we provide; our responsible marketing practices; and our support for physical activity programs.  We also support health and wellness education programs in certain countries around the world to help empower consumers to achieve active healthy lifestyles.  In some markets,  our products are criticized for their ingredients and even blamed for causing overweight and obesity.  People consume many different foods and beverages,  so no single ingredient,  food or beverage alone is responsible for overweight or obesity.  But all calories count,  including those from our beverages.  We subscribe 
to the nutrition principle that all foods and beverages can be part of a balancedsensible diet,  combined with regular physical activity.  An individual is overall diet should fulfill his or her nutrient needs without exceeding the calories they require and expend every day.  We provide product and package variety across our markets.  We have more than 750 low- and no-calorie beverages in our portfolio,  and we continue to introduce new low- and no-calorie options,  as well as nutritionally fortified products,  each year.  We also have package sizes ranging from single-serve cans to resealable large bottles,  so consumers can manage their portions and choices.  
An adequate intake of energy and nutrients is essential to an active healthy lifestyle.

ACTIVE HEALTHY LIVING 
Consumer Education and Marketing We have a responsibility to inform our consumers with fact-based ingredient and nutrition information for our products so they can make beverage choices that are in line with a sensible,  balanced diet and active lifestyle.  We also have a responsibility to respect and support our consumers and communities with advertising and marketing that is tasteful,  truthful and responsible.  Fact-based nutrition information,  in conjunction with effective consumer education,  is essential in helping consumers meet their individual nutritional needsincluding appropriate energy requirements.  In addition to the basic nutrition information we provide on our product labels,  we have made a global commitment to provide frontof-packaging (FOP) energy information (per serving) and,  where allowed by applicable regulations,  percent Daily Guidance Indicators (DGIs) on nearly all of our packaging by the end of 2011.  Consumers have told us they want more nutrition information in an easy-to-readat-a-glance format.  Our new FOP energy and percent DGIs labeling—which places the quantities of select nutrients in the context of population-based dietary guidance— commitment will enable us to provide more nutrition information to consumers.  We are 
14	 The Coca-Cola Company 
already meeting this commitment in Australia with Daily Intake labeling and in Europe with Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) labeling.  In the United States,  where percent Daily Value labeling has been in place since 1993,  we are introducing FOP calorie labeling on all products.  Similar actions are under way in Latin America.  In addition to these effortswebsites across the Coca-Cola system provide nutrition and ingredient information about the products sold in individual markets.  RESPONSIBLE MARKETING The Coca-Cola Company has policies and practices in place regarding marketing our beverages in a responsible manner.  We are committed to creating accurate,  age-appropriate advertising.  We led the global beverage industry in adopting a global Advertising and Marketing to Children Policy,  communicating our marketing guidelines and our respect for the role of parents in choosing beverage options for their children.  We do not directly target children under the age of 12 in our marketing messages in our advertising,  and we do not show children drinking any of our products outside of the presence of a parent or caregiver.  This policy has been our guiding principle in North America with regard to sparkling soft drinks for more than 50 years.

GLOBAL NUTRITION LABELING POLICY In addition to basic nutrition information,  our global policy on nutrition labeling and nutrition information also requires a statement of the amount of energy (per serving) as kilocalories,  calories or kilojoules on the front of nearly all packages.  Where permitted by applicable regulations,  we provide percent DGIs on our labels that place the quantities of energy and select nutrients,  per servingwithin the context of population-based dietary guidance.  We expect to have this labeling in place across the Coca‑Cola system for nearly all of our products by the end of 2011.  Such labeling is already in place in Australia and Europe and is currently being implemented in Mexico,  the United States and other countries.  
We provide nutrition information on nearly all product labels,  with the exception of certain returnable bottles,  fountain beverages and waters (unsweetenedunflavored).  For these beverage and packaging types,  nutrition information is provided by alternate means through our Company and Coca-Cola system websites and consumer hotlines to guide consumers to additional information.  
CLIMATE TARGETS In 2008,  working with World Wildlife Fund (WWF)—the global conservation organization—we announced global targets through 2015 for our energy management and climate protection compared with 2004 baselines.  The Coca‑Cola system set goals to:  Grow our business but not our systemwide carbon

ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND CLIMATE PROTECTION 
Managing Our Carbon Footprint As a system,  we believe that climate change can impact the sustainability of our businessand we are diligently working to minimize the environmental impact of our products and operations.  We realize that accurate accounting of our carbon emissions is imperative to implementing effective emissions reduction strategies.  We have a good understanding of the main elements of the carbon emissions from our Company and bottling partners.  While we are taking action to reduce our emissions,  we also are working to evaluate the total emission of greenhouse gases from our products across their lifecycle—from the growing of key ingredients and the production of raw materials used in manufacturing to packaging disposal and recycling once our products are consumed.  
In Japan,  we launched Georgia® Green Planet Café Au Lait.  For every bottle sold,  1 kilogram of CO2 emissions credits is purchasedoffsetting an estimated 2900 tons of CO2 emissions in Japan in 2009.  In 2007,  the Coca‑Cola system began a partnership with The Carbon Trust in the United Kingdom to calculate and publish the carbon emissions from some of our most popular beverages—Coca‑ColaCoca‑Cola light® and Coca‑Cola Zero™.  This is the first time that the footprint of any sparkling beverage has been certified by The Carbon Trust.  We plan to further explore this process and use the methodology to offer insights and guidance to our operations in other countries.

Throughout the Coca-Cola system,  we are creating enhancements in bottling and manufacturing operations,  adding more fuel-efficient modes of transportation to our distribution fleet,  and upgrading cooling and vending equipment to reduce HFCs from our emission profile.  In our manufacturing operations and office facilities,  our improvements range from fixing leaks,  insulating pipes and putting in efficient lighting to installing renewable and biodiesel energy sources.  In 2009,  our Company office in Belgium made significant lighting,  heating and cooling efficiency upgrades and switched to 100 percent renewable energy,  reducing its ecological footprint by more than 25 percent.  Fuel and emission reduction efforts for our delivery fleet continue to grow.  In Uruguaywe are using 30 compact,  electric-powered trucks to efficiently and conveniently deliver our products to smaller retail locations in congested areas while reducing emissions.  This new model averages one-fifth the fuel consumption of the earlier model.  
Our production facility in Chaudfontaine,  Belgium,  is using geothermal energy to heat its buildings,  reducing energy use by 11 percent.  
In Mexico,  the Coca‑Cola system introduced new diesel-electric delivery trucks to its distribution fleet.  The new trucks are 30 percent more fuel efficient and reduce CO2 emissions by 40 percent.  Throughout 2009,  the Company is updating all of its 85 diesel fuel delivery trucks in New Delhi,  India,  to be powered by compressed natural gas.  CCE,  our largest bottling partner,  will add an additional 186 diesel-electric delivery trucks to its fleet in 2009,  bringing its total fleet to 328 trucks in the United States and Canada.  This will create the largest heavy-duty hybrid electric delivery fleet in North America.  The Coca‑Cola system continues to make progress toward our commitment to improve the energy efficiency of our cooling equipment by 40–50 percent by the end of 2010.  We developed a proprietary energy management system that delivers energy savings of up to 35 percent.  We have placed 16 million of these units in markets around the world.  We also have transitioned to HFC-free insulation foam for all new equipment,  eliminating approximately 75 percent of direct greenhouse gas emissions.  And we intend to add 100000 HFC‑free coolers by the end of 2010.  We have installed 39000 of these HFC-free coolers in the marketplace to date.

" President Bill Clinton  Founder,  William J.  Clinton Foundation,  and Founding Chairman,  Clinton Global Initiative 
Our unique distribution model allows the Coca‑Cola system to build relationships with small enterprises,  creating economic opportunity and wealth creation at the community level in developing markets.  These micro distribution businessescommonly known as Manual Distribution Centers (MDCs),  are run by local small-scale entrepreneurs who employ local workers to deliver our products to small retailers in their neighborhoods.  They typically reach consumers in dense urban areas in the developing world where traditional truck delivery is not feasible.  Scaling up this model is our commitment to the Business Call to Action,  an initiative being led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),  which calls on companies to identify ways that they can help accelerate progress toward the MDGs.  By 2010,  we have committed to forming 1300 to 2000 new MDCs,  which will create 5300 to 8400 new jobs.  As we scale up,  we also are committed to enhancing the positive development impacts of the MDCs.  Harvard University and the International Finance Corporation recently studied a group of MDCs in Kenya and Tanzania to help us identify ways we can maximize MDC development impacts while preserving their core business value.

SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING 
Our Sustainable Packaging Vision The value of packaging is often seen as a paradox.  Packaging plays an essential role in meeting consumer needs and preventing waste by effectively protecting products during delivery.  However,  once emptiedmany consider packaging to be a wasteful and burdensome problem.  We are actively working throughout the Coca‑Cola system to create solutions by advancing a global sustainable packaging strategy aimed at preventing waste over the life of our packaging.  To us,  waste prevention extends beyond simply reducing packaging material.  Our focus is on eliminating all raw materialenergy and water losses across the entire packaging process chain—from the initial resources used to make a package through to the consumer and beyond.  At the foundation of our strategy is a commitment to measuring performance and using sound science to drive continuous improvement.  For the past five years,  we have worked to create a systemwide tracking tool to enable us to better monitor,  measure and share our global packaging use and innovations.  We also have continued to build on our 40‑year legacy of using lifecycle assessment research for guiding decisions and setting performance targets.  
Today our packaging goals focus on four priority areas for effectively preventing waste: optimizing packaging efficiency; increasing renewable resource use; recovering packages for reuse; and increasing recycled material use.

We focus the majority of our material reduction innovations on the packaging we use most—PET,  glass,  aluminum and fountain.  In China,  the rollout of our new short-height bottle cap for most of our sparkling and still beverages is expected to eliminate the equivalent plastic use of 439 million caps and 208 million 500‑mL bottles.  In Latin America and Europe,  we reduced the weight of our 2-liter contour bottle by 75 percent,  which will save 16000 metric tons of plastic annually.  Fountain beverages—one of our oldest and most efficient package delivery systems— account for 12 percent of our global unit case volume.

PLANTBOTTLE ™ We recently announced our development of plantbottle,  a new,  redesigned PET plastic bottle made from a blend of petrochemical-based materials and up to 30 percent plant-basedrenewable materials.  The bottle is 100 percent recyclable in the existing PET plastic stream and has a lower reliance on nonrenewable resources compared with fully petrochemical-based PET plastic bottles.  The bottle will be piloted with Dasani® and certain sparkling brands in 2009.  We also are exploring the use of other sustainable plant by‑products for future generations of our packaging.

Recovery and Reuse Efforts 'By carefully examining the environmental impacts of their products and packaging throughout their lifecycle,  and assessing the end-of-life options,  Coca-Cola has laid out a strategy that takes packaging decisions to a more comprehensive and dynamic level. " Kate Krebs  Director,  Sustainable Resources,  The Climate Group 
Approximately 85 percent of our global beverage volume is delivered in recyclable bottles and cans.  To realize our long-term sustainability aspirations,  the recovery of these containers and their materials for reuse is critical.  We are committed to increasing the collection of bottles and cans for recycling in the communities we serve.  Last year,  our system contributed hundreds of millions of dollars toward initiatives that collected or recovered more than 35 percent of the equivalent bottles and cans we sold worldwide.  Our goal is to increase this recovery to 50 percent by 2015.  In order to do so,  our focus is primarily on advancing four core packaging recovery models: comprehensive product stewardship programs in developed markets; recycling cooperative programs in developing and emerging markets; voluntary deposits on refillable packages in least-developed markets; and Coca-Cola-operated recycling enterprises globally.  We also continue to sponsor litter prevention and community beautification initiatives to protect waterways,  ocean shores and other areas.  A key to driving recovery is ensuring that market demand for collected materials is strong.  The Coca‑Cola system helps foster this demand by advancing sustainable technologies that enable greater use of recycled content material in our packaging; 
purchasing products made from recycled beverage packaging; and enhancing the efficiency of our refillable bottles.  Since the late 1970s,  we have dedicated significant resources toward enhancing the environmental performance and costcompetitiveness of recycling plastic bottles into new bottles.  We have funded plastic recycling technology development for decades and have direct investment in six bottle-to-bottle recycling plants,  including the world is largest in Spartanburg,  South Carolina.  Our system currently uses recycled PET in approximately 20 countries.  Thanks to technology advances,  using recycled PET content can reduce energy use by more than 70 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 percent compared with using virgin PET.  Today,  the Coca‑Cola system uses up to 50 percent recycled content in individual bottles,  but extending beyond this has shown diminishing environmental returns given inefficiencies with current recycling technology.  We are working to overcome these limitations and increase our overall use of recycled PET content,  as we have done since launching the first-ever bottle with recycled content in 1991.

WATER TARGETS We have set two water targets for the Coca‑Cola system:  Through our conservation partnership with WWF,  improve 
our water efficiency by 20 percent by 2012,  compared with a 2004 baseline  Return to the environment,  at a level that supports aquatic life,  the water we use in our system operations by the end of 2010 through comprehensive wastewater treatment 
In India,  our goal is to be a  net zero" user of groundwater by the end of 2009 by recharging the amount of groundwater used in our operations through supporting hundreds of rainwater harvesting projects.  We also support drip irrigation and other initiatives like this step well in Jaipur.  To learn more about our progress in India,  visit www, coca-colaindia, com.  
WATER STEWARDSHIP 
Our Water Stewardship 'In this resource-constrained world,  successful businesses will find ways to achieve growth while using fewer resources.  The Coca‑Cola Company is commitment to conservation responds to the imperative to solve the global water and climate crisis. " Carter Roberts  President and CEO,  World Wildlife Fund 
Water is vital to our business.  It is the primary ingredient in our products and is used in our manufacturing process.  Water also is vital to sustaining every community in the world.  Our goal is to safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equivalent to what we use in all of our products and their production.  Throughout our operations,  we adhere to rigorous quality standards that cover both source water and finished products.  
In 2007,  The Coca‑Cola Company became one of the first six companies to commit to the CEO Water Mandate,  a program designed to help companies better manage water use in their direct operations and throughout their supply chains.  The guidelines of this mandate help frame the content of our water stewardship reporting.  
We practice our water stewardship in three areas: reduce our water use ratio (efficiency) while growing our unit case volume; recycle the water used in our operations (wastewater treatment); and replenish the water we use through community water access and watershed restoration and protection.  Throughout the Coca‑Cola system,  we are intensely focused on water stewardshipand we have established partnerships with governments,  NGOs and communities to help us progress in each area.  
Water will always be important to our Company,  and we are continually working to reduce our impact and minimize our use.  We have a special responsibility with regard to replenishing water in areas of the world under water stress.  And we focus much of our replenishing work in communities where the needs are greatest.  
COCA-COLA SYSTEM WATER USE RATIO (EFFICIENCY) FROM 2004 TO 2008 
In Mexico and Brazil,  we partner with local governments and NGOs to reforest more than 30000 hectares1 of ecosystems to nurture and protect local watersheds.  1

WATER STEWARDSHIP 
Recycling Water in Our System While we work to improve our water efficiency for each liter of product we produce,  we also recycle the water we use in our operations.  Our goal is to return all the water we use in our manufacturing processes to the environment at a level that supports aquatic life,  throughout the Coca‑Cola system,  by the end of 2010.  Typically referred to as 'wastewater, " water used in our system operations is recycled through a treatment and cleansing process.  This ensures that the quality of the wastewater meets or exceeds applicable laws and regulations before being released back into the environment.  Treated wastewater also is sometimes used within our plants for utility purposes in boilers,  evaporators and chillers and outside for landscape irrigation and dust control,  reducing our use of external water sources.  We have stringent wastewater treatment standards in place for our Company,  which our bottling partners are required to adopt by the end of 2010.  They establish wastewater treatment standards in communities where such standards do not exist and,  in some communities,  exceed the standards of applicable laws and regulations.  We are working with our bottling partners to ensure all system operations are aligned and we are on target to reach our 2010 wastewater treatment goal.  32	 The Coca-Cola Company 
Our bottling partners build their own on-site wastewater treatment systems where needed.  This is an expensive and time-consuming activity,  but we believe alignment with our global standards is critical to help preserve local water resources.  In 2008,  88 percent of our facilities were in compliance with our internal wastewater treatment standards.  
In 2008,  our Company discharged a total of 184 billion liters of wastewater,  a 3 percent increase over 2007 while unit case volume grew 5 percent.  2008 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE LIMITS 1 (mg/L  milligrams per liter) Maximum Concentration (unless local limits are lower) 5-Day Biological Oxygen Demand pH Level Total Suspended Solids Total Dissolved Solids

Water Beyond Our Operations 'It is a great honor to name The Coca‑Cola Company as the 25th recipient of the prestigious Gold Medal Award.  The company is outstanding contributions in providing safe water for communities around the world set the standard for others to follow. " Dr.  Joel Abrams  World Environment Center Gold Medal Jury Chairman 
Water is a resource under great pressure globally.  Population growth,  climate change and global development will increase pressure on freshwater resources.  Ingredients that rely on or impact freshwater resources may be challenged if effective use and replenishment practices are not in place.  As we prepare our business for the futurewe are working to sustain the availability of water for our products and communities.  Systemwide,  our beverages are produced locally,  and the water we use to create our beverages is sourced locally.  In all cases,  the water we use is shared with communities and nature.  In 2008,  we made a systemwide requirement that all plants assess the vulnerabilities of the quality and quantity of their water source and work with civil society and governments to implement a source water protection plan by 2013.  This same approach is applied when siting new plants.  We work to balance the water we use in our finished beverages by participating in locally relevant water replenishment projects that support communities and nature.  Our more than 200 community water partnerships focus on water protection,  conservation and providing access to clean water and sanitation for communities.  These projects currently span more than 60 countries and are conducted in partnership with a wide range of organizations,  including the U.S.  Agency 
for International Development,  CAREUNDP,  WWF,  and many local governmentscommunities and NGOs.  REPLENISH AFRICA INITIATIVE In 2009,  we announced our Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN)—a six-year,  $30 million commitment to provide access to safe drinking water to communities throughout Africa.  RAIN will be implemented by The Coca‑Cola Africa Foundation and will provide at least 2 million Africans with clean water and sanitation by 2015.  RAIN aims to help provide solutions to Africa is water crisis,  which currently threatens the health of the population and the prospects for economic growth.  It also is an effort to help Africa progress toward its Millennium Development Goals target for access to clean drinking water.

Managing Supplier Relationships Having a sound,  stable and ethical supply base is important for our growth and the footprint we leave in local communities around the world.  Our suppliers provide our system with materials,  including ingredientspackaging and machinery,  as well as goods and services.  As a company,  we have a responsibility to hold our direct suppliers and bottling partners to standards commensurate with our own operations.  We also have an opportunity to support community development by purchasing goods and services from minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs).  Our suppliers are expected,  at a minimumto conduct business in an ethical manner and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.  Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) communicate our values and expectations for our bottling partners and business partners.  The SGPs are a part of all supplier agreements,  and a pre-certification system is in place for trademark marketing suppliers.  Suppliers also are provided training and assistance programs on an as-needed basis for areas where they need to improve their operations.  As a part of our SGPs,  we perform routine supplier audits.  If we find that a supplier fails to uphold any aspect of our SGPs,  the supplier is expected to implement corrective actions or risk contract termination.  In 2008 we conducted 1898 supplier auditsa 45 percent increase over 2007.  Just as diversity is essential in our workplaceit also is important in our supplier base.  Supplier diversity helps create long-term growth and competitive advantage for our Company.  We seek procurement opportunities and build relationships with MWBEs as suppliers,  contractors and subcontractors of goods and services.  Since 2000,  we have tracked and grown our spending with MWBEs.  In 2008,  we spent $413 million with first- and second-tier MWBEs,  a 13 percent increase over 2007.  CHILD LABOR We are taking steps to address child labor in sugarcane harvesting because we are a significant buyer of sugar worldwide.  We recently hosted two convenings of experts on this topic to seek advice on the most constructive role that we can play in addressing this complex issue.  These convenings included representatives of the U.S.  Departments of State and Labor,  the International Labour OrganizationSave the Children,  CARE and socially responsible investors.  As a result of these discussions,  we developed an action plan focused on raising awareness at the international level and taking concrete actions at the country level in collaboration with our suppliers,  local government and industries to address child labor in sugarcane harvesting.
