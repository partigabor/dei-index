Indra Nooyi Q&A What does sustainability mean at PepsiCo? We define sustainability as 'Performance with Purpose. " In today is world,  consumers are bringing their principles to their purchasing.  We,  in return,  are bringing a purpose to our performance.  There are three specific components to Performance with Purpose.  First,  we offer foods and beverages that responsibly provide nourishment to people and societies.  Second,  we are intent on minimizing our impact on the environment in which we operate.  And third,  we work hard to create a safe,  healthy and inclusive environment where the best people want to work.  
How does the Performance with Purpose mission tie in with our business? Performance with Purpose is at the foundation of every aspect of our business.  Indeed,  financial achievement can and must go hand-in-hand with sustainability.  Our approach to creating superior financial performance is straightforward  drive shareholder value.  We integrate a commitment to human,  environmental and talent performance into all of our operations.

How is PepsiCo responding to these difficult economic times? There is no question that these are challenging times.  Like many companies,  we are facing headwinds such as rising costs,  an uncertain economic outlook and shifting currency rates.  While we can't control the macroeconomic system,  we need to adapt to the nearterm challenges to deliver our long-term growth plans.  We are taking measured steps to continue generating long-term shareholder value.  First,  we are focusing on consumer value as much as innovation and premium products.  Second,  we are calibrating consumer price points and packaging options to keep our products in proportion with the rest of the food basket and to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and wallet constraints.  And finally,  we are investing where we believe we have the greatest leverage to maintain and ultimately accelerate our growth.  
What is PepsiCo doing to tackle consumer health concerns like obesity? Obesity impacts quality of life and poses a serious health risk.  More than one billion adults are overweight and 300 million are clinically obese  in both developed and developing countries.  We recognize our responsibility to address diet and nutrition concerns around the globe.  We are mindful of the way the world is changing and we are listening to experts who provide deep insights and enabling solutions.  As a result,  we have made steady progress transforming our portfolio,  for example,  by introducing new products that offer improved nutrition.  We are reducing portion sizes and reformulating some 
of our existing products to reduce fat,  saturated fat,  salt and sugar.  We are also adding more whole grains,  fiberfruits and vegetables and vitamins and minerals to our products.  We agree with the World Health Organizationthe National Institutes of Health and other leading experts that the ultimate solution to obesity is energy balance  the balance between calories consumed and calories burned through activity.  We are committed to supporting both sides of this energy balance equation.  
Water is a key ingredient in many PepsiCo products.  How is the company addressing water issues? We are working hard to reduce the amount of water we use to make our products.  We are also promoting access to clean water around the world through alliances with non-profit groups and working with agricultural suppliers to assist them with efficiency improvements.  Our efforts are focused where our assets and expertise can make the biggest impact.  One such area is farming.  On average,  agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all fresh water use in the world and as much as 95 percent in many developing countries  almost all goes to irrigating crops.  Changing the way that farmers use water in some of the fastest growing economies will help address water scarcity.  In India,  for example,  PepsiCo is working with farmers to save approximately 30 percent of the water they typically use for growing rice.  We have introduced a unique form of direct seeding and paddy cultivation.  In China,  PepsiCo developed a low water use way to grow potatoes under desert conditions by using a pivot irrigation system.  In all markets  but especially 
those that are growing rapidly  applying innovation and developing new methods for conserving water is vital to our business.  
How can the food and beverage industry make the biggest difference in terms of addressing environmental sustainability? PepsiCo has focused on three environmental areas that are critical to the industry: water,  energy and packaging.  We are continually looking for ways to bring to scale the good ideas being implemented across our business and we share this experience with our peers.  Our goal is continuous improvement,  driven by the ingenuity of our people,  best practices,  technology,  education,  and innovation.  We have always been an environmentally concerned company.  In recent years,  we have stepped up our initiatives.  Now that we have common environmental metrics across all PepsiCo divisions globally,  we can better track,  manage and understand our environmental footprint.  I'm certain this will lead to continuous progress.

Risk Management PepsiCo is subject to risks in the normal course of business.  These risks include: product demand; our reputation; information technology; supply chain; retail consolidation; the loss of major customers and failure to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners; global,  economic,  environmental and political conditions; the regulatory environment; workforce retention and outsourcing; raw materials and other supplies; competition; and market risks.  In 2007,  we continued to focus our risk mitigation efforts to further reduce PepsiCo is exposure to risks,  and integrated those efforts in our businesses' operating plans and budgets,  where accountability is assigned and performance measured.  Risk Management Process Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  As suchwe leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify,  assess,  prioritize,  manage,  monitor and communicate risks across the Company.  This framework includes: 	 The PepsiCo Executive Council (PEC),  comprised of a cross-functional,  geographically diverse,  senior management group which identifies,  assesses,  prioritizes and addresses strategic and reputational risks; 	 Division Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of crossfunctional senior management teams which meet regularly each year to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address divisionspecific operating risks; 	 PepsiCo is Risk Management Office,  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools and analytical support to the PEC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and 
19	 2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 
facilitates ongoing communication between the partiesas well as to PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors; 	 PepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and 	 PepsiCo is Compliance Office,  which leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices.  Risk Identification This takes place annually from both a top-down (PEC) and bottom-up (DRC) viewpoint.  Our risk identification efforts seek to evaluate both external risks (customer trends,  consumer trends,  government and public policy risks),  as well as risks associated with internal capabilities.  
Risk Assessment After identifying our most significant inherent risks,  each assessing body (PEC,  DRCs,  Risk Management Office RMO) reviews the most significant risks from both a probability,  impact and vulnerability perspective at two levels inherent and residual.  This assessment requires that we fully understand the existing capabilities,  controlsprograms,  insurance coverage and other mitigating factors that enable an accurate assessment of the risk.  Risk Prioritization After assessment,  all risks that exceed a predetermined threshold are prioritized by both assessment itself as well as the ability to influence and/or mitigate.  In additionthe RMO aggregates the risk assessment information to look for risk interdependencies and common mitigation solutions.  Risk Response Following our prioritization of risks,  the PEC and DRCs are required to explicitly determine the response to each significant risk.  The responses include accepting avoiding,  mitigating and transferring (via third party insurance).  The DRCs also identify which risks will be monitored on an ongoing basis and what measurement index will be used for such a purpose.  Communication Each DRC is required to summarize its risk management efforts by providing meeting minutes,  as well as semiannual submissions of risk maps.  Risk maps are used to document specific information about identified risksincluding the likelihood,  the impact and risk response.  For PepsiCo is top risks,  PepsiCo has assigned Executive Risk Owners responsible for understanding the risk across the Company and providing annual updates to the PEC as well as the Audit Committee and Board of Directors,  depending upon the risk area.  A semi-annual risk management update is provided to the PepsiCo Audit Committee,  during which our risk profilerisk mitigation efforts and risk management process are discussed.

Our Environmental Policy PepsiCo is Environmental Policy applies to all our operations.  PepsiCo monitors company-owned operations and joint ventures where we hold a majority share.  We encourage our suppliers,  service providersbottlers and other partners to adhere to the policy.  
Education and Awareness – Engaging Employees We are committed to educating our associates on the importance of environmental sustainability.  In addition to regular training of environmental personnel,  we conduct special events,  such as a Sustainability Summit,  in which new ideas are shared.  In May 2008,  PepsiCo introduced the Sustainable Engineering Guidelines,  which are meant to support overall implementation of our environmental sustainability concept throughout the engineering process and to improve efficiency in the use of natural resources.  The Sustainable Engineering Guidelines can be accessed through a website available to all PepsiCo 
employees and key partners worldwide.  We also offer workshops on RECON,  our global ecoefficiency strategy for resource conservation within our operations to our engineers,  as well as to bottlers and co-packers around the world.  In 2008,  U.S.  employees were offered Chronosan e-learning tutorial designed to help associates understand the landscape of sustainability and the business case for sustainable development.  It was created through a partnership with the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the 
University of Cambridge,  UK.  Environmental sustainability is shared with all our associates through holding special activities to mark events such as Earth Day and World Water Week.  Environmental information is also included in our daily e-newsletter.  Our Latin America Beverages business has a bi-monthly employee e-newsletter dedicated to sharing environmental sustainability initiatives and projects in the region as well as showcasing best practices.  Green Teams Green Teams Frito-Lay North America maintains a dedicated team of experts across our manufacturing facilities focused on reducing consumption of electricityfuels and water.  Through 'Green Teams, " made up of groups of volunteer employees,  more than 12000 manufacturing associates have been trained to improve their environmental awareness and to understand how they can do their jobs without adversely impacting the environment.  Quaker,  Tropicana,  and Gatorade have established 'QTG Green, " an over-arching environmental sustainability initiative to raise employee awareness and create actionable tactics to improve the business and each associate is personal environmental footprint.  The focus is to raise awareness,  incite action and institutionalize sustainability improvement.  
Water Water is essential for all foods: for growing,  washingprocessing and cooking.  It is the primary ingredient in our beverages.  Reducing the amount of water we use is imperative and we are committed to minimizing our water footprint through greater efficiency across our operations.  Where we source our water is just as critical since sourcing from stressed areas causes damage to 
local communities and eco-systems.  Throughout our business,  we work to reduce our water footprint and help avoid water conflicts with local communities.  At the same time,  we are engaged in improving access to clean water around the world through alliances with non-profit groups.  
the worst in centuries.  Those solutions alone helped the Atlanta plant conserve nearly 290 million liters of water in 2007 and have led to system-wide water savings.  Since 2004,  Gatorade has reduced water usage by 17 percent across its entire manufacturing system through implementing best practices across facilities.  Gatorade 
Conserving Water in Our Operations In 2007,  we saved nearly 5 billion liters of water across our operations as compared to 2006 through technological improvements in our global manufacturing operations and resource conservation programs.  In the United Kingdom,  our total water use across all our operations was 1564 million liters in 2007.  Between 2001 and 2007,  we reduced the water used to manufacture Walkers Crisps by 42 percent from 13l/kg of production to 76l/kg.  This was achieved through a comprehensive analysis of all water usage and improved measurement systems.  The Walkers team developed engineering solutions to reduce equipment water use and increase opportunities for recycled water use.  Training and communication sessions were held for all employees to drive awareness of the need to reduce water use and how they could play a part.  Performance was tracked between lines and shifts,  with the best performing teams being rewarded and recognized.  None of our facilities in the United Kingdom and Ireland is in a region that the Environment Agency identifies as under  iserious water stress. " Gatorade Employees as Change Agents Many water efficiency solutions implemented across our global operations today were first identified by the conservation team at our Gatorade facility in AtlantaGeorgia in response to the August 2007 drought,  one of 
employees on the manufacturing line have acted as change agents by helping plants conserve millions of liters of water.  Through employee-led 'tag and flag" programs,  water savings efficiencies such as leaks on production lines are immediately addressed.  
	2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 2 	5 
Gatorade is continuing to implement innovative technologies throughout its plants,  including: 	 Using dry lube,  a process that replaces soapy water with silicone to lubricate bottle lines 	 Reclaiming and recycling steam vapor from heating processes 	 Cleaning empty bottles through 'air-rinsing, " a process that uses ionized air instead of water 
In Mexico,  all of our Sabritas manufacturing facilities have secondary process water treatment systems,  which will allow us to extend water recycling to more activities while eliminating the impact of waste water on the environment.  Frito-Lay,  the US snack division of PepsiCo,  continued to improve its water efficiency by conserving more than 300 million gallons (1 billion liters) of water in 2007 as compared to 2006; through its continued water conservation efforts known as the 'Gallon per Pound Challenge, " Frito-Lay won recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency as a Water Efficiency Leader in 2007.  Efficiency methods include recovering the water used in making potato chips to wash away the starch that comes from the potato slices.  Once the starch is removed,  the water is cleaned and recycled for use in processing operations.  At Pepsi-Cola North America,  concentrate produced by PepsiCo Concentrate Operations is sold to independent bottling companies,  which finish mixing the productbottle it and sell it to retailers.  PepsiCo helps guide and monitor the bottler companies' environmental performance.  The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) has installed reverse osmosis (RO) recovery systems or incorporated high recovery designs into their new installations that cumulatively save more than I billion liters of water annually as compared to traditional designs.  Pepsi Bottling Ventures (PBV),  another anchor bottler,  saved more than 30 million liters of water in 2007 through conservation efforts and more than more than 11 million liters of water in production operations through water reuse and process improvements since 2005.  Water conservation is especially important in water stressed areas.  In 2003,  our India team embarked on an ambitious journey to achieve positive water balance by 2009 through a comprehensive program to conserve and 
26	 2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 
optimize water usage,  both in our own manufacturing processes and in the communities we serve.  We have carried out a variety of innovative reuse and recycling initiatives.  In the last five years in India,  we have reduced our water use in manufacturing by more than 55 percent.  In just the last three years,  we have saved more than 25 billion liters of water through water conservation efforts in manufacturing plants.  We have also prevented depletion of ground water aquifers by constructing rainwater harvesting systems in most of our plants.  We have supplemented this by introducing community water projects in farms and comprehensive watershed management programs in diverse and challenging geographic locations.  Similar projects are underway in China,  Thailand and Mexico.  Reducing Water Use in Agriculture While using water responsibly throughout our business is a top priority,  we also believe in our ability to address the broader problem of water scarcity.  In India,  for example,  where reducing Water Use in Agriculture in India accounts for over 80 percent of total fresh water consumption,  PepsiCo is working with farmers to reduce water intensity in paddy cultivation by around 30 percent through direct seeding of paddy that avoids the traditional flood irrigation method currently practiced by paddy growers across the country.  Paddy is India is largest grain crop,  and consumes the bulk of fresh water used in Indian agriculture.  In 2007,  PepsiCo piloted this program on 100 acres,  and this was scaled up to cover 1000 acres in 2008.  The significant impact of this change can be gauged from the fact that if only 6000 acres of paddy cultivation were shifted to direct seedingit would offset the entire water used in PepsiCo India is beverage plants.  
Partnering for Change PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi publicly demonstrated PepsiCo is commitment to helping address the global water crisis by joining other partners as a signatory to the United Nations CEO Water Mandate.  By signing the CEO Water Mandate,  PepsiCo has committed to adhere to a holistic approach to water management in six areas: direct operations,  supply chain and watershed management,  collective action,  public policy,  community engagement and transparency.  Ethos Water In 2007,  as in previous years,  we were active supporters of World Water Day.  Our most visible activity was with Ethos Water,  which is a part of the PepsiCo water family.  In 2006,  Starbucks Coffee Company and 
PepsiCo,  through our North American Coffee Partnershipsigned an agreement to significantly increase distribution of Ethos Water,  including co-packing,  distribution and marketing.  Ethos Water has a unique business modelwhich includes helping to raise awareness of the severity of the world water crisis.  For each bottle of Ethos Water sold,  Starbucks makes a $005 donation to water projects with the goal of contributing $10 million by the end of 2010 to help children and their communities around the world get access to clean drinking water.  
In India,  we have a partnership with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) for research and implementation to ensure long-term availability of water resources through interventions aimed at eco restoration through catchment treatment measures,  artificial groundwater recharge and demand management measures and improvement in the quality of life of the community by undertaking interventions in areas of water supply,  sanitation,  hygiene,  health and education through community involvement.  
Leaving a Positive Footprint on Society 
three-year partnership.  The program includes a series of high-impact,  community-based activities and practical solutions across water,  agriculture and climate.  Water Partners: The PepsiCo Foundation made a $41 million grant to WaterPartners to provide safe drinking water and sanitation to communities of the greatest need in India.  This grant was the biggest single contribution to WaterPartner is WaterCredit Initiative,  an innovative program that uses micro-finance to increase access to safe water and improve sanitation for local communities in India.  
The PepsiCo Foundation is mission around the environment is to advance the knowledge and methods of water resource management that are sustainable and positively impact both quantity and quality of water supply.

Water Quality Our facilities in the United States are primarily supplied by municipal water sources.  As such,  these municipal water purveyors comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR),  which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with EPA quality requirements.  Our facilities in the United States are,  in essence,  consumers of this municipal drinking water just as are residential customers of the same supplies.  As such,  the quality data for the water that is purchased is available from the municipal water purveyors,  whether the purchaser is PepsiCo,  one of our franchise partners,  or a home consumer.  Similarly outside the United States,  many of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources,  and the same approach would apply  the governing national and local regulations for water resources and water quality would,  and do,  apply.  In areas of the world where we develop our own water sources (for example,  extraction from commercial wells) we do so in full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources.  In these cases,  we work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business and thereby to help support the local community and economy,  is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource.  Where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sources,  every source is tested by an approved,  external laboratory which is capable of reporting drinking water testing results.  The test protocol is based on the most current revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality,  and also includes testing required by local authorities.  
Every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified,  which includes using government-accredited/recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of roughly 100 parameterscovering many classes of raw water chemical/physical constituents.  In addition,  the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be microbial and chemically safe.  We also believe that protection of water at the source is important; accordingly,  a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel,  which covers areas such as water source selection,  well construction,  and 
source protection.  At every plant,  the incoming water is then further purified,  using a variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization,  to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products  whether these products are bottled water,  carbonated beverages,  or non-carbonated drinks.  In addition to source qualification,  our plants monitor the raw,  in-process,  and treated water for a core list of parameters,  and at frequencies ranging from hourly,  to daily,  to weekly (depending on the specific parameter and application).  We have also established internal laboratories in the United States and Europe which monitor raw,  treated,  and bottled water quality worldwide.  Water Sources For new sites,  each of our businesses applies the elements of an environmental site assessment,  similar to the EPA/ASTM Standard for Phase One Environmental Site Assessment.  With specific regard to water sources,  in the United States,  we utilize a mixture of municipal supplieswhich may be from surface or groundwater sourcesand private wells.  The selection and management of municipal sources fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and any applicable corresponding state authority.  These sources must comply with the EPA National Primary Drinking Water Regulations and any other applicable regulations and practices related to water resource selection and development (for example site selectionwell construction,  drought management plans,  and many other elements).  Sites are selected to assure ample water supply and minimal impact to the local watershed.  PepsiCo is involved as a full supporter and Advisory Board member in the development of a Water Resource Assessment Tool which has been introduced by the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),  in conjunction with a world recognized environmental consulting firm.  This tool provides an assessment of relative water availability (abundancestress,  scarcity) for any physical location coordinates entered,  in addition to a wealth of other water-related information.  This is the first comprehensive tool of its kind that was entered into the public domain completely free of charge- for use by any and all business sectorsgovernments,  NGOs,  and other stakeholders.  It was launched August 2007.  
Energy Climate change may adversely affect the raw materials and other supplies we use,  including water and agricultural products.  In 2007,  we successfully reduced our use of fuels and electricity and continued work to transform our business model,  including identifying opportunities to reduce energy use in our operations and use renewable energy,  construct green buildings and work with suppliers to reduce their energy use.  Reducing Our Energy Use We have set comprehensive electric and thermal energy reduction goals across our businesses to ensure that the energy intensity of our operations is continuously reduced.  During 2007,  our beverage businesses reduced electricity consumption by 8 percent and fuels consumption by 7 percent per unit of product.  Our foods businesses reduced electricity consumption by 3 percent and fuels consumption by 5 percent.  
Per unit of production.  Represents 95% of companyowned manufacturing facilities.  Non-manufacturing facilities not included.  In the United Kingdom and Ireland,  we reduced the amount of energy used per pack of Walkers Crisps production by 32 percent between 2000 and 2007.  We have also focused on the energy efficiency of our vehicle fleet.  In the United Kingdom and Ireland,  we improved our fleet fuel efficiency by 12 percent between 2001 and 2006.  In 2007,  we reduced our absolute distribution footprint by 43 percent despite shipping 103 percent more products.  This was achieved by vehicle technology investments including lower friction tires and streamlining to reduce wind resistance,  new journey-planning software,  and a comprehensive training program combined with an in-cab system that tracks fuel efficiency on a weekly basis.  Sabritas,  our Mexican snack food business,  has 13000 distribution vehicles,  about 6000 of which were converted over the past ten years to burn liquid propane gas.  This reduces carbon and nitrogen emissions and generates fuel savings of between 15 and 22 percent (depending on geographic conditions and fuel costs).  Frito-Lay operates one of the largest fleets in the United States and is committed to reducing GHG and fuel consumption.  Frito-Lay has placed over 3000 new Low Emission Vehicle (LEV)-certified route delivery trucks on the road since 2006,  replacing 1996 and older pre-emissions diesel models,  and has implemented several additional fuel-saving initiatives.  From 20062007,  Frito-Lay installed over 4000 auxiliary heaters and idle shutdown devices in vehicles nationally,  which saved in excess of 200000 gallons fuel and 2000 metric tonnes GHG.  Frito-Lay is heavily involved in advancing fuel-efficient fleet technology through partnerships with 
	2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 2 	9 
industry and government entities to further fuel-saving and emissions-reducing technology and real-world experience of hybrids Partners include the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality(TCEQ),  National Renewable Energy Labs (NREL),  The SouthWest Research Institute (SWRi),  the California Air Resources Board (CARB),  Purdue University,  and the American Trucking Association (ATA).  Both Frito-Lay and our bottlers use advanced routing technologies and have a  no-idle" policy to reduce miles and cut fuel consumption on delivery routes.  Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),  our largest bottler,  has verified the electronic settings on vehicles with electronic controls to ensure idling reduction and speed parameters are set efficiently.  PepsiCo and Frito Lay have joined SmartWay,  a voluntary partnership between various freight industry sectors and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that establishes incentives for fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  By 2012,  this initiative is expected to save up to 25 billion liters of fuel per year (equivalent to 150 million barrels of oil).  PepsiCo UK will save around one million food transport miles from British roads each year through an innovative partnership with retailers and suppliers.  By reviewing the activities of both supplier and retailer fleets and tracking mutual routes,  it has been possible to eliminate empty running routes for both parties saving around 700000 miles per year.  PepsiCo has also integrated two thirds of its British potato cargo into its in-house fleet and has designed a trailer that combines both finished produce and bulk raw materials,  resulting in a highly utilized fleet that can make customer deliveries en route to the farmsaving just under 300000 miles per year.

PepsiCo is commitment to saving energy through green building worldwide continued in 2007.  Our new facilities constructed in 2007 were designed to meet the U.S.  Green Building Council is (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards  one of the most rigorous standards for 'green building" in the world.  The USGBC awarded the prestigious LEED Gold certification to two of our facilities: Gatorade is WythevilleVirginia manufacturing facility and Gatorade is TollesonArizona distribution center.  At the time,  the Wytheville facility was the largest LEED-Gold certified food and beverage manufacturing site in the world.  In May 2008,  PepsiCo introduced the Sustainable Engineering Guidelines based on LEED standards. The guidelines support our environmental sustainability commitments throughout our engineering processand apply to all new construction as well as major remodels of existing buildings globally.  The Sustainable Engineering Guidelines can be accessed through a website available to all PepsiCo engineers and key partners worldwide.  The website provides guidelines for: 	 Site selection 	 Construction activity management 	 Water use reduction 	 Building materials 	 Building systems 	 Plant process management 
Refrigerants Marketing Equipment (coolers/vending machines) affects the environment through the use of electricity and refrigerants.  PepsiCo is committed to reducing the impact of our marketing equipment through design and process changes developed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Since 2004,  energy consumption has been reduced by 53 percent for coolers worldwide and 55 percent for vendors.  In 2006,  PepsiCo joined other companies and Greenpeace in a global initiative called 'Refrigerants,  Naturally!" Its goal is to address climate change and ozone layer depletion caused by HFC gases in refrigeration equipment.  PepsiCo was the first in the industry to mandate HFC-free insulation,  resulting in a 75 percent reduction in direct GHG emissions worldwide,  2008 vs.  2006 models.  In addition,  PepsiCo has begun field testing of coolers and venders with different green refrigerants.  
Partnering for Change We continue to develop external partnerships focused on strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2007,  PepsiCo joined the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency is Climate Leaders,  a voluntary partnership program that works to develop comprehensive climate change strategies,  including supporting reduction in greenhouse gases.  We are the first consumer products company to join with other concerned companies and non-governmental organizations in the U.S.  Climate Action Partnership to encourage the federal government to enact climate legislation.  
	 Indoor air quality 
Harnessing Renewable Energy 
	 Site stewardship 
Across PepsiCo,  we are evolving to the use of more renewable energy in our operations with several initiatives at our manufacturing plants.  
	 Lighting systems 
PepsiCo India launched our first remote wind turbineharnessing one of the most efficient,  clean and renewable sources of energy.  This turbine is connected to the public electricity grid with sufficient power to meet more than 75 percent of the electricity needs of the company is local Mamandur plant,  and it directly offsets up to 7 percent of our company-owned bottling operations' power requirements for 2008.  The initiative is estimated to help reduce carbon emissions by more than 3500 tonnes annually,  with the potential to offset 70000 tonnes of carbon emissions over its entire 20year lifecycle.  India is also converting company-owned manufacturing sites to biomass boiler capability.  Between wind and biomass,  we expect 18 percent of our energy needs in the company-owned sites of India to come from renewable sources for 2009.  Sun Chips  we are living up to our name Our Frito-Lay plant in ModestoCalifornia unveiled a solar concentrator field designed to drive the production of truly solar powered SunChips.  The Modesto plant is 5-acre solar concentrator field includes 54000 square feet of curved mirrors designed to absorb sunlight.  The solar energy captured by the 192 solar collectors produce steam that generates nearly three quarters of the heat used in the SunChips manufacturing process.  In 2007,  we announced plans for our first-ever  net zero" plant in Casa Grande,  Arizona.  With plans to run almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water,  retrofits to this existing Frito-Lay facility are scheduled to be completed by 2011.  Tropicana is Ft.  Pierce,  Florida facility has partnered with St.  Lucie County to burn landfill gas in its boiler.  Landfill gas displaces the use of natural gas and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.  The landfill gas provides the equivalent environmental benefit of 3600 acres of pine or fir forest or removing 1000 cars from the road 
per year.  These environmental benefits will increase as availability of landfill gas increases.  Solar concentrators in our Gamesa business in Mexico have provided lighting equal to conventional fixturessaving 30000 watts in a single distribution center.  Many other plants have also had lighting upgrades,  such as our Concentrate plants in the United States where highefficiency lighting and translucent ceiling panels have been installed.  We are also proud of our recent purchase of over 11 billion kilowatt-hours of Green-e© certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) annually to equal 100 percent of purchased electricity used by all U.S.  facilities.  The U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency estimates the PepsiCo purchase is the same amount of electricity needed to power nearly 90000 American homes annually.  Engaging Consumers: Climate Change We partnered with the Carbon Trust,  a U.K.  
government-funded independent organization that works to accelerate the move to a low-carbon economy,  to measure the carbon footprint of a package of Walkers Crisps.  The value of 75g of CO2e (equivalent carbon dioxide) per 345g bag,  calculated using the Carbon Trust is rigorous methodology,  includes every key step in the process  from planting the potato seed,  to the package arriving in store,  through to disposal of the empty bag.  After assessing the footprint,  we,  and the Carbon Trust,  wanted to tell consumers about Walkers' commitment to reduce the product is carbon footprint.  The launch of the world is first Carbon Trust Carbon Reduction Label was the result.  But we wanted to know how consumers are responding.  We commissioned consumer research and found that nearly 80 percent of consumers say that the label makes them 'more aware of the environmental impact of the products and services they choose to buy. " Carbon labeling shows real potential to drive behavior change by increasing consumer awareness of the environmental impact of the food they buy.  Since 2001,  Walkers has reduced energy use per pack by a third and water use by almost half.  
Packaging & Solid Waste We distribute our products in a variety of packageseach carefully designed to deliver convenience and appeal to our consumers while protecting the integrity of our products.  Our team of engineers and packaging suppliers are dedicated to finding preferable designsand are working continuously towards improving our packaging performance while reducing our packaging environmental footprint.  Our goal is to design and develop packaging systems that are environmentally responsible throughout their entire lifecycle and partner with leading organizations to promote sustainable packaging and recycling practices.  We have launched a global sustainable packaging policy 
	2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 3 	1 
and formed a Sustainable Packaging Council,  led by our Procurement and Packaging R&D organization,  to develop a roadmap that will guide us toward this goal.  The objectives of this team are to develop sustainable packaging strategies,  goals and targets and alternative packaging material technologies,  as well as to support responsible disposal practices.  PepsiCo has taken an industry leadership position in packaging.  Significant programs include: 	 Sustainable Packaging Coalition: PepsiCo is a member of the Executive Committee for this industryleading organization that provides lifecycle analysis and design guidelines for sustainable packaging.  	 Grocery Manufacturers Association/Food Products Association (GMA/FPA): PepsiCo is the GMA/FPA chair for the Packaging Sustainability Working Group.  This group is aim is to create an industry-wide public reporting process for consumers,  investors and other stakeholders to understand packaging and environmental improvements in a consistent and transparent manner.  	 The European Organization for Packaging and the Environment (EUROPEN): PepsiCo UK / Europe is a key member of EUROPEN,  a packaging supply chain body that champions packaging and the environmentwith representation at Board level.  Activating Sustainable Packaging Programs We follow five principles of sustainable packaging design: 	 Reduce: using less material in our packaging,  to conserve natural resources 	 Reuse: increasing use of reusable packaging and increasing the amount of recycled material in our packaging 
32	 2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 
	 Recycle: designing packaging for recycling and developing biodegradable and compostable packaging solutions 	 Remove: eliminating environmentally sensitive materials and processes from our packaging 	 Renew: increasing use of renewable material resources 
Using less material in our packaging Although beverage containers are the most recycled consumer packaging in the United States  and they are designed for recycling  we continue to look for ways to reduce the amount of packaging used for our products.  And we are achieving success.  PepsiCo scientists and packaging specialists have led the way in reducing packaging materials through cost-effective changes in design and production,  known in the industry as 'lightweighting. " Light-weighting reduces the amount of raw materials and energy used to make our packages and generates less waste after our products are enjoyed.  In 2008,  we introduced a new,  half-liter bottle for our Aquafina flavored waters,  Lipton Iced Teas,  and Tropicana juice drinks.  The new bottle contains 20 percent less plastic than the previous bottle and its label is 10 percent smaller than before.  These innovations are taking nearly 6 million kilograms of packaging out of the system each year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 18000 metric tonnes annually.  That is equivalent to taking 3350 cars off the road for a year.  We have trimmed the amount of plastic used in the bottlescaps and labels of our most popular Aquafina bottle  the half-liter (169 oz) bottle  by 35 percent since 2002.  This saves more than 27 million kilograms of plastic a year and reduces greenhouse emissions by 78000 metric tonnes annually.  That is equivalent to taking 14 thousand cars off the road for a year.  
Reducing and Recycling Our Waste PepsiCo is committed to reducing the generation of all types of waste,  reuse or recycle waste whenever feasible,  and only if necessary dispose of waste in an environmentally responsible manner.  PepsiCo has established global metrics for tracking and characterizing all types of waste in a uniform manner across all divisions.  
At Frito-Lay,  route sales employees return empty cartons from stores to our plants for reuse or recycling and delivery boxes are used an average of six to seven times  this saves nearly 5 million trees a year and keeps more than 25 million kilograms of cardboard away from landfills.  For Frito-Lay is North American and International products,  Frito-Lay recycles packaging film waste from our suppliers' sites for use in various other products such as park benches.  Our Quaker Oats facility in Cupar,  Scotland has reduced the amount of corrugate used by 30 percent over the past 5 years by moving to cases with open tops and reduced sides.  Over the last five years,  PepsiCo U.K.  has reduced the amount of plastic used to make Tropicana and Copella juice bottles by 18 percent.  Our Latin America Beverages business has optimized beverage packaging projects across Mexico,  PeruColumbia,  Bolivia,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Honduras and Guatemala,  specifically reducing the need for PET resin for bottles,  corrugate boxes,  bottle-top closures and glass.  The average Pepsi bottle contains 10 percent recycled plastic,  more than any other national soft drink brand.  Pepsi-Cola is bottles and cans are among the most recycled packages made  since 1990,  more than 150 billion Pepsi containers have been recycled.  Across all our U.S.  divisions,  initiatives conducted in 2007 to reduce packaging have resulted in more than 9 million kilograms of material reduction across PET bottles,  paperboard and corrugated materials.  Engaging Consumers: Recycling In 2008 Pepsi featured a Keep America Beautiful design on millions of Pepsi cans to spread the word about the organization and tell the story of how used 
cans gain new life through recycling.  The 'Have we met before?" campaign was designed to communicate the benefits of aluminum can recycling and encourage Pepsi consumers to make recycling a part of their daily routines.  The recycling facts and messages,  which were provided by the National Recycling Coalition,  have been featured on approximately 500 million Pepsi cans and 250 million Diet Pepsi cans nationwide each month.  That is a total of seven billion cans by the end of 2008.  	 Removing Environmentally Sensitive 	 Materials from the Waste Stream Quaker Standard Oatmeal has eliminated the PVC band on the 18oz.  tube and replaced it with biodegradable material,  eliminating more than 87000 kilograms of PVC a year.  
animal feed markets and a nearby university that utilizes oat hulls for the generation of power.  PepsiCo India has established a partnership with Exnora International,  an environmental non-government organization,  to manage domestic solid waste in an environmentally friendly manner.  In 2007,  the collaboration which began in 2005,  was selected by UNICEF as a model project and as a center for international learning.  The project involves reuse and recycling of waste.  	 
Solid Waste In the United States,  Frito-Lay sends close to 9 million kilograms of potato and corn solids (potato pulp and peelings,  cracked corn and corn husks) to America is livestock and dairy farms where it is used for feed.  Chips that do not meet Frito-Lay strict quality control standards and chips not sold in stores by the Guaranteed Fresh date,  can be used by livestock feeders and pet food manufacturers as a feed supplement.  This process diverts 7 million kilograms of unusable snacks that otherwise might have been sent to landfill.  Tropicana minimizes landfill waste by using virtually every part of the orange,  as well as its by-products after the juice is extracted.  The by-products become scent extracts and animal feed.  Quaker optimizes the use of all oat hull by-products.  Quaker delivers oat hulls to local

Keep America Beautiful,  Inc.  (KAB) is the largest nonprofit community improvement organization in the United States.  Pepsi is a longtime,  national sponsor of KAB is annual Great American Cleanup.  For the past three years,  Pepsi has brought together Sam is ClubKAB and the Aquafina water brand in a national,  schoolbased recycling program.  The program collected more than 70 million plastic bottles for recycling and gave away over 25000 backpacks made from recycled PET in 2007.  PepsiCo and the American Beverage Association are founding members of the National Recycling Partnershipa national nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement and improvement of recycling.  Its more than 4000 members include consumer product companies,  manufacturers that use recycled content in their products,  recycling processors,  government regulators,  and recycling advocates.  Pepsi supports comprehensive curbside programs as the most effective way to address solid waste in the United States.  Working with our supplier partners  Can Manufacturers Institute,  National Association of PET Container Resources (NAPCOR),  Glass Packaging Institute and the Association for Post consumer Plastics Recycling (APR)  we help support such efforts as the Curbside Value Partnership,  stadium and event recycling,  technical support to communities in need,  and efforts to increase public funding for recycling.  Engaging Suppliers: Environmental Sustainability Citrosuco is a leading supplier of not-from-concentrate orange juice to Tropicana.  It is a family-owned company with a Brazilian orange business founded more than 40 years ago.  More than 20 percent of its plantation area is set aside as nature reserves.  Another equivalent area is populated

with palm trees and other vegetation,  retaining rain water and providing natural wildlife habitats.  The reserve areas exceed the Brazilian environment agencies' required legal limit.  
efforts and adaptation strategies.  Our membership demonstrates to our suppliers how important we feel climate change is to business decision-making along with our desire to work collaboratively.  
Citrosuco is rolling out new environmental systems on its orange farms,  leading to higher efficiencies in pesticide and fertilizer use by,  for example,  analyzing the optimum time of day and weather conditions for applying,  which allows them to use less.  The company is juicing facilities are powered by biomass (sugar cane fiber) and use no fossil fuels.  Nutrients such as nitrogen are extractedcomposted,  and reused to naturally fertilize nearby farms.  Citrosuco is truck fleet is currently being upgraded with larger trucks fitted to existing trailers,  which can carry 30 percent more juice with the same number of trips,  reducing fuel use.  The efficiency of Citrosuco is ships has been improved by utilizing deck space to transport specialty goods,  such as large wind-turbine blades and generators.  
We have joined other companies and Greenpeace in a global initiative called 'Refrigerants,  Naturally!" Its goal is to address climate change and ozone layer depletion caused by gases in refrigeration equipment by working with our suppliers to improve the environmental performance of our coolers and marketing equipment.  Virtually all of our new purchases of refrigerated pointof-sale equipment in the United States use HFC-free insulation.  
Supply Chain Extending Resource Conservation Working with our supplier community on specific initiatives,  PepsiCo is able to grow and extend our effective resource conservation programs.  We are also focused on setting quantifiable goals for energygreenhouse gases (GHG),  water,  agriculture and forestry resource conservation within the extended supply chain.  Some examples of our Supplier Outreach program in action include: Our UK and Ireland business is one of 12 charter members of the Carbon Disclosure Project is Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration (SCLC).  This group aims to dramatically increase to the thousands the number of its member-suppliers reporting on climate change mitigation 
In 2008,  PepsiCo implemented a Resource Conservation Outreach program designed to share resources,  toolsand expertise in the area of energy conservation with key suppliers.  The initial phase of this effort involved reaching out to 12 contract manufacturing partners for Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America to assist them in developing energy management systems and projects.  This program has been very successful and will be expanded to include additional contract manufacturers and other key suppliers in 2009.  We also work with suppliers to use more renewable energy sources in the production of materials.  In North America,  PepsiCo has increased the selection of suppliers certified in credible resource conservation initiatives.  Examples include: 	 Energy Star (EPA) 	 Climate Leaders (EPA) 	 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 	 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 	 Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) 	 Refrigerants Naturally! 	 Rainforest Alliance 
Sustainable Agriculture Instituting Our Global We are currently formalizing our Global Sustainable Agriculture Policy,  which demonstrates our thoughtful approach to working across the agricultural supply chain.  We continuously benchmark against our industry peers to understand best practices and approaches to sustainable agriculture,  including water saving techniques,  waste reuse,  soil protection and chemical use.  
	 Continuously develops new growing areas closer to FLNA manufacturing plants reducing the diesel fuel used to transport inbound potatoes.  
PepsiCo has initiated a Sustainable Water and Nutrition Management program.  This program enables sustainableenvironmentally responsible water management of our potato crops by monitoring irrigation methods.  Countries involved in the project include the United KingdomUnited States,  Mexico,  Australia,  Egypt,  China,  PortugalRepublic of South Africa,  Pakistan and Turkey.  
	 Includes terms in its contracts with all corn and potato growers that require chemical application practicesquantities and timing to be in full compliance with the label instructions.  
Working with Our Growers PepsiCo works with our growers to encourage sustainable agricultural practices.  	 Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) 	 Has developed protocols to wash potatoes at the farm to reduce or eliminate the residual soil shipped to our plants,  thereby allowing this soil to be redistributed at the farm rather than disposed of through the plants waste water discharge and reducing diesel fuel requirements.  	 Practices low or no till soil preparation which results in lower irrigation requirements.  Pivot irrigation practices are used (versus flood irrigation) which are more efficient in the use of water.  	 Has developed potato varieties that store longer and are resistant to disease.  This allows FLNA to grow its potatoes in the most efficient agronomic areas across the United States and results in higher production per acre.  Higher production per acre minimizes the use of all farm inputs including,  water,  fertilizer,  pesticides and herbicides.  
	 Practices the use of cover crops to reduce soil erosion at our suppliers' farms.  	 Requires an independent chemical use and agricultural practice audit of all our potato and corn growers in North America.  
	 Shares agricultural best practices with all its corn and potato growers.  Tropicana 	 Uses virtually every part of the orange,  including the peels which are sold as cattle feed.  Before the peel is dried into cattle feed,  Tropicana extracts valuable oilsessences and biodegradable solvents.  These products are then sold or used by the company.  	 Encourages its growers to follow various Best Management Practices (BMPs) published by the University of Florida,  as well as several regional Grower Trade Associations,  which include guidelines for water conservation.  Quaker and Convenience Foods  North America 	 Has been a leader for decades in the oat industrydeveloping new oat varieties that deliver increased field yields and improved disease resistance.  Improving field performance through new oat varieties reduces fertilizers,  fungicide and herbicide use.  Improved oat varieties generate more oats per acre  reducing the time,  energy and resources required per crop.  	 Supplies over 200 million pounds of oat hulls as raw 
	2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 3 	5 
material ingredients and as a renewable source of fuel for the generation of steam.  One hundred percent of the oat hulls are utilized as either a raw material or fuel source,  reducing dependence on less renewable sources of fuel.  	 Sources corn locally,  reducing the environmental impact of transportation and works with major suppliers and railroads to optimize oat rail freight throughout the year via the use of multi-car,  unit trains.  	 Encourages the use of established,  low till practices on oats that conserve both water and fuel.  PepsiCo International PepsiCo International agro-programs encourage the application of environmentally sound agricultural practices with our suppliers.  We provide assistance to farmers and raw material suppliers where appropriate and assess their compliance against both regulations and PepsiCo agro-standards.  In China,  through various collaborations,  our foods team there is successfully growing potatoes under desert conditions by utilizing in-plant conservation approachescoupled with the installation of pivot irrigation systems.  In Brazil,  a soil conservation initiative for potatoes has been ongoing and involves minimal soil preparation to reduce soil degradation along with a fuel consumption analysis in order to decrease the use of fuel by reducing the use of the tractors and also by purchasing smaller machinery.  In Mexico,  our Sabritas Agro Team has activated 'Campo Limpio, " an outreach initiative to educate farmers about sustainable agricultural practices in production fields.  The goal is to help farmers reduce chemical and microbiological agents in fields and in raw materials.  We aim to further increase the commitment of our growers to 
36	 2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 
the safe handling of our raw materials,  in particular corn and potatoes,  through a training and certificate program that focuses on good agricultural practices.  Investing in Research In the United Kingdom,  we are investing in a number of research projects by leading experts on sustainable farming and agriculture.  We commissioned a Life-Cycle Assessment of potato and oat agricultural practicesand an energy audit of potato stores for our Walkers business.  The audit will assess different types of stores (e.g.  box,  bulk,  old and new) to identify where CO2e savings can be made.  We have commissioned an assessment of the climate change risks and opportunities for European oats production to be carried out by the University of Bath.  We are looking at how to reduce soil erosion from potato farming,  and what varieties of potato would consume less water while growing.  Quaker was a charter member of Linking Environment and Farming (LEAF),  which helps farmers make a positive environmental contribution by improving their growing and harvesting practices,  and their use of water and fertilizer.  We have partnered with the Scottish Crop Research Institute to investigate new potato varieties that would require less water and we are investing in new research into irrigation optimization.  The project aims to compare the effectiveness of various agricultural irrigation systems aimed at managing and conserving water resources from surface and borehole sources.  In China we share knowledge about potato farming with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and have established an advanced potato research laboratory.

Providing a Safe and Healthy Work Environment The safety,  health and well-being of our employees around the world are of utmost importance.  PepsiCo is proud to live by our Sustainability Vision and we believe that protecting the health and safety of our people is a core value.  
	2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 3 	8 
Occupational Health and Safety 	 PepsiCo believes that a safe and healthy workplace is a basic human right,  and protecting the health and safety of our people are among our core values.  We have communicated our beliefs and commitment to them in our company is Occupational Health and Safety policyand have adopted an integrated framework for managing environment,  health and safety risks (the PepsiCo EHSMS framework).  Occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable and we aspire to an incident-free environment The PepsiCo EHSMS framework combines our environment,  health and safety expectations for all of our business units and aligns with the international Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series management standard OHSAS 18001:2007 and international specification for Environmental Management Systems ISO14001:2007.  Many of our facilities have been externally accredited for their health and safety management systems and performance.  In the United States,  28 Frito-Lay North America plants,  one Quaker Foods North America and four North American Beverage plants have been recognized under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) Star program.  Additionally,  our Quaker,  Tropicana and Gatorade plants in North America have been invited by OSHA to participate in Phase 2 of the VPP Corporate Pilot.  Globally,  five of our international plants have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification.  Our remaining plants continue to implement the PepsiCo EHSMS framework.  
39	 2007-2008 PepsiCo Corporate Sustainability Report 
Our OHS policy,  which was released in 2008,  describes our obligations under eight areas: 1.  Regulatory Compliance We track our OHS legal and regulatory requirements in each business unit and country where we operate.  Some countries where we operate have minimal health and safety legislation,  which is why we manage risks by setting minimum requirements across our divisions.  This includes standards for our high risk areas such as fleet safety and ergonomics.  Each PepsiCo business unit has developed an internal audit tool to verify conformance with our internal standards.  Our UK snacks business,  Walkers,  has addressed risks associated with logistics and our trucking workforce.  2.  Resource Allocation We allocate responsibility and accountability for health and safety at each of our facilities and across PepsiCo divisions.  Each division has corporate staff that strategically leads our health and safety effortsand we share health and safety best practices across the company using a web-based information sharing environment.  3.  Business Integration We incorporate health and safety into our annual planning process and consider health and safety in our decision making processes.  Our Quaker,  Tropicana and Gatorade businesses conduct regular audits of our site health and safety programs,  resulting in Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) where necessary.  Audit CAP execution is tracked and reported on a quarterly basis.  We also ensure injuries,  illnesses,  and other significant incidents are fully investigated,  with prompt implementation and reapplication of preventive countermeasures.  
4.  Continuous Improvement Consistent with our commitment to the environment and many other areas of the business,  we also adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement for health and safety.  This expectation is embedded in our EHSMS framework.  5.  Performance Measurement We use lost time injury rate (LTIR) as one of our global metrics for health and safety performance.  Collecting health and safety data continues to be an opportunity for us globally due to increased growth of our international business and range of employees across the field.  We have implemented procedures to improve the reliability of our data and aim to expand our metrics collection beyond our manufacturing sites in 2009 for all PepsiCo divisions.  
We recognize health and safety performance within the PepsiCo business units.  PepsiCo International awarded our first annual health and safety award for (1) implementing systems,  (2) identifying a solution to a health and safety problem,  and (3) engaging and empowering our people.  We recognized our Indian Snacks business unit,  our concentrate plant in Puerto Rico and a snacks plant in Turkey.  In FritoLay North America,  safety is a core responsibility and is evaluated during annual performance reviews.  We have integrated health and safety into numerous region and site reward and recognition programs.  Frito-Lay Transportation has received several outside awards for fleet safety excellence.  In our Quaker,  Tropicana and Gatorade businesses,  our annual Founders' Award for outstanding plant performance includes Health,  SafetyEnvironmental (HSE) performance as part of the criteria.  Furthermore,  each site vies for the Annual HSE Award.  HSE metrics factored into both the Founders' Award and the HSE Award include both in-process metrics and outcome measures.  6.  Ownership Culture We believe that health and safety can be best managed by adopting a proactive culture and driving ownership at the individual,  managerial and organizational levels.  For example,  within Quaker,  Tropicana and Gatoradewe expect 100% of our site salaried workforce and 33% of our Associates to be directly engaged in one or more aspects of our formal HSE programs.  This engagement expectation goes well beyond basic HSE participation activities such as inspections,  incident investigationsand behavior observations.  We have used innovative approaches to engage our people,  beyond traditional training.  A snacks plant in Suadiye,  Turkey,  performed a health and safety theatre production involving short plays that were written,  produced and acted by our front line employees.  In a Gamesa plant in Mexico,  the children of our employees participated in a poster campaign to 
engage their parents in working safely both at work and home.  Frito-Lay is safety culture is based on a strong ownership from front line technicians engaged in multiple safety teams at each facility.  Our plants use safety committees to solve health and safety problems and consult with our employees about occupational health and safety matters.  During the development of the PepsiCo Occupational Health and Safety Policy,  we directly consulted with more than 500 employees and incorporated their feedback into the policy.  We use our confidential Speak Up line for employees to identify and report any concerns about health and safety conditions,  which are then followed up for action.  7.  Stakeholder Collaboration As a signatory to the United Nations Global CompactPepsiCo is visibly committed to all of its ten principlesincluding those for Human Rights and Labor Standards.  We collaborate with our contractors,  licensed bottlerssuppliers,  customers and local communities to reduce the health and safety impacts of our daily operations and technology,  as it applies to them.  8.  Annual Review We have set up a governance team,  led by the PepsiCo Chief Personnel Officer,  with accountability to our Chairman and CEO,  to monitor and review our performance and progress for health and safety (the PepsiCo Health & Safety Leadership Council).  The Council meets bimonthly and provides strategic direction and reviews,  among other things,  our progress in implementing the PepsiCo EHSMS framework.  The Health & Safety Leadership Council has led the development of an orientation training video to communicate the PepsiCo vision for health and safety.

Executive leadership training focuses on helping high potential managers learn to be more effective leaders and to gain a broader perspective of our business.  As a guide for associates in all functions and at all levels of our organization,  we introduced the PepsiCo Leadership and Individual Effectiveness Model in 2007.  The model details the key competencies and associated behaviors that are required - individually and collectively - to assure we reach our performance goals.  Regardless of current role,  level or career aspiration,  every associate can use the model to understand which behaviors they should strive for today and what will contribute to their own personal success,  as well as success for PepsiCo.  Beginning in 2008,  we aligned our 360-degree feedback process with the PepsiCo Leadership and Individual Effectiveness Model to make it more robust and ensure that leaders know and understand what is expected of them.  As a new and significantly valuable addition,  we will combine the 360-degree process with other feedback tools to further build self-awareness and provide participants with rich,  one-on-one developmental feedback from trained and certified facilitators.  In 2007,  we introduced a concept called 'One Simple Thing, " which strives to help associates better balance work and home by agreeing with their manager to make one 
change.  All employees receive regular performance and career development reviews annually.  We also ask associates to respond to an 'Organizational Health" survey,  generally every other year.

Extending Talent Sustainability Principles to our Supplier Community Supplier CSR Assurance Program We communicate,  educate and work with our suppliers to improve corporate social responsibility performance across the Supply Chain.  In 2007,  PepsiCo developed a Supplier Code of Conduct to clarify our global expectations in the areas of labor practices,  employee health and safety,  environmental management and business integrity.  It has been translated into 18 additional languages,  has been proactively communicated and is mandatory in all procurement contracts.  Our Supplier Code is based on the ILO,  UNGC and other benchmark standards.  To further demonstrate our commitment to sustainability within our supply chain,  PepsiCo joined the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex).

Sedex members are committed to continuous improvement of the ethical performance of their supply chains.  
"PepsiCo is involvement with Sedex enables its supply chain partners to share in its vision of Performance with Purpose.  By actively 
encouraging the sharing of information,  PepsiCo will gain transparency within its supply chain and improve performance.  As Supply chains are increasingly global and interlinked,  PepsiCo recognizes that its supply chain is complexwith many tiers of participants,  who may also be supplying peer companies.  PepsiCo is committed to working collaboratively with likeminded peer companies to send a consistent message to suppliers,  and to collectively understand and improve supplier performance in the areas of employee labor conditionshealth and safety,  environmental management and business integrity.  This is a way forward for businesses that want to have a real and sustainable impact.
