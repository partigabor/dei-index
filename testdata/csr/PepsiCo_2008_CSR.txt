As one of the world is largest food and beverage companies,  we recognize our responsibility to help make a positive contribution in a world that continues to experience unprecedented economic,  environmental,  and social challenges.  In this overview,  we share our progress in addressing these challenges,  identify where we believe we can have the most impact,  and acknowledge our opportunities for continued improvement.  We will continue to develop,  improve,  and report metrics to measure our global performance.  While this process will take time,  we believe that it will help us both embed sustainability goals more fully into our operations and achieve demonstrable progress.  Our approach to sustainability remains grounded in our Performance with Purpose mission: a balance of achieving continued financial success while leaving a positive imprint on society.  Specifically,  we have defined three areas of influence: human,  environmental,  and talent sustainability.  Human Sustainability 
Environmental Sustainability 
Talent Sustainability 
Nourishing our consumers through the products we offer—from treats to healthy eats—and through our efforts to encourage more active lifestyles 
Protecting our natural resources and operating in a way that minimizes our environmental footprint

This report provides a review of all three areas and offers a more in-depth look at our company is efforts with respect to water,  climate change,  agriculture,  packaging and waste.  We believe that the power of our global workforce,  coupled with our operational capabilities and international reach,  provide our company with a unique opportunity to have a positive impact on society.

In the United States and in some other countriesindependent franchise bottlers manufacture and distribute our beverage products.  Our three largest bottlers in the U.S.  are The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),  PepsiAmericas,  Inc.,  and Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC.  Our ownership of each of these bottlers is less than 50 percent,  and because we do not control these bottlers,  we do not consolidate their results or include their information in this report except as noted in the text.

Human Sustainability The world today faces many public health challenges and,  as a responsible company,  we recognize our part in helping to improve the well-being of populations in both developed and developing countries.  
Dear Fellow StakeholdersEvery day,  PepsiCo earns its license to operate in the thousands of communities we serve.  As one of the world is largest food and beverage companieswe have some distinct responsibilities.  We have a responsibility to support economic development,  to improve our environmental footprint and to help work toward solutions to issues such as obesity and undernourishment.  This reportcalled Performance with Purpose: Creating a Better Tomorrow for Future Generations,  captures the progress we have made thus far and provides a map of where we intend to go.  Performance with Purpose is fundamental to our overall success.  There is no question that these are challenging times.  Like many companies,  we are facing headwinds such as rising costs,  an uncertain economic outlook and shifting currency exchange rates.  While we can't control macroeconomic trendswe must adapt to the near-term challenges to deliver on our long-term growth plans.  But this cannot be an excuse to reduce our commitment to responsible business.  Indeed,  financial performance can and must go hand in hand with sustainability.  Our performance and our purpose are not separate— each is knitted inextricably with the other.  That relationship can be seen in the three areas that together comprise Performance with Purpose: HumanEnvironmental and Talent sustainability.  These focus areas will guide the way we do business.  They will continue to be shaped in dialogue with key stakeholders.  In this way,  we intend to maintain our long-term commitment to the overall sustainability of our company.  12 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
Our aim is to nourish consumers by developing products that satisfy the consumer is changing preferences and that deliver exceptional taste and convenience.  Increasingly,  our product portfolio makes it more enjoyable to lead a healthy life.  We are changing because our consumer is changing and because the health of the world is growing population demands it.  To meet this demand,  we have appointed new leaders to our global R&D team,  including world-renowned clinical scientists.  We have increased our R&D investment and dramatically expanded our capabilities.  We have accelerated our innovation pipeline,  acquired companies to extend our offerings of more nutritious products and actively cultivated partnerships to guide our work.  We will use our influence to drive positive change in the food industry.  
Environmental Sustainability As a responsible company,  we seek to continually drive environmental sustainability by abiding by applicable laws and regulations and,  in certain instances where we believe the requirements may not be sufficiently advanced,  we apply higher standards.  Recently,  Bureau Veritas issued independent verification of our environmental data.  We will continue to audit our performance,  share our progress and actively lead and engage in private-public partnerships to spur action and solutions to address the world is environmental issues.  But we want to go further than that.  We have focused our environmental sustainability efforts on the areas wherebecause of our expertise,  we can have the most impact: water,  climate change,  agriculture and packaging.  We are working hard to minimize our water footprint and improve public access to clean water through alliances with nonprofit groups such as The Earth Institute and Water, org.  We are intent on mitigating climate change and continuing our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  After more than 
 decade of action,  we continue to form partnerships with key stakeholders such as the Carbon Trust to provide us with additional insights,  expertise and knowledge.  
Talent Sustainability By valuing our employees,  we are ensuring that PepsiCo is the kind of company where talented people of all backgrounds want to work.  We recognize our responsibility to take care of our employees and their families,  especially during this global economic downturn.

We are extending our human rights standards throughout our operations and encourage our suppliers and agricultural partners to uphold our commitment to sustainable development.  
Conclusion I believe our Performance with Purpose mission defines our roles and responsibilities very clearly.  It motivates our 198000 employees to be leaders in social responsibility and helps each of us create a better tomorrow for future generations.  We look forward to sharing our progress and I look forward to your feedback.  I encourage you to share your comments on our corporate citizenship report at PerformanceWithPurpose[at] pepsico, com.  
Indra K.  Nooyi Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
PepsiCo is a proud partner with the Carbon Trust,  a U.K. -based,  independentnot-for-profit company that helps businesses address climate change.  
Tough economic times raise tough questions.  And sustainability features among these questions as never before.  Should sustainability take a back seat while we sort out the global economy? Isn't it just a luxury for the good times? Management time and capital are in short supply.  But forward-thinking companies recognise the importance of taking action now,  in the midst of a downturn.  In the short term,  efficiency savings help the bottom line whilst factoring sustainability into the development of products and services builds longer-term strategic advantage.  At the Carbon Trust we have been working with PepsiCo since 2003 on its response to climate change.  This started with energy efficiency projects across its sites but more recently led to groundbreaking work on product carbon footprinting and labelling.  The Walkers brand was the first to carry our Carbon Reduction Label in the UK and Ireland.  Quaker Oats now carries the Label and Tropicana was the first US brand to disclose its certified footprint in March 2009.  PepsiCo has seen a range of benefits from this work including a better understanding of the business risks of climate change,  energy cost reductions across the supply chain and enhanced relationships with staffsuppliers and customers.  This all makes business sense 13 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
as well as making a valuable contribution to their sustainability goals.  But maintaining global leadership on climate change mitigation is not easy.  Global companies have to deal with increasingly complex supply chains,  differing regulatory regimes in each market and varying levels of customer engagement around the world.  The companies that will succeed in this environment are those which bind their business objectives and sustainability goals into a single vision.  It takes leadership from the top but also buy-in right across the organization.  And for leading brands,  this means more than managing direct impacts — engaging and prompting action with suppliers and customers is where the real advances will be made in the future.  And for leading brands,  this means more than managing direct impacts—engaging and prompting action with suppliers and customers is where the real advances will be made in the future.

We have also committed to cutting company-wide water use by 20%,  electricity by 20% and fuel by 25% by 2015,  compared to 2006 usage levels.  In additionThe Earth Institute at Columbia University and the PepsiCo Foundation entered into a $6 million,  three-year partnership.  The program includes a series of community-based activities to address water,  agriculture and climate issues.  
Develop a Global Partnership for Development Our leaders actively participate in global health and development initiatives where we partner with groups including the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)Synergos,  the World Health Organization,  the Pan American Health Organization and Un Kilo au Yuda,  among others.

HUMAN SUSTAINABILITY 
We Recognize Our Responsibility to Provide Balanced Nutrition MEHMOOD KHAN,  MD,  Chief Scientific Officer 
As one of the world is largest food and beverage companies,  we believe it is our responsibility to understand the diet and nutrition needs of populations around the globe.  More than ever,  consumers want products that are safeaffordable,  great-tasting and healthy.  They are increasingly looking closely at the nutritional content of the products they consume and purchase for their families,  such as salt content and saturated fat,  because they want to eat well and improve their overall health.  They want options that offer nutritional benefits to meet the differing needs of various life stages,  from childhood through late adulthood.  Consumers are also managing specific health conditionssuch as diabetes and high cholesterol,  and expect onpack health claims to be grounded in credible science.  Understanding these health needs and attitudes is vital to our business,  but the global market is even more dynamic and complex.  Today,  more than one billion adults are overweight or obese while at the same time,  more than one billion adults and children are undernourished — in both developing and developed countries.  Often these overweight and undernourished individuals live side by side in the same cities and communities,  a paradox that has never been observed to this scale in the history of mankind.  The projected rise of global obesity and global hunger presents a tremendous challenge to the health and viability of individuals and communities.  
16 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
We are mindful of the way the world is changing.  How we choose to respond to these societal challenges is critical to the future of our business and to our planet.  This is why we are changing the way we innovate at PepsiCo.  In 2008,  we expanded our global research and development capability to address these challenges.  Our network of senior leaders includes world-renowned clinical scientists and experts in science,  technology,  nutrition,  food science and safety,  public health,  epidemiology,  product development,  behavioral medicine and health policy.  These experts give PepsiCo a unique understanding of individual human physiology and the nutrition needs of populations.  These global R&D teams are developing products rooted in rigorous,  science-based nutrition standards and produced to the highest standards of qualitywith the promise of satisfying a diverse global palette.  The hub of this work is eight regional research centers,  each focused on leveraging nutrition science and knowledge to develop convenient foods and beverages that can improve overall diets and positively impact health.  Three centers are located in the United States: Valhalla,  N. Y. ; Plano,  Tex. ; and Barrington,  Ill.  Other centers are in Leicester,  United Kingdom; Monterrey and Mexico City,  Mexico; ShanghaiChina; and New Delhi,  India; with  isatellite" centers in Thailand,  Brazil and Australia.  In addition,  we are broadening our open innovation efforts through new research partnerships with leading institutions,  including: Yale UniversityDresden University,  Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,  and several universities in India.  
HUMAN SUSTAINABILITY 
We are introducing products with more whole grains,  fiberfruits and vegetables,  and are reformulating some of our existing products by reducing trans fats to negligible levels while also reducing total fat,  saturated fat,  salt and added sugar.  We are dedicated to ensuring the integrity of our health claims,  all of which are reviewed by qualified nutrition and regulatory experts following strict procedures and standards.  
Members of the Walkers R&D team focus on science-based nutrition standards as they develop food and beverage products at the state-of-theart Beaumont Park research and development facility in Leicester,  U.K.  
Across our global portfolio,  we are offering consumers smaller portion sizes.  In fact,  in the United Kingdoma greater proportion of our sales come from smaller portion sizes.  Over 80% of Walkers Crisps sales are from 25 gram bags purchased in multipacks; 2% of sales are from 50 gram bags.  Our goal is to continue to develop products that are affordable and accessible.  We do not charge a premium for our zero sugar/ zero calorie varietiesfor instance.  
17 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
We are helping consumers make smart choices more easily by providing easy-to-understand nutrition labeling.  We also understand the importance of being a responsible marketer.  PepsiCo believes that industry-wide voluntary action continues to be the best way to address our responsibilities.  We endorse the International Council of Beverages Associations' guidelines on marketing to children — a landmark industry initiative which does not permit marketing or advertising of beverages,  other than water,  fruit juice and dairy-based beverages,  to children under 12 years old.  We are committed to helping reduce the terrible burden of hunger everywhere we do business.  PepsiCo has efforts under way to help support the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals,  including the goal to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.  In addition to funding,  we are providing experts who offer counsel in many areas—from product development to building distribution networks—in such countries as India,  South Africa and Nigeria.  In addition,  we'll have the opportunity to leverage any new discoveries to create affordable products for low-income consumers in developed countries around the world.  
Every serving of SunBites contains more than one-third of the suggested daily amount of whole grains.  
We know the importance of establishing partnerships with key stakeholders to help make a positive contribution to the world is nutrition needs.  Our leaders contribute to initiatives led by the World Health Organization (WHO)the National Institutes of Health,  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition,  the Pan American Health Organization and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.  For examplewe are among the nine leading food and beverage companies to commit to the goals of the 'Global Commitment to Action on the Global Strategy on Diet,  Physical Activity and Health" and to report on our progress,  annuallyat the World Health Assembly.  We intend to continue measuring and reporting on our progress so that our consumers and other industry leaders can share in the lessons we are learning.  
We have acquired a stake in JSC Lebedyanskythe world is sixth largest juice manufacturer.  
At PepsiCo,  we are privileged to use the lessons gained from our global vantage point not only to improve our business,  but to contribute to our common goal of finding solutions to some of the world is most persistent social challenges.

Our Management PepsiCo continues to evolve its approach to systematically obtaining policy and scientific advice.  An intensive review of PepsiCo is external health and wellness advisory structure was completed in late 2008 by the University of Toronto is McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health and Director of Ethics and Policy.  Based on its recommendation,  PepsiCo is refining its approach to policy,  science and bioethics as follows: The PepsiCo Blue Ribbon Advisory Board (BRAB) will be reshaped in 2009 to become the PepsiCo Policy Advisory Committee.  Reporting to and appointed by the CEO,  it provides high-level policy advice that is global in scope and addresses the diversity of health and environmental issues that impinge on PepsiCo is work.  Complementary policy advisory committees now exist in all regions and in most major markets and focus on issues of direct relevance to their regions.  The regional committees report to the president of the regional and/or national business and will be represented in an annual global meeting to assure coherence of approaches.  In addition to our Human Sustainability Leadership Team,  led by our CSO and leaders from R&D,  Global Nutrition,  Public Policy,  Legal,  Communications and Marketing,  the Board of Directors,  PepsiCo is chairman and senior executive leaders are informed on health and wellness initiatives and issues on a quarterly basis.  Divisions of PepsiCo also leverage experts to help promote science-based understanding of food and beverage choices and their impact on health.  For example: the Quaker/Tropicana Breakfast Research Institute (BRI) established in late 2006 is now a web-based institute devoted to promoting a sciencebased understanding of the role of breakfast in the diet and the health implications of its consumption as part of a healthy lifestyle.  The BRI is comprised of scientists prominent in their fields,  and is led by renowned cardiologist Dr.  James Rippe.  > More information about the BRI

Internationally,  advisory boards in China,  the U.K.,  MexicoBrazil and India help to guide our efforts in health and wellness,  food safety,  regulatory compliance and innovation.  The development of the Global R&D structure and appointment of our first CSO has led to an upgrading of our relationships with leading academic and research-based organizations on a global basis.  In addition to these experts,  PepsiCo has created the International Food Safety and Nutrition Network (IFSAN).  This is a global network of PepsiCo R&D and food science professionals.  They have established specific priorities and codes of practice for PepsiCo regarding such things as food safety policy and promotional insert policies.  They also work with outside opinion leaders and agencies to provide advice and the PepsiCo perspective as needed.  
Focus on Emerging Markets PepsiCo focuses on keeping its brands strong and locally relevant in all of its markets.  In emerging markets,  PepsiCo has built innovation and R&D processes that have both local relevance and a global foundation.  For example,  PepsiCo has R&D centers in all the key regions of the world—Mexico,  the U.K.,  China,  Thailand and two  isatellite" centers in Brazil and Australia,  as well as the flagship R&D centers in the U.S.  In markets around the world,  our R&D teams support our growth by turning our global brands into local favorites.  We work closely with local master chefs who understand the preferred tastes and consumption patterns of people in specific regions and cultures.  These insights then inspire us to extend our existing brands and invent new categories and flavors.  In Asia,  we learned that people strongly prefer beverages that contain natural ingredients.  We responded by introducing Pepsi Raw with pure sugar cane.  We also experimented with local flavor combinations to create Tropicana Guo Bin Fena new category of exotic mixed juices.  This non-carbonated beverage,  available in Honey Melon & Jasmine and Orange & Honeysuckle,  became PepsiCo International is largest and most successful new product in 2008,  and helped us grow 
our market share in China is major cities.  The business dynamic is similar in other Asian markets as well,  where we have reshaped our product portfolios significantly to address local tastes and needs.  In Latin America,  we are adding capacity to our R&D centers in Mexico and Brazil,  allowing for 70% to 80% more innovation utilization.  We also launched new locally specific brands and flavors in 2008,  including Passion Fruit H2Oh! in Brazil and watermelon flavored Be-Light (flavored water) in Mexico.  For our fountain beverages found in select restaurant chainswe will execute consumer trials for three new beverage flavors,  Tamarind,  Hibiscus and Lime.  We are also increasing acquisitions in the region to add some locally relevant brands to our portfolio.  In Europe,  we use local flavors like paprika,  shashlik and red caviar.

Helping Consumers Make Better Choices with Nutrition Labeling We care about the health of consumers.  We want them to enjoy our products and we want to help make healthful food choices the easier choice.  product labeling PepsiCo is committed to providing safe,  wholesome products and to protecting equity in our brands,  trademarks and goodwill.  Our business divisions have implemented policies related to food safety,  labeling,  product integrity and quality.  PepsiCo complies with all legally required nutrition labeling.  Our policies cover food safety,  sanitation,  recalls and allergensand require that our products are coded,  labeled,  identifiableand traceable.  PepsiCo is in full compliance with required nutrition labeling and has voluntarily led the industry in 'full container labeling" on products where consumers may be reasonably expected to eat or drink the full container on one occasion.  Our compliance systems include website training,  monitoringpreventative measures and readiness for corrective action.  We have regular management reviews of our procedures and activities regarding our products.  On a global basis,  we label all ingredient information on the back of the product package and provide any other relevant nutrition information in compliance with local country guidelines.  PepsiCo is committed to providing clear and useful nutrition labeling that helps consumers make nutritionally informed choices.  A key way we do this is through our own nutrition labeling.  In the U.S.,  we were the first in the industry to introduce a symbol that makes it easier for consumers to identify which of our products contribute to a healthier lifestyle.  Our Smart Spot symbol—the symbol of Smart Choices Made Easy—is a simple labeling system that explains why each product is a smart choice.  PepsiCo is also a founding member of the U.S.  Keystone Food

and Nutrition Roundtable,  a multi-stakeholder group that seeks to drive improvements in the American diet.  
Engaging in Responsible Marketing and Advertising 
The Keystone Roundtable is a consensus forum of industryacademia,  the public health community and governmentworking collaboratively to create an easy-to-understand and uniform front-of-pack nutrition labeling program to help consumers make healthier choices among all packaged food and beverages products in the U.S.  
We understand the importance of being a responsible marketer.  We believe that industry-wide voluntary action continues to be the best way to address our responsibilities.  
In Europe,  we introduced front-of-pack nutritional labeling across our brands in partnership with other food and beverage companies.  The labels help consumers understand the percentage of the 'Guideline Daily Amount" (GDA) of caloriessugars,  saturates,  fat and salt contained in a portion of food or drink.  By year-end 2008,  100 percent of our snacks,  foods,  and beverages carried the GDA labeling on pack in the EU.  Daily Intake Guide (percent DI labeling) has been voluntarily introduced for our carbonated beverages,  multi-pack snacks and larger  isharing" packs as part of the industry-wide food labeling changes in Australia and New Zealand.  This labeling gives information on the calories and content of a range of key nutrients per serving to assist consumers in making informed food and beverage choices.  It was rolled out across the entire product range in Australia and New Zealand.  One of the five Vive Saludable strategic pillars is the responsible selling and marketing of our products and the promotion of healthy lifestyles among consumers.  This includes the clear and responsible labeling of ingredients and health benefits,  the creation of an icon system to communicate and educate consumers on nutrition benefits,  ensuring responsible communication and publicity of the health/ nutrition benefits of our products,  and promoting active lifestyles and healthy eating among schools and consumers.  The following countries currently have products with the Vive Saludable logo: MexicoGuatemala,  El Salvador,  Honduras,  Nicaragua,  Panama,  ChileArgentina,  Ecuador,  and Peru.  On a global basis,  we label all ingredient information on the back of the product package and provide any other relevant nutrition information in compliance with local country guidelines.  
PepsiCo recognizes that,  as a multinational food and beverage company with global brands that touch millions of consumers every day,  our communications carry a special responsibility.  We are committed to responsible marketing practicesincluding changing the balance of foods and beverages advertised to children.  We are also committed to ensuring that healthy choices are offered in schools.  We believe this will help children,  parents,  and schools make their dietary choices that support a healthy lifestyle.  PepsiCo has already made several global,  national,  and sectordriven commitments regarding responsible marketing to children and product placement in schools.  We announced our full support of the International Council of Beverages Associations' guidelines on marketing to children—a landmark initiative supported by industry.  The guidelines permit no marketing or advertising of beverages' other than water,  fruit juice and dairy-based beverages' to children under 12 years old.  The guidelines were fully implemented on a global basis by January 2009.  We were a founding member of a voluntary U.S.  food and beverage industry initiative that redefined how the industry markets products to children under 12.  Today,  100% of our advertising to children is devoted exclusively to products that meet defined nutrition criteria or provide a functional benefit.  We have committed to similar guidelines in Canada,  the European Union,  Mexico,  ThailandSouth Africa,  Australia and New Zealand.  Our global marketing policy is just the beginning of an ongoing effort to expand the commitment toward responsible marketing globally.  PepsiCo has joined the food and beverage industry in adopting Pledges in Australia,  Canada,  the EUSouth Africa,  Thailand and the U.S.,  and work is under way to introduce similar pledge programs and/or self-regulatory initiatives in other countries and regions,  including BrazilRussia,  Turkey,  the Middle East,  China,  South Africa,  the

Philippines,  and Latin America.  PepsiCo has a long-standing policy on the kinds of television programs that can carry our advertising messages.  We are committed to high standards in all our advertising,  including the environment in which our advertising appears.  We avoid advertising during excessively violent programs,  programs that may be distasteful as judged by contemporary societyand those that may be offensive to large groups of people.  We also attempt to avoid programs containing material inconsistent with or adverse to our products.  We seek to avoid programs featuring exceptionally controversial or potentially inflammatory discussions.  Children are a special audience,  and we take particular care in developing marketing practices and evaluating programs that carry messages to children.  We joined with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and other leaders in the U.S.  food and beverage industries to adopt voluntary guidelines for the products we offer to grade schools in the U.S.  As part of the commitment,  we agreed to remove full-calorie soft drinks from K-12 schools over three years.  Since 2004,  we have seen a nearly 60% drop in the calories of beverages shipped to these schools.

Food safety is at the top of our priority list as we select these materials,  and we have an excellent record in providing safe,  wholesome and nutritious products to our consumers.  To ensure that PepsiCo provides safe products with the highest quality,  we only use foodsingredients,  and packaging materials that have been deemed safe by scientific consensus and regulatory review.  The health and safety of our consumers is of the highest importance to us.  PepsiCo shares and actively supports its customers' interests in food safety,  and believes customers have a right to relevant information about the food they buy so that they can make informed purchasing decisions.  PepsiCo,  however,  believes that the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration,  and other national and international regulatory authorities who are charged with protecting the health and safety of the public and the environment,  are the proper entities,  rather than a manufacturer like PepsiCo,  to evaluate and make judgments about the labeling and sale of genetically engineered products.  PepsiCo takes its lead from national and international foodsafety and regulatory authorities,  and supports their efforts to take whatever steps are necessary,  based on sound scientific principles,  to ensure that any new food technology is safe for consumers and the environment.  While maintaining our own high internal food safety standards,  PepsiCo complies with all government food labeling regulations.  genetically modified ingredients PepsiCo is dedicated to producing the highest quality,  greatest tasting food and beverage products in every part of the world.

reason,  PepsiCo adheres to all relevant regulatory requirements regarding the use of genetically modified food crops and food ingredients within the countries in which it operates.  Where legally approved,  individual business units may choose to use or not use genetically modified ingredients based on regional preferences.  organic foods In North America,  PepsiCo currently offers certified organic products from Quaker.  Two varieties of Quaker Instant Oatmeal are certified organic.  Organic Quaker Instant Oatmeal is made with at least 95% organically produced ingredients.

All PepsiCo divisions conduct regular qualitative and quantitative research to understand our consumers' needs.  Our North America divisions conduct over 100 custom and standard studies per year.  These studies range from small focus groups (to learn from individual consumers),  to telephone or online surveys (to gain statistically significant insights).  Consumer insights are translated into product improvements,  new product ideas,  and communication tactics.  In the U.S.,  our packages carry a toll-free number and web address to allow consumers easy access to PepsiCo if they have 
questions or comments regarding the company or one of its products.  Each business has a Consumer Relations Department that serves as the first point of contact for all communications and correspondence received from our consumers.  Should consumers need to contact us after hours,  they can dial our toll-free number and a message will be activated offering them an emergency line number.  A special team of Consumer Relations professionals are available 24 hours a day,  7 days a week; and they can be contacted through our emergency line and will immediately return a call to a consumer or one of our field representatives.  In 2008,  PepsiCo call centers measured consumer satisfaction and service levels across all of their North America businesses.  The tools used covered a range of key consumer metrics including response rate,  representative knowledge/ professionalism,  satisfaction with resolution,  service level,  and willingness to recommend products to family/friend.  For example,  our Pepsi-Cola Company call center operates at an over 99% service level.  This indicates that the center answers and handles calls to the toll-free number without hold time for over 99% of calls,  well above industry standard.  When the consumer provides feedback or input via the call center,  this input is funneled to the correct business owner and addressed as appropriate.  customers PepsiCo is key customers are retailers and bottlers.

The following pages spotlight initiatives taking place around the world — in Mexico,  Indiathe U.K.  and the U.S.  — and illustrate how we approach our commitment to sustainability.  Our ability to improve the effectiveness of our environmental sustainability initiatives has been strengthened by the creation of common,  enterprise-wide metrics.  This is helping us to better understand and track our comprehensive environmental footprint and to be more transparent in our reporting.

One of the most exciting developments in our environmental sustainability efforts has been on the packaging front.  In 2008we introduced a new half-liter bottle for our Aquafina flavored waters,  Lipton Iced Teas,  and Tropicana juice drinks.  The new bottle contains 20% less plastic than the previous bottle and its label is 10% smaller than before.  These innovations are taking nearly 6 million kilograms of packaging out of the system each year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 18000 metric tons annually.  That is equivalent to taking 3350 cars off the road annually.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
Our goal is to design and develop packaging systems that are environmentally responsible throughout their entire life cycle.  We want to inspire consumers who are seeking ways to live more environmentally sustainable lives by promoting recycling.  In addition,  we want to partner with leading organizations to promote sustainable packaging and recycling practices.  Most recently,  we have launched a global sustainable packaging policy and formed a Sustainable Packaging Council to further our efforts in this area.  PepsiCo is commitment to environmental sustainability — a key plank of our Performance with Purpose mission — is part of how we do business every day.  The steps we have taken to minimize our impact and institute more robust,  enterprisewide processes to better track,  manage and understand our environmental footprint are helping us to do better each day.  With the expert knowledge,  world-class skills and breakthrough technology that empower our environmental teams across the globe,  I'm confident that this will lead to continuous progress.  
Our Environmental Policy 
The policy also expresses our commitment: to implement resource conservation,  environmental best practices,  and use of technology and innovation to minimize the potential environmental impacts of our business; to set goals and establish metrics to monitor continuous improvement in environmental performance; to work with stakeholders up and down our supply chain to reduce environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycle; and to review our performance in implementing our policy.

monitoring In 2005,  the PepsiCo Environmental Management System (EMS) framework was first developed with the help of an independent third party.  Since this time,  we have reviewed our performance and strategy,  and in 2008 we expanded the framework to encompass the environment,  health,  and safety.  We call this 12-element framework the PepsiCo EnvironmentalHealth & Safety Management System (EHSMS).  Key features of the PepsiCo EHSMS framework include: ōA risk-based management approach ōDocumented systems that capture and maintain institutional knowledge ōObjectives and targets for continuous improvement ōIntegration of environmental,  health and safety considerations into core business processes ōRoutine performance monitoring and internal management reporting The EHSMS framework is built along the lines of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  Twenty-one PepsiCo International facilities are ISO 14001 certified,  including nine in the United Kingdom.  Company-owned facilities or joint ventures with PepsiCo management control implement the PepsiCo EHSMS,  which aligns with ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  We have a total of 39 facilities that have been externally accredited to ISO 14001.  We estimate that more than 90% of PepsiCo International manufacturing facilities receive environmental management system audits by internal or external auditors.

capital expenditure filter PepsiCo incorporates sustainability criteria into our Capital Expenditure Filter (CapEx Filter),  and we are using it on all capital expenditure requests over $5 million.  Each request must include a review of the sustainability issues and opportunities surrounding the request.  The goal is to incorporate sustainability aspects into projects right from the start and track sustainability-related capital spending across PepsiCo.  This process is expected to help drive continued improvement.  education and awareness—engaging employees We are committed to educating our associates on the importance of environmental sustainability.  In addition to regular training of environmental personnel,  we conduct special events at which new ideas are shared.  In May 2008,  PepsiCo introduced the Sustainable Engineering Guidelines,  which are meant to support overall implementation of our environmental sustainability design principles throughout the engineering process,  and to improve efficiency in the use of natural resources.  The Sustainable Engineering Guidelines can be accessed through a website available to all PepsiCo employees and key partners worldwide.  We also offer workshops on ReCon,  our global eco-efficiency strategy for resource conservation within our operations,  to our engineersfacility operations teams,  bottlers and co-packers around the world.  Environmental sustainability is shared with all our associates through special activities to mark events such as Earth Day and World Water Week.  Environmental information is also included in our daily e-newsletter.  Our PepsiCo Americas Beverages businesses have quarterly employee e-newsletters dedicated to sharing environmental sustainability initiatives and projects in the region as well as showcasing best practices.  
In 2008,  U.S.  employees were offered Chronos,  an e-learning tutorial designed to help associates understand the landscape of sustainability and the business case for sustainable development.  It was created through a partnership with the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the University of Cambridge,  U.K..  green teams Frito-Lay North America maintains a dedicated team of experts across our manufacturing facilities focused on reducing consumption of electricity,  fuels,  and water.  Through 'GreenTeams" made up of groups of volunteer employeesmore than 12000 manufacturing associates have been trained to improve their environmental awareness and to understand how they can do their jobs without adversely impacting the environment.  Quaker,  Tropicana,  and Gatorade have established PepsiCo Green Chicago, " an overarching environmental sustainability initiative to raise employee awareness and create actionable tactics to improve the business and each associate is personal environmental footprint.  The focus is to raise awareness,  incite action and institutionalize sustainability improvement efforts across PepsiCo.

Water Pioneering Initiatives to Achieve Positive Water Balance 
reduced water use by more than 55% and in the last three years,  we have saved more than 25 billion liters of water through conservation efforts.  We have also prevented depletion of ground water aquifers by constructing rainwater harvesting systems in most of our plants.  
Water is required to make our products,  so that we maintain the highest quality standards for consumers—and water is required to ensure a clean and safe workplace for our employees and our suppliers.  In turn,  efficient use of water across our operations is nothing short of imperative.  We are committed to minimizing our global water use through greater efficiency,  innovative processes and new technologies.  
One of the most effective initiatives is our work with farmers to reduce water intensity in rice cultivation through a method called direct seeding.  Our India team has become a leading proponent of direct seeding of rice (versus transplanting seedlings from nurseries to paddies that are then flooded).  While direct seeding of rice is done in some countries,  it is not widely practiced in India.  
In 2008,  we conserved more than 75 billion liters of water as a result of gains in water efficiency from the 2006 baseline.  And while using water responsibly is a top priority,  we also believe in our ability to help address the broader challenge of water scarcity and to help avoid water conflicts in local communities.  
In India,  PepsiCo has been experimenting with direct seeding for four years—testing methods to improve yield and reduce weed growth and even developing a tractor-mounted direct seeding machine,  adjustable for seed variety,  planting depth and plant-to-plant spacing.  
In India,  all industry accounts for about 6% of total water use.  Within that 6%,  the soft drinks and bottled water industry accounts for about four-hundredths of 1%.  In comparisonagriculture accounts for over 80% of total fresh water use in the country.  To have significant impact on total water conservation,  farming must use water more efficiently.  We believe we can play an important role in providing solutions.  In 2003,  our India team embarked on an ambitious journey to achieve positive water balance—giving back as much as we take.  Through a comprehensive program to conserve and optimize water usage,  we have pioneered major initiatives by partnering with farmers,  working with numerous rural communities and establishing private-public partnerships with Punjab Agriculture University and The Energy Resources Institute (TERI).  We have carried out a variety of innovative reuse and recycling initiatives within our own operations; raised farm productivity,  which increased farmers' incomes; and improved the quality of life in many communities.  These initiatives,  among others,  will help us make significant progress toward positive water balance in 2009.  In the last five years,  our India manufacturing team has

After carrying out initial direct seeding trials at our own model farms,  pilot tests have been run in farmers' fields to confirm the results.  In 2008,  direct seeding was extended to more than 1000 acres in five states and the initiative saved close to 1 billion liters of water.  In addition to saving water,  it also reduced costs by 1400 rupees per acre for farmers.  Direct seeding will go a long way in enabling our India team to achieve positive water balance for our beverage business by 2009.  More important,  it has the potential to dramatically reduce water usage in a country where water is an increasingly precious commodity.  This single initiative is an example of both climate change mitigation and adaptation.  We are mitigating our impacts on climate change by using significantly less resourcesand helping our farm communities adapt to the changing environment.  
In India,  PepsiCo has been experimenting with direct seeding,  one of the most effective ways to reduce water use in rice cultivation.  Shown here is a direct seeding machine,  adjustable for seed variety,  planting depth and plant-to-plant spacing.  
Conserving Water in Our Operations One of the most important elements of sustainable water conservation is in-plant water conservation.  To formalize this in our manufacturing facilities and embed conservation practices into the day-to-day operations of the plant,  we have developed the water component of our successful Energy Resource Conservation (ReCon) tool.  Like the energy tool,  the water tool includes a PC- or web-based diagnostic,  with audit guidance and solution sets.  With this tool,  the manufacturing facility can conduct a self-audit of its water management practices.  To complement the Water ReCon tool,  we have developed a Water Profiler,  which will map and quantify all major water uses within the facility,  identify relative local costs of these applications,  and identify a 'hot list" of water conservation measures that can be implemented both short and long term.  We estimate that,  in general,  application of the Water ReCon Tool in a plant will result in a 10- to 20% reduction in water use.  The tool is now being expanded to our franchise bottler network and our co-packer partners.  We have instituted a number of other technological improvements in our global manufacturing operations to save water: 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
In the U.K.,  our total water use across all our foods and snacks operations was 14 billion liters in 2008.  Between 2001 and 2008,  we reduced the water used to manufacture Walkers Crisps by nearly 60%,  from 13 L/KG of production to 54 L/KG.  The Walkers team developed engineering solutions to reduce equipment water use and created sources for recycled water.  Frito-Lay,  the U.S.  snack division of PepsiCo,  continued to improve its water efficiency by conserving over 380 million gallons (1 billion liters) of water in 2008 as compared to 2006; through its continued water conservation efforts known as the 'Gallon per Pound Challenge, " Frito-Lay won recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency as a Water Efficiency Leader in 2007.  In 2008,  our Latin American operations participated in the Inter-American Water Day,  an awareness campaign aimed at raising awareness of the growing scarcity of potable water in the region and the importance of water conservation.  The program also had a volunteering component where PepsiCo employees visited schools to teach children about water conservation.  In addition,  in 2008,  Latin American Beverages manufacturing operations saved 28 million liters of water,  both in companyowned and franchise business.  As part of the same initiativewe also saved 31415 MWhr of electricity in our Latin America Beverage manufacturing operations.  In 2008,  PepsiCo reinforced its commitment to science and the environment through water conservation by using waterless rinsing technology at Gatorade is U.S.  plants.  Using air rinsing on all of our Gatorade and Propel lines,  the water savings are more than 5 million liters of water per year.  Pepsi-Cola franchise bottlers in North America are also doing their part.  Pepsi Bottling Group has installed reverse osmosis recovery systems or incorporated high recovery designs into their new manufacturing lines that cumulatively save more than 1 billion liters of water annually as compared to traditional designs.

How We Source Water 
Water Quality 
Across PepsiCo,  we have a variety of standardized processes and procedures to assure the safety of our consumersintegrity of our products and respect for the environment and community around us.  For new sites,  each of our businesses applies the elements of an environmental site assessmentsimilar to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards for Environmental Site Assessments.  
Our U.S.  facilities are primarily supplied by municipal water sources.  As such,  these sources comply with all applicable water quality requirements and provide Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR),  which detail the water quality being provided to the consumer as it compares to compliance with EPA quality requirements.  The water quality data is available from the municipal water purveyors whether the purchaser is PepsiCoone of our franchise partners,  or a home consumer.  
With specific regard to water sources,  we utilize a mixture of municipal supplies,  which may be from surface or groundwater sources and private wells.  In addition,  water resource selection at new sites is included in a PepsiCo-wide,  web-based tool called the PepsiCo Sustainable Engineering Guidelines.  This pan-enterprise effort captures all critical areas of new facility construction and provides solution sets for the user who encounters water-related or other risks.  In addition,  the tTool provides a 'fast-track" path to LEED certification.  PepsiCo was a full supporter and advisory board member in the development of a Water Resource Assessment Tool by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in conjunction with a globally recognized environmental consulting firm.  This tool was launched to global acclaim in Stockholm in 2007 and updated in 2009.  This risk mapping and management tool provides an assessment of relative water availability (abundance,  stress,  scarcity) for any physical location coordinates entered,  in addition to a wealth of other water-related information.  To the best of our knowledge,  this was the first comprehensive tool of its kind that was entered into the public domain completely free of charge—for use by any and all business sectors,  governments,  NGOs,  and other stakeholders.  We are currently mapping all PepsiCo facilities across the worldand both current and projected risk of water stress are being identified and evaluated by a doctoral level,  dedicated senior manager of water stewardship.  In addition,  this high-level assessment will be cascaded to our field operations for the next level of watershed risk assessment at the local level.  
Similarly,  outside the United States many of our plants are supplied by water from municipal sources,  and the same approach would apply.  In areas of the world where we develop our own water sources (for example,  extraction from commercial wells),  we do so in full compliance with applicable regulations concerning use of local resources.  In these caseswe work with the local authorities to assure that the quantity of water needed to run our business,  and thereby help support the local community and economy,  is consistent with regulations and safe for the natural resource.  Where we develop our own wells to supply water from groundwater sources,  every source is tested by an approvedexternal laboratory that is capable of reporting drinking water testing results.  The test protocol is based on the most current revision of the World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality,  and also includes testing required by local authorities.  Worldwide,  every water source used for our beverages must first be analytically qualified,  which includes using government-accredited,  recognized laboratories to test for a harmonized list of over 100 parameters,  covering many classes of raw water chemical/physical constituents.  In addition,  the microbial quality of the source is evaluated to help confirm that our products will be safe.  We also believe that protection of water at the source is important; accordingly,  a formal training program is provided to all of our key beverage plant personnel,  which covers areas such as water source selectionwell construction and source protection.  At every plant,  the incoming water is then further purified,  using a variety of treatments depending on the raw water characterization,  to meet the high standards of quality to be used in our products 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
— whether these products are bottled water,  carbonated beverages or non-carbonated drinks.  In addition to source qualification,  our plants monitor the raw,  in-process and treated water for a core list of parameters and at frequencies ranging from hourly to daily to weekly (depending on the specific parameter and application).  We have also established internal laboratories in the United States and Europe which routinely monitor raw,  treated,  and bottled water quality worldwide.  Once the water source is adequately identified for capacity and tested for quality,  conserving the amount of water used in our plants becomes a critical component of stewardship.  We seek to minimize our impact through traditional efforts to protect what we use.  We follow the U.S.  EPA guidelines (common to other governments as well) to reduce,  reuse and recycle water whenever possible.  at discharge PepsiCo recognizes that regulations vary considerably across the globe and that some may not be adequate from the perspective of responsible water stewardship.  Consequently,  we have developed and implemented the PepsiCo-wide Responsible Standards for Effluent,  which ensure environmentally safe,  responsible treatment and discharge of our process water waste streams across the world.  In addition to including and complying with local regulations,  these internal PepsiCo standards are also included in the twelve-element system-wide Environmental,  Health & Safety Management System Framework (EHSMS).  This combined EHSMS framework is compatible with ISO 14001 for Environmental Management Systems,  and OHSAS 18001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.  More than 30 PepsiCo facilities have achieved formal ISO 14001 certification,  and five have received formal certification to OHSAS 18001.  
Partnering for Change Water is unique in that it sits squarely at the nexus of climate change,  food security,  gender empowerment/education and global health.  Consequently,  PepsiCo believes that we have an obligation to positively impact the water crisis — in its many

Toward the end of 2007,  PepsiCo engaged in the WEF Water Advisory Group to develop a technical white paper on the topic of water use in agriculture,  industry and global health.  The intent was to use this as a vehicle,  targeted at the 1000+-CEO audience,  to place the global water crisis squarely at the center of attention and debate.  world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd) PepsiCo plays an active role in the WBCSD is Water Core Working Group,  which developed the WBCSD Water Resource Risk Tool and which was launched at World Water Week in Stockholm in August of 2007,  and re-launched with a more

based on careful review of the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol,  in our opinion it is not clear that Scope 3 is the most appropriate designation.  In 2009,  PepsiCo will work with relevant third-party experts and stakeholders in the beverage sector to develop formal guidance for designation of these source types.  > Statement from Bureau Veritas In 2003,  we began working with the Carbon Trust,  an independent,  not-for-profit company set up by the U.K.  government to help businesses address the growing threat of global climate change and to pioneer carbon footprinting methodology and standards.  The Carbon Trust believes that in order to effectively reduce a company is carbon footprint,  they must first know how to accurately measure it.  
We began the work with our leading crisp brand in the U.K. Walkers Crisps.  Following months of intense research,  Walkers became the first consumer brand to pilot the original method for assessing product carbon footprints and the first major food brand to display a carbon footprint/reduction label on its packs.  Since 2000,  Walkers has reduced its energy use per pack by onethird and its water use by 42%,  and it is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its products even further.  The collaborative work continued and,  most recently,  Tropicana Pure Premium Orange Juice became the first consumer brand in North America to be independently certified by the Carbon Trust.  The process included working with an academic research partner,  The Earth Institute at Columbia University,  to determine the mapping process.  The Carbon Trust then conducted a review of scientific life cycle data and certified the carbon footprint of a standard 64-ounce carton by: ōMapping the product life cycle,  from growing and squeezing oranges and getting the container on the shelves,  to finally disposing or recycling the packaging.  ōLooking at the energy consumption directly involved in each of these life cycle stages and converting this into equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e).  ōAdding the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e) from each stage to estimate the total product greenhouse gas footprint of the product.  Using this process,  the estimated carbon footprint for a 64-ounce carton was determined to be 17 kilograms.  The Carbon Trust has certified the footprint,  giving PepsiCo a verifiable benchmark against which the company can measure GHG reduction progress going forward.  In coming years,  additional products,  including Pepsi,  Diet PepsiAquafina,  and Gatorade,  will be assessed.  Today,  more than 10 products that represent a true market basket of our consumer offerings are currently being evaluated for a carbon footprint.  This science-based information is helping our businesses target operational improvements and achieve their energy efficiency goals,  while striving for even more ambitious ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
yet realistic,  targets.  Uncovering information about where and why carbon is generated in the manufacturing,  distribution and disposal of products will also help drive collaboration with partners and suppliers on carbon reduction initiatives and elevate consumer awareness.  
Reducing Our Energy Use Each division of PepsiCo is committed to achieving the 2015 reduction targets and has developed customized tactics to ensure their achievement: continued energy efficiency improvements to minimize energy intensity of our productsdevelopment of additional renewable energy generation at our own facilities,  support for renewable energy generation outside our facilities through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates,  and working cooperatively with our supply chain partners to share best practices in energy efficiency and sustainability improvement.  Large reductions in the use of non-renewable energy in the future will require innovative technologies.  Hastening the development and application of these technologies will take bold steps,  such as the one Frito-Lay has begun in an attempt to transform their Casa Grande,  Ariz.,  facility to a  net zero" manufacturing facility.  The goal of this project is to dramatically reduce the use of nonrenewable energy and water at an existing plant through implementation of transformational technology.  The first stage will involve installation of a water recovery and reuse process that is expected to reduce water consumption by over 80 %.  This project is under way,  with planned start-up in 2010.  The water recovery system allows for a section of the existing wastewater land-application area to be repurposed for use in a future solar and biomass system that will reduce the use of nonrenewable energy at the plant by 80% to 90%.  A 46 megawattcombined heat and power (CHP) plant was constructed at the Frito-Lay facility in Killingly,  Conn.  The CHP plant generates enough electricity to offset the total electrical demand of the plant at an efficiency exceeding twice that of electricity currently pulled from the grid.  As part of the projectan upgrade to the existing steam system at the plant was completed,  and we expect to prevent the loss of approximately

10000 MMBTU per year of flash steam and save the plant $100000 per year in energy costs.  
project is not only a milestone for environmental sustainabilitybut also a global model for all companies.  
PepsiCo India Beverages made the decision to focus on renewable energy sources to provide cleaner energy for its manufacturing sites across the country.  The switch took place quickly,  and the changes have already delivered significant cost savings and emissions reductions.  
At the Gatorade distribution facility in Tolleson,  Ariz.,  the facility installed the largest rooftop solar array in the state,  a 500-kilowatt system that will supply 40% of its annual energy needs—enough electricity to power 50 Arizona houses for a year.  The system is capable of producing more than 760000 kilowatt hours per year.  A solar thermal energy system was also installed on the roof top of the Tolleson Gatorade manufacturing plant,  located across the street from the warehouse.  The solar thermal system is capable of generating 52 billion BTUs per year and is one of the largest rooftop solar thermal concentrators in the United States.  
In 2007 and 2008,  17 oil-fired boilers were converted to use biomass briquettes at plants owned by PepsiCo India.  PepsiCo India also launched our first remote wind turbine,  harnessing one of the most efficient,  clean and renewable sources of energy.  This turbine is connected to the public electricity grid with sufficient power to meet more than two-thirds of the electricity needs of the company is local Mamandur plant,  and it directly offset up to 5% of our company-owned bottling operations' power requirements for 2008.  In 2008,  this initiative also reduced carbon emissions by about 3000 tons,  with the potential to offset more than $200000 per year.  India is also converting company-owned manufacturing sites to biomass boiler capability.  With our wind energy program and investments in solar lighting and biomass boilers,  more than 16% of the energy PepsiCo India used in company-owned plants during 2008 was derived from renewable sources.  Our business in the U.K.  is working to radically transform its business model and has committed to increase total share of electricity from renewable sources from 8% to 14% within three years.  All energy used in manufacturing and distribution is to be from renewable sources within 15 years.  In 2008,  PepsiCo U.K.  reduced its energy use by 118% and doubled its renewable electricity use from 8% to 16%.  > More information about PepsiCo UK is environmental commitments and progress At our snacks operation in Turkey,  projects varying from small to very large scale have been implemented,  such as Solar Tube Lighting,  Stack Heat Recovery,  Boiler Management,  Heat Exchanger Bundle Replacement,  and Online Energy & Water Consumption Monitoring Database.  At our facility in Tarsus,  the installation of the first industrial-scaled solar power system at PepsiCo International was completed in 2008.  This pioneering 
At our Sabritas facility in Toluca,  Mexico,  we installed an anaerobic wastewater treatment plant that produces biogas with 60% methane content.  The gas will be used to produce electricity through a microturbine with the intention to reduce fuel consumption at the plant.  With the help of these projects,  10000 MWh of fossil fuel energy has been saved; these savings helped to reduce 13000 tons of CO2 emission,  which is equal to the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by 40000 trees.  green building and design PepsiCo is commitment to saving energy through green building worldwide continued in 2008.  Our newly constructed facilities were designed to meet the U.S.  Green Building Council is (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards—one of the most rigorous standards for green building in the world.  PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB) has implemented a policy whereby all new construction will be certified through the USGBC LEED program.  During 2008,  PepsiCo Chicago continued its green building construction initiatives by certifying two additional facilities under the USGBC LEED program.  In April 2008,  the new Gatorade manufacturing plant in Pryor,  Okla, achieved LEED Gold certification,  and in October 2008 the Chicago headquarters building was awarded LEED Silver certification as an existing building.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
The Pryor Gatorade manufacturing plant,  now the largest LEED-Gold-certified food and beverage manufacturing facility in the world,  achieved its certification in part by reducing energy intensity by approximately 40% and water use intensity by 50% when compared to an average facility.  To achieve LEED-Silver certification,  the Chicago Plaza reduced energy use by 10% in less than a year,  cut water to 37% below the Energy Policy Act performance standards,  and eliminated almost 226 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through energy-saving programs.  The Chicago headquarters building also installed combined solar and wind generation systems to provide a portion of the electrical power needs for the recently constructed Sustainability Center.  The wind power generating system at the Plaza is the first functioning wind-to- electricity generating system in the downtown Chicago area.  The Sustainable Engineering Guidelines support a transformation of the company infrastructure through green design.  In May 2008,  PepsiCo introduced the Sustainable Engineering Guidelines based on LEED standards.  The guidelines support our environmental sustainability commitments throughout our engineering process,  and apply to all new construction as well as major remodels of existing buildings globally.  The Sustainable Engineering Guidelines can be accessed through a website available to all PepsiCo engineers and key partners worldwide.  This website provides guidelines for: ōSite selection ōConstruction activity management ōWater use reduction ōBuilding materials ōBuilding systems ōPlant process management ōIndoor air quality ōSite stewardship ōLighting systems In addition to evaluating the feasibility of LEED certification for new buildings,  we apply PepsiCo is Sustainable Engineering Guidelines to ensure that every project manager in the world 38 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
has a common set of guidelines and approved solution sets to ensure that they design and build in an environmentally responsible way.  The Resource Conservation (ReCon) tool was developed to facilitate the rapid transfer of best practices around the world.  The tool includes Energy and Water User Profilers and a customizable online site audit or diagnostic.  ReCon is now in its third year of deployment and is rapidly spreading to PepsiCo operations around the globe.  beverage coolers and vending machines Marketing equipment (coolers/vending machines) affects the environment through the use of electricity and refrigerants.  PepsiCo is committed to reducing the impact of our marketing equipment through design and process changes developed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  PepsiCo has a long track record of improving the energy efficiency of its vending machines and coolers.  On average2008 model vending machines,  which all meet EPA Energy Star requirements,  use 51 percent % less energy than 2003 modelsand 2008 coolers consume 44 percent% less energy than their 2004 counterparts.  In addition,  PepsiCo was also the first in the industry to mandate that the foam used to insulate its vending machines and coolers be free of HFCs.  Through these improvements,  PepsiCo has reduced GHG emissions from its refrigeration equipment by 598000 metric tons,  an average of 282000 metric tons per year —the equivalent of removing 52000 cars from the road or planting 125000 trees annually.  PepsiCo is testing thousands of machines around the world that rely on other green refrigerants—specifically isobutane and propane—that also have a lower climate impact than current HFC refrigerants.  fleet Sabritas,  our snack food business in Mexico,  has 13000 distribution vehicles,  about 6000 of which were converted over the past 10 years to burn liquid propane gas.  This reduces carbon and nitrogen emissions and generates fuel savings of between 15% and 22% (depending on geographic conditions and fuel costs).  
In the U.S.,  both Frito-Lay and our bottlers use advanced routing technologies and have a  no-idle" policy to reduce miles and cut fuel consumption on delivery routes.  Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG)our largest bottler,  has verified the electronic settings on vehicles with electronic controls to ensure that idling reduction and speed parameters are set efficiently.  PepsiCo and Frito- Lay have joined SmartWay,  a voluntary partnership between various freight industry sectors and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that establishes incentives for fuel efficiency and GHG emissions reductions.  By 2012,  this initiative is expected to save up to 25 billion liters of fuel per year (equivalent to 150 million barrels of oil).  The Frito-Lay Fleet Team is also hard at work to reduce its carbon intensity.  Through active partnership with the EPA SmartWay program,  the Fleet Team is investigating ways to improve miles per gallon (MPG) and reduce the environmental footprint of our delivery fleet.  In 2009,  1200 high-MPG sprinter delivery trucks were ordered and placed into service.  These sprinter vehicles almost double the fuel efficiency of our current vehicles,  taking MPG from the 8-10 range up to 18.  Other fuel savings initiatives such as GPS Route Optimization,  Idle Shut-Downs,  Tractor and Trailer Aerodynamics,  and improved fleet maintenance practices have also been executed to further improve fuel efficiency and reduce the fleet is environmental footprint.  In 2008,  our U.K.  operation was able to reduce food miles and associated CO2 emissions for two major products.  For Walkers Crisps,  we continued to transition from a blend of U.K. - and European-sourced potatoes to focus on sourcing 100% raw British potatoes.  Local potato production has reduced potato miles into U.K.  plants.  In 2008,  total raw potato into Walkers plants was 385000 metric tons.  By sourcing from local British farmers,  a savings of 800 metric tons of CO2 was achieved through mileage reduction vs.  2007.  Additionally,  a further savings on these deliveries of 34003 metric tons of CO2 was achieved through bio-diesel vs.  2007.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
Partnering for Change We continue to develop external partnerships focused on strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2008 PepsiCo strengthened its partnership with the U.S.  EPA is Climate Leaders program.  Frito-Lay joined Climate Leaders in 2002 and PepsiCo joined in 2007,  setting a goal to reduce greenhouse emissions in the United States 25% by 2015 from a baseline year of 2006.  In announcing the goal last Fall,  PepsiCo stressed the critical role energy conservation will play in achieving the target.  PepsiCo participates actively in various organizations that provide thought leadership to governments and regulators throughout the world.  These organizations include U.S.  CAP in the U.S.,  the WBCSD,  the WRI,  the Carbon Trust,  and others.  PepsiCo believes that its active participation in these respected organizations allows us to be competitively positioned relative to other companies to adapt to changes in the climate change regulatory environment.  By working with the Carbon Trust and the Earth Institute at Columbia,  PepsiCo has gained unique insight into the carbon footprint of our product portfolio.  This insight enables us to communicate more effectively with customers,  consumers and regulatory organizations about our carbon footprint and the best strategies to reduce it.

PepsiCo has joined with other multinational corporations and Greenpeace in a global initiative called 'Refrigerants Naturally!" Its goal is to address climate change and ozone layer depletion caused by Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrigeration equipment.  We are working together to eliminate use of HFCs in refrigerated point-of-sale equipment.  We are also experimenting and testing natural refrigerants,  which may be required in the future.  In 2008,  PepsiCo gained significant insight into the risks and opportunities it has relative to climate change,  first through a comprehensive study of future risks and secondly through an aggressive and broad-based effort to understand the full carbon footprint of our products.  Specifically in 2008,  PepsiCo joined with the U.K.  not-for-profit organization Forum for the Future in a project called Global Scenarios and Strategies for 2030.  In this effort,  PepsiCo and Forum for the Future combined to analyze critical risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental and social factors.

ōA reduction in the environmental and social impacts of agricultural operations that support our business 
Supporting the Long-Term Success of Our Farmers 
In addition to the agriculture policies,  the PepsiCo Worldwide Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct include standards highlighting how we expect our people and our suppliers to conduct business aligned with our environmental sustainability values.  
As a food and beverage company,  agriculture is perhaps the largest element of our eco-footprint,  so we work hard to continually improve our agricultural processes.  This year,  we developed and published our Global Sustainable Agriculture Policy,  which demonstrates our approach to sustainable development across our entire agriculture supply chain,  including water savings,  waste reuse,  soil protection and chemical use.  Our Policy addresses six broad objectives within the agriculture supply chain: ōWater Management ōSoil Conservation and Preservation ōAgrochemical Management ōEnergy Management ōFarm Economics and Land Management ōSocial and Community Improvement To support the implementation of the Policy,  we established a PepsiCo-wide governance structure called the Sustainable Agriculture Council (SAg Council).  This council is staffed by agro-scientists,  engineers and sustainability professionals from across all of our PepsiCo businesses.  The purpose of the SAg Council is to provide leadership and subject matter expertise within and across PepsiCo is Global Operations to assure: ōA strategic global sustainable agriculture vision for PepsiCo ōUniform,  accurate,  and system-wide metrics,  standardsand practices in accordance with PepsiCo is SAg policy ōDevelopment of long- and short-term global SAg goals ōAccurate messaging to internal and external stakeholders ōDevelopment and maintenance of strategic partnerships with suppliers,  advisory board members and external SAg organizations

> Download our Sustainable Agriculture Policy PepsiCo has implemented numerous strategies at the regional and brand levels to support and drive our agricultural and environmental policies; several more are highlighted below as they relate to each of the six objectives: 1.  WATER MANAGEMENT: PepsiCo aims to optimize the applied water footprint to crops and to reduce water waste during irrigation,  as well as responsibly manage runoff risks of pollution or contamination of ground or surface water with pesticides,  nutrients or soil.  ōIn China,  PepsiCo invested in a potato farm in the inner Mongolian desert.  We installed the necessary infrastructure (roads,  electric supply),  water-conserving pivot irrigatorsand soil-conserving crops (sea willows,  trees) to protect from erosion due to sandstorms.  By partnering with the local farmers,  we established a rotation of commercially viable crops (winter wheat,  potato,  sorghum,  and corn) with an initial water savings of 50% by moving from traditional flood irrigation to pivot.  We are continuing this evolution from pivot to drip irrigation with the aim of conserving 70% of the water needed over traditional farming methods—the equivalent of avoiding additional water consumption of nearly 025 billion liters per year for the operation.  A critical component of the community engagement portion of this project—besides the farmer interest—is the installation of local libraries to promote literacy and education in the communities.  2.  SOIL CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION: PepsiCo aims to preserve and improve soil fertility and nutrients,  minimize soil loss through erosion,  and avoid soil damage due to disease and contamination.  
ōFrito-Lay North America has developed and implemented protocols to wash potatoes at the farm to reduce/eliminate the residual soil shipped to our plants,  thereby allowing this soil to be redistributed at the farm rather than disposed of through the plants' waste water discharge,  and also reducing diesel fuel requirements.  ōIn China,  through various collaborations,  our foods team is successfully growing potatoes under desert conditions.  PepsiCo installed the infrastructure needed for transportation,  planted erosion-protective crops,  and replaced the traditional practice of flood irrigation with water-sparing pivots.  By utilizing in-plant conservation approaches,  coupled with the installation of pivot irrigation systems,  in 2006 our China team saved over a billion liters of water compared to the prior year.  The China team is also evolving further from pivot to drip irrigation in 2008with the aim of reaching 70 % water conservation for these systems.  As part of this collaborative effort with the communities,  our local business is also building libraries for local children to improve their education and literacy.  ōIn Brazil,  a soil conservation initiative for potatoes has been ongoing and involves minimal soil preparation to reduce soil degradation,  along with a fuel consumption analysis to decrease fuel use by reducing tractor use and machinery size.  Sustainability benefits: reduced soil erosion,  water use,  and diesel consumption,  along with reduced potato losses due to soilborne diseases,  resulting in a 5% water reduction and 20% savings on irrigation costs.  3.  AGROCHEMICAL MANAGEMENT: PepsiCo aims to reduce the use of pesticides,  nutrients,  and other agrochemicals by optimizing agricultural operations.  PepsiCo supports sustainable practices that substitute natural controls for agrochemicals,  foster ecosystem balance,  reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions,  and reduce crop losses.  ōFrito-Lay North America initiated an organic line of snacks including Tostitos Organic Blue Corn Tortilla Chips,  Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Puffs,  and Lay is Natural Country BBQ Potato Chips.  The company will follow the U.S.  Department of Agriculture is standards in labeling organic products.  
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
ōFrito-Lay has also developed potato varieties that store longer and are resistant to disease and better adapted to adverse climatic conditions,  allowing Frito-Lay North America to grow its potatoes in the most efficient agronomic areas in the U.S.  This results in higher production per acre,  which minimizes the use of all farm inputs,  including energy,  water,  fertilizer,  pesticides and herbicides.  ōIn Saudi Arabia and Egypt,  climate and soil moisture measurement and recording systems were implemented to potato crop fields to forecast blight disease,  with a view toward more optimized use of chemicals.  This has resulted in fewer chemicals being used and greater disease control.  These systems are now also installed in Pakistan.  4.  ENERGY MANAGEMENT: PepsiCo aims to optimize the use of energy in crop production and management of agricultural waste to improve economics for the farm and reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.  ōQuaker supplies over 200 million pounds of oat hulls as raw material ingredients and as a renewable source of fuel for the generation of steam at the University of Iowa.  One hundred percent of the oat hulls are utilized as either a raw material or fuel source,  reducing dependence on less renewable sources of fuel.  Generation of steam through use of oat hulls as fuel source reduces dependence and use of non-renewable fuel sources.  5.  FARM ECONOMICS AND LAND MANAGEMENT: PepsiCo supports sustainable agriculture practices that enable farmers to improve product value by maximizing the desired outputs of an agricultural system while minimizing the required inputs and avoiding any negative impacts to the farm and surrounding environment.  PepsiCo works with farmers who develop long-term economic plans of efficient and responsible farm production.  ōFrito-Lay North America practices optimal crop rotation policies that result in improved soil fertility.  Frito-Lay continuously develops new growing areas closer to their manufacturing plants,  reducing the diesel fuel used to transport inbound potatoes.  They also share agricultural best practices with all of their corn and potato growers.  46 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
The practices include crop rotation,  low- and no-till soil preparation,  cover crops,  and irrigation using efficient pivots.  ōQuaker has been a leader for decades in the oat industrydeveloping new oat varieties that deliver increased field yields and improved disease resistance.  Improving field performance through new oat varieties reduces producer inputs of fertilizers,  fungicides,  and herbicides.  Quaker encourages the use of low-till practices on oats that conserve both water and fuel.  ōTropicana utilizes virtually every part of the orangeincluding the peels,  which are sold as cattle feed.  Before the peel is dried into cattle feed,  Tropicana extracts valuable oils,  essences,  and biodegradable solvents.  SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT: PepsiCo invests in new knowledge and innovation in farming practiceswhich can improve both social and human capital of the local economies.  Sustainable agriculture practices can help to make the best use of local and available resources to improve the welfare of communities supporting our agriculture supply chain.  
ōThe launch of a social education program focused on training farmers ōThe purchase of contracts with corn producers ōThe increased use of technology to produce higher yields.  ōSabritas' participation to date has helped more than 300 low-income corn producers receive funding,  technical support and training,  which has resulted in an estimated 9300 tons of corn production across 2000 hectares.  The three-year program is expected to provide farmers with resources for a 300% increase in income,  an 80% improvement in land productivity,  and 37000 hours of education.  Throughout the program,  Sabritas works toward an improved understanding of the farmers' needs to become independent business partners.  The program also benefits our business.  Strengthening the capabilities of our suppliers located near our manufacturing facilities means saving warehouse and transportation costs as well.  We know that engagement with rural farming communities and private-public partners is integral to delivering the positive social,  environmental and economic impacts of this program.  
In Mexico,  our snack food business Sabritas actively participates in a program that contributes to the overall development of low-income farming families in corn-producing communities.  In partnership with the Mexican Foundation for Rural Development (FUNDAR),  Sabritas contributes to technical and business training for farmers,  transfers relevant technology to the communities and initiates farming contracts.  Sabritas and FUNDAR intend to incrementally bring about profound cultural change in these communities that will lead to the creation of small,  sustainable agribusinesses.  At the onset,  the program began in the state of Jalisco,  located near Sabritas' facility in Guadalajara,  and now spans six municipalities in Mexico.  Sabritas pledged 91 million pesos to fund several initiatives,  including: ōThe organization of corn producers to use their collective bargaining power to better negotiate competitive contract prices for corn crops 
PepsiCo invests in innovative farming practices and education to improve the welfare of the communities that support our agricultural supply chain.

By contributing to the overall development of low-income farming communities,  Sabritas is helping reduce poverty while improving productivity,  profitability,  and sustainability of smallscale farming.  
ōCargill,  our largest supplier of palm oil,  is a founding member of the RSPO,  and has recently announced that one of their plantations has been certified by the RSPO.  ōIn the U.K.,  our Walkers business switched from palm oil to 100% high oleic sunflower oil (Sunseed) to make their famous crisps.  ōFrito-Lay North America moved out of palm oils as its primary cooking oil in the 1980s.  As of 2005,  Frito-Lay North America primarily uses corn and sunflower oils,  as they are among oils lower in saturated fat,  and do not contain trans fats.  
Sabritas works toward an improved understanding of its farmers' needs to become independent business partners.  
Sustainable Palm Oil PepsiCo currently uses palm oil in some of our products around the world.  We are making efforts in a number of regions to convert to oils that are lower in saturated fat.  These are steps in the right direction to continue to make our product offerings healthier.  However,  in some parts of the worldsupply is largely limited to palm oil,  which is the world is predominant cooking oil.  When we purchase palm oil,  we seek supply partners who operate responsibly and in a sustainable manner.  PepsiCo is joining the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to help bring about a greater supply of sustainable palm oil.  
47 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
We are working every day within the PepsiCo system to operate in a more sustainable fashion.  In particular,  we are focusing on reducing our environmental footprint—including energy,  water,  and packaging.  As a customer,  we seek supply partners who will take responsible actions to address these issues.  The production of palm oil involves a wide variety of constituents,  ranging from small independent growers to large multinational suppliers; thus,  it will take the efforts of consumers,  NGOs,  governments and groups like tThe RSPO to effect meaningful changes.  
Biodiversity Agriculture is one of the leading causes of biodiversity lossand it is in our interest to make sure that our supply chains are environmentally sustainable.  As the climate changes,  food and water supplies will be increasingly vulnerable and prone to disruption.  We can minimize these risks by helping to promote healthy ecosystems and sustainable agriculture at the origins of our supply chains.  PepsiCo believes that protecting and enhancing biodiversity is vital to the sustainability of our planet and ecosystems,  and we have begun to explore improvements we can make with pilot projects in key places like India and China.  In the coming years,  we have an opportunity to take a leadership position in our industry by scaling up this work and becoming a force for biodiversity conservation across all of the regions where we operate.  We will accomplish this by: ōInvesting directly in the conservation of key landscapes and marine areas.  ōContinuing the development of clearer environmental standards,  metrics,  and scorecards in our supply chains.  ōEngaging our consumers and employees by helping them to understand the nature of the biodiversity problem and how they can make a difference by consuming responsibly and supporting conservation themselves.  In addition to these initiatives,  PepsiCo developed enterprisewide responsible standards for effluent to protect ecosystems into which we discharge effluent from our manufacturing locations.

Our employee wellness program,  called HealthRoadsrecognizes that good health and well-being is a journeynot a destination.  HealthRoads successfully motivates and enables employees to lead healthy lives by seeking preventive care,  making behavioral changes to reduce health risks,  and working one-on-one with a health coach to manage an existing condition.  HealthRoads is comprehensive in scope.  Its primary focus is diet,  exercise and nutrition.  However,  it enables employees around the globe to address a wide variety of potential health risks,  including stress,  tobacco use,  sleep deprivation,  diabetes,  asthma,  high cholesterol and high blood pressure.  In addition,  HealthRoads uses multiple modes (online resources,  print materials,  one-on-one coaching) to maximize its accessibility,  reach and effectiveness with our employees.  HealthRoads is currently available in 21 countries,  including the U.S.,  Australia and Canada.  Moving forward,  we are rolling out the program in additional countries,  including Mexico,  the European Union and the Middle East,  by 2012.  One of our primary challenges is engaging employees from diverse cultures,  in which attitudes differ widely with respect to weight,  diet and one-on-one health coaching.  We are working on alternative approaches to engage our diverse population.  The confidentiality and privacy of personal health information are also global concerns for our employees.

Now in the fifth year of our HealthRoads journey,  we have accomplished key milestones to ensure sustainability and support of this initiative: ōSenior management support: Our leadership team champions employee wellness around the globe.  Their continuing support sets the stage for grassroots acceptance and engagement.  ōWorksite wellness: A key to sustaining a wellness culture is to make it relevant at the local level.  HealthRoads is tailored to meet each participating site is needs by involving local employees in the design and execution of ongoing wellness activities in that particular locationwithin a consistent framework.  ōStrong incentive program: Although good health is its own reward,  incentives motivate and engage employees in the right behaviors.  ōTracking and measurement: We understand the value of data.  For the past four years,  we have been measuring the reduction or elimination of health risks among our 
employees and the financial return on our wellness investment.  Data and results are reported on an aggregate basis,  not an individual basis.  HealthRoads is slowing the rate of increase in PepsiCo is medical costs and is positively impacting the health of our employees and their families.  In the U.S.,  about two-thirds of our employees and their spouses/partners have registered for HealthRoads and 93% of them have completed the personal health assessment.

TALENT SUSTAINABILITY 
Our Employees We recognize our responsibility to take care of our employees Employee Learning and Development Increasing the skills of our employees is crucial for business success in a competitive global economy.  Outside of the leadership area,  PepsiCo has traditionally approached the functional organizational learning and knowledge management aspects of development from a primarily decentralized perspective.  Each division handles its functional organizational learning and knowledge management locally.  As a result,  each division has developed its own set of functional competency models.  To foster consistency where appropriate,  we have developed crossdivisional functional competency models for Sales,  MarketingFinance and Human Resources.  These models are used as the basis for building career frameworks that described certain job roles and responsibilities.  These tools are available on our internal learning management and career development websites.  PepsiCo also offers associates specific job training as requiredincluding attending professional conferences to enhance their skills,  and we have a robust program for helping associates manage their careers.  Elements include a guide for career growth tailored to PepsiCo,  as well as guides focused on specific functions.  Our yearlong proprietary career process includes objective setting,  performance and development reviews,  development action plans,  mid-year reviews,  and 360-degree evaluations,  all supported by training and materials.  Executive leadership training focuses on helping high-potential managers learn to be more effective leaders and to gain a broader perspective of our business.  All employees are included in some form of performance management process across PepsiCo.  As a guide for associates in all functions and at all levels of our organization,  we have the PepsiCo Leadership and Individual Effectiveness Model.  The model details the key competencies 
51 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
and associated behaviors that are required-individually and collectively-to assure that we reach our performance goals.  Regardless of current role,  level,  or career aspiration,  every associate can use the model to understand which behaviors they should strive for today and what will contribute to their own personal success,  as well as success for PepsiCo.  360 Degree Feedback at PepsiCo is an annual process for executives and people managers across all divisions of PepsiCo.  While we have always had a robust 360 program,  in 2008 the process was enhanced to be even more focused on building self-awareness of the participants by linking results to a best-in-class personality assessment inventory (the Hogan Assessment Suite).  The process now requires mandatory follow-up feedback meetings with certified professionals (based on a custom-designed three-day certification program) in the 360 program and personality tools to ensure a highquality and rigorous feedback and development planning discussion.  Evaluation results from the program in 2008 were extremely positive,  with 86% of respondents indicating that the integration of the 360 feedback with the Hogan Assessment Suite helped them gain valuable leadership insights into ways they can maximize their effectiveness.  Beginning in 2008,  we aligned our 360 degree feedback process with the PepsiCo Leadership and Individual Effectiveness Model to make it more robust and to ensure that leaders know and understand what is expected of them.  As a new and significantly valuable addition,  we will combine the 360-degree process with other feedback tools to further build self-awareness and provide participants with rich,  one-on-one developmental feedback from trained and certified facilitators.  For our entire executive and professional population (all salaried employees at all levels),  we have a formal performance evaluation system with separate Business and People objectives that our employees are evaluated on each year.  As part of the performance appraisal process,  our entire executive and professional population is required to have a mid-year review with their manager,  and employees provide input on their results against their objectives.  All individuals receive a formal written feedback form that follows a standard process,  including summary highlights and developmental 
opportunities.  Formal written feedback is signed by the employee,  the employee is manager,  the next level managerand Human Resources leadership.  Individual performance objectives include measures relating to the company is Performance with Purpose agenda in each of our three sustainability planks (Environmental,  Human and Talent) as well as improved operating efficiencies,  customer and employee satisfaction,  and for all people managers,  their performance as it relates to the management and development of people.  Front-line employees in certain operating divisions and in certain functions (primarily sales and manufacturing operations) receive feedback directly from their managers/ supervisors on an ongoing basis in real time and do not require the same type of objectives-based process.  We also ask associates to respond to an Organizational Health survey biannually.  The Organizational Health survey provides developmental feedback to people managers throughout the organization.  The survey is a global process with a consistent set of core items.  All employees are surveyed in every country in the world for their feedback,  resulting in survey translations into over 35 languages.  Topics include benefits,  working conditions,  compensation,  career development,  diversity and inclusion initiatives,  community activities and many others.  The results of the survey are shared with associates and used at multiple levels (e.g.,  front-line supervisors,  middle managersfunctional VPs,  division and business unit CEOs,  the PepsiCo CEO,  External Advisory Boards,  etc. ) to drive action plans and improvements throughout the corporation.  Results are also leveraged for summaries and action planning of employee issues across various populations,  including African-Americanswomen of color,  Latinos,  Asians,  white males,  women,  and GLBT employees.  
Award Programs PepsiCo offers a variety of award programs to recognize associates.  Common to all businesses are gift awards for length of service.  All associates are also eligible to receive stock option grants as recipients of The Chairman is Award,  a program that recognizes outstanding accomplishments above and beyond an individual is basic job accountabilities and that delivers a sustainable business impact in support of the

company is Performance with Purpose vision.  The Chairman is Award is the highest honor at PepsiCo.  To honor those who have helped PepsiCo advance its commitment to world-class performance in diversity and inclusion,  we have created a unique Chairman is Award called the Harvey C.  Russell Inclusion Award.  Harvey C.  Russell was chosen as the namesake for this prestigious award because his leadership,  perseverance,  and commitment to 'raising the bar" are the foundation upon which PepsiCo is diversity initiative is built.  The Steve Reinemund Diversity & Inclusion Leadership Legacy Award is a PepsiCo leadership award given to senior leaders who champion diversity and inclusion over timeand move PepsiCo to new levels of diversity and inclusion accomplishments and behaviors through their words and actions.  Front-line associates are those who make,  sell,  and distribute our brands.  These associates,  as well as the front-line employees of our bottlers,  are eligible for the President is Ring of Honor.  This annual award inducts high achievers into a permanent role of honor.  We have a variety of other award programs within our divisions.  
Employee Benefit Programs We are continually looking for ways to make PepsiCo a great place to work.  One way we do this is by offering comprehensive benefits packages designed to address the health care and financial needs of our employees,  both now and into retirement.  In the U.S.,  we offer a full range of health care,  savings and retirement benefits.  Our health and welfare benefits include medical,  dental,  vision,  prescription drugs,  mental healthlife and accident insurance,  disability,  and flexible spending accounts.  We also offer commuter reimbursements,  adoption assistance,  employee assistance program,  child and elder care referral and resources,  smoking cessation programscare and lifestyle management programs,  and family and medical leaves.  Domestic partners who meet certain eligibility requirements may be covered under PepsiCo benefits.  Eligible part-time employees receive medical,  dental,  vision,  life 52 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
insurance and disability benefits.  Financial benefits in the U.S.  include company-funded pension plans,  a 401(k) plan with a company match,  the PepsiCo Stock Purchase Program,  and SharePower,  a broad-based stock option program.  SharePower was introduced in 1989 and is a global program that offers eligible employees stock options that may be exercised after a vesting period.  We believe SharePower clearly reflects a culture that places a high priority on ownership.  Currently,  over 90000 PepsiCo employees receive the grant annually.  Outside the U.S.,  benefits are provided through a combination of company-sponsored programs and state programs funded by payroll or other taxes.  PepsiCo has adopted global standards designed to ensure that all employees receive at least basic medical,  disability,  life insurance and retirement benefits,  regardless of location.  The company has an ongoing process in place to review and,  if necessary,  adjust practices in mature markets,  and shape practices in emerging markets against these standards.  
Expanding Opportunities Through Diversity and Inclusion PepsiCo approaches diversity and inclusion as a fundamental business priority.  Our continued innovation and growth requires employees who can understand the needs of international and diverse markets.  We intend to continually evolve our culture so our associates are recognized for their contributions and valued for the unique differences they bring to the workplace.  We are committed to hiring and retaining the best talent to fill each and every job in the corporation.  And we are equally committed to fostering an atmosphere of caring,  open communication and candor among our employees,  where we treat each other with respect.  These fundamental policies are reflected in our PepsiCo Values Statement.  That commitment to diversity continues today.  We place a great deal of emphasis on personal integrity and believe long-term results,  from real accomplishments,  are the only fair way to judge performance.  We respect individual differences 
in culture,  ethnicity and gender.  PepsiCo is committed to equal opportunity for all employees and applicants.  We are committed to providing a workplace free from all forms of discrimination.  We respect the right of individuals to achieve professional and personal balance in their lives.  
Although PepsiCo is a global corporation,  the way it operates is more local in character.  In markets outside the United States,  PepsiCo businesses rely primarily on hiring local managers and employees.  
In the United States,  our Diversity and Inclusion Networks promote a culture where everyone feels they have an equal opportunity to contribute and succeed.  The groups include African Americans,  Latinos/Hispanics,  Asians,  Native Americans,  Women,  Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender,  and EnAble,  for individuals with disabilities.  In addition to our core employee resource groups,  we have the Women of Color Multicultural Alliance and the White Male Inclusion Advisory Group.

those efforts in our businesses' operating plans and budgets where accountability is assigned and performance is measured.  
Risk Management Process PepsiCo is Chief Risk Officer is responsible for heading the company is risk management function,  reporting directly to the CEO.  Our risk management process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly and purposefully.  PepsiCo leverages an integrated risk management framework at the corporate level as well as across divisions to identify,  assess,  prioritizemanage,  monitor and communicate risks across the company.  The infrastructure underlying PepsiCo is risk management framework supports a top-down,  bottom-up viewpoint of the financial,  operational,  strategic and compliance risks facing PepsiCo at various levels of the Company.  This framework includes: ōThe PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC) is a cross-functionalsenior leadership team which identifies,  assesses,  prioritizes and addresses strategic,  reputational and emerging risksand is chaired by PepsiCo is Chairman and CEO.  The PRC is charged with owning the development of mitigation activities and communicating to PepsiCo is Board of Directors,  Audit and/or Compensation Committee.  Meetings are held quarterly,  and from a communications standpoint each risk is owned by a PRC member,  who is responsible for owning and reporting out one of PepsiCo is top risks.  ōThe PepsiCo Executive Committee (PEC),  comprised of a cross-functional,  geographically diverse,  senior management group that meets regularly to identify,  assessprioritize and address strategic and reputational risks ōDivision Risk Committees (DRCs),  comprised of crossfunctional senior management teams that meet regularly each year to identify,  assess,  prioritize and address divisionspecific operating risks ōPepsiCo is Risk Management Office (RMO),  which manages the overall risk management process,  provides ongoing guidance,  tools,  and analytical support to the PEC and the DRCs,  identifies and assesses potential risks,  and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties as well as to 
PepsiCo is Audit Committee and Board of Directors ōPepsiCo Corporate Audit,  which evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures ōPepsiCo is Compliance Office,  which leads and coordinates our compliance policies and practices As a subset of our many risk mitigation capabilities,  PepsiCo has dedicated crisis management resources at corporate and division locations responsible for the crisis management capabilities of the company.

Emerging risks,  which are considered slow to materialize but high impact,  are also addressed within the risk management process.  In addition to the embedded risk management activities that take place each and every day within our normal business processes,  PepsiCo uses an integrated risk management framework to explicitly identify,  assess,  prioritize,  manage OUR BUSINESS 
monitor and communicate risks across the company.  Utilizing the enterprise risk management framework,  the process is intended to deliver risk transparency,  and to provide clear understanding of the level of resiliency of our most critical risks and alignment between management and our Board of Directors regarding the company is risk tolerance.  These deliverables are achieved through the following efforts: ōRisk Identification—This takes place annually from a topdown and bottom-up viewpoint.  Our risk identification efforts seek to evaluate both external sources of risks as well as risk associated with our internal capabilities in the context of achieving our long-term vision (e.g.,  being the premier consumer product goods company focused on the convenient food and beverage category).  Risks are identified on an inherent basis.  ōRisk Assessment —After identifying our most significant inherent risks,  each assessing party (PRC,  DRCs,  RMO) assesses the most significant risks from a probability,  impact and vulnerability perspective.  This assessment requires that we fully understand the existing capabilities,  controlsprograms,  insurance coverage and other mitigating factors that enable an accuracy assessment of the residual risk assessment.  ōRisk Prioritization—After assessment,  all risks that exceed a predetermined threshold are prioritized by both the assessment itself as well as the ability to influence/mitigate.  In addition,  the RMO aggregates the risk assessment information to look for risk interdependencies and common mitigation solutions.  ōRisk Response—Following prioritization,  the PRC and DRCs are required to explicitly determine the response to each significant risk.  The responses include accepting,  avoidingmitigating and transferring (via third-party insurance).  The DRCs also identify which risks need monitoring on an ongoing basis and what measurement index will be used.  Having selected the risk response,  management identifies control activities necessary to help ensure that the risk responses are carried out effectively.  Risk maps are submitted to the RMO by DRCs on a semiannual basis and are used to document specific information about 
61 PepsiCo Corporate Citizenship Report 2008 
identified risks,  including the assessment of the likelihood and impact of the risk,  as well as the risk response and urgency for action.  Risk maps are also used to monitor and track the progress against the mitigation strategies.  In addition,  PepsiCo is corporate risk owners are required to submit annual updates of our top strategic risks to RMO on a periodic basis.  Similar to the DRC risk maps,  these documents capture and prioritize each risk and list mitigation strategies and progress made throughout the year,  as well as a targeted end state for PepsiCo is position with regard to each risk.  
Communication Each DRC is required to summarize its risk management efforts by providing semiannual DRC meeting minutes,  as well as semiannual submission of the division risk map.  For risks disclosed in our annual report,  PepsiCo has assigned Executive Risk Owners responsible for understanding the risk across the company and providing annual updates to the PRCas well as to the Audit Committee or full Board of Directors.  Lastly,  a semiannual risk management update is provided to the PepsiCo Audit Committee to discuss our risk profile,  risk mitigation efforts and risk management process.  > More information about our business risks
